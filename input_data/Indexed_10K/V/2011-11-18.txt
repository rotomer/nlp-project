Inc., the accounting acquirer in the reorganization. (2) Visa U.S.A. Inc. was a non stock corporation and therefore no comparable metric for earnings per share is provided for fiscal 2007. (3) The long term portion of Visa U.S.A. debt was classified as being due within one year at September 30, 2007 because Visa U.S.A. was in default of certain financial performance covenants as a result of the American Express settlement in fiscal 2007. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt during fiscal 2011.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the year ended September 30, 2011, reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. The Reform Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. We expect the interchange and exclusivity regulations, as well as the routing regulations, to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process, and decrease associated revenues. A number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa affiliated networks. We expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year, and the pace of our U.S. revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Because we may have to re examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations, these and other clients will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards. We believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act to some extent through pricing modifications, and working with our clients and other business partners to win 41 Table of Contents merchant preference to route transactions over our network. Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impacts of the Reform Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Reform Act while mitigating some of the negative impacts the Reform Act would have on our current business models. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. Share repurchases. We effectively repurchased 43.0 million shares at an average price of $74.94 per share, for a total cost of $3.2 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011. Of the $3.2 billion, $2.0 billion was executed through the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market, and $1.2 billion was effectively executed through deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. Adjusted Financial Results. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a decrease of $122 million and $79 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non cash, non operating other income in our financial results. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. The following table presents our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2011 and 2010 excluding the impact of this revaluation. Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2011 Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2010 (in millions, except per share data) Net income attributable to Visa Inc. (as reported) $ 3,650 $ 2,966 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (122 ) (79 ) Adjusted net income attributable to Visa Inc. $ 3,528 $ 2,887 Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding (as reported) 707 739 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.99 $ 3.91 Diluted earnings per share (as reported) $ 5.16 $ 4.01 Impact of the revaluation of Visa Europe put option $ 0.17 $ 0.10 We believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period. The reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year was primarily the result of declines in our estimated long term price to earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. We therefore believe that the resulting non operating income recorded is not indicative of Visas performance in these years or future periods. Fundamo acquisition. On June 9, 2011, we acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies, for $110 million. The acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of Visas global strategy to provide the next generation of payments solutions and to provide long term growth opportunities to connect unbanked or under banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.02 for the full 2011 fiscal year. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. PlaySpan acquisition. On March 1, 2011, we acquired PlaySpan, a privately held company whose payments platform processes transactions for digital goods in online games, digital media and social 42 Table of Contents networks around the world, for total potential purchase consideration of up to $225 million. The acquisition of PlaySpan extends Visas capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce in order to expand the scope of payment services available to clients and consumers. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.03 for the full 2011 fiscal year. Sale of investment in Companhia Brasileira de Solu&ccedil;&otilde;es e Servi&ccedil;os (CBSS). On January 24, 2011, our wholly owned subsidiary, Visa International, sold its 10 percent stake in Visa Vale issuer CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Banco Bradesco. CBSS continues to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil, and Visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction. Visas gross proceeds from the sale were $103 million. After receiving regulatory approval during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recognized a pre tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $85 million in the investment income, net line on our consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $44 million. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. We have maintained double digit growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions for the past two years. The increase in payments volume and processed transactions reflects the continuing worldwide shift to digital currency. The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1).

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 43 Table of Contents (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(4) Includes CyberSource transactions prior to the July 2010 acquisition. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are primarily earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues include revenues earned for transactions processed by VisaNet, our secure, centralized global processing platform, CyberSources online payment gateway and PlaySpans virtual goods payment platform. 44 Table of Contents International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments and cash volume and currency conversion activities. Cross border volumes involve transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country and includes both single and multi currency transactions. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and activities related to our recently acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of acquired in technology and other assets, including finite lived intangible assets, obtained in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource, March 2011 acquisition of PlaySpan and June 2011 acquisition of Fundamo. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other cost method investments. 45 Table of Contents Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued double digit growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross border payments volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services, as well as the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entities. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to client incentives as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Reform Act. The new U.S. debit regulations will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the U.S., primarily within service and data processing revenues, through fiscal 2012. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year. We further expect that the pace of our U.S. revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 2% and 1% increase, respectively, in total operating revenues compared to the same prior year periods. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. We do not expect a significant impact from currency fluctuations during the 2012 fiscal year, as the effect of exchange rate movements is minimized through our hedging program. 46 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 4,261 $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 764 $ 323 22 % 10 % Data processing revenues 3,478 3,125 2,430 353 695 11 % 29 % International transaction revenues 2,674 2,290 1,916 384 374 17 % 20 % Other revenues 655 713 625 (58 ) 88 (8 )% 14 % Client incentives (1,880 ) (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (320 ) (326 ) 21 % 26 % Total Operating Revenues $ 9,188 $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 1,123 $ 1,154 14 % 17 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues also benefited from competitive pricing actions which became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as we align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% of growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource, which we acquired in July 2010. As anticipated, this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and a previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non Visa network transactions. Beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year, associated with the pass through of non Visa network transactions, did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Fiscal 2010 data processing revenues also benefited slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting growth of 18% in nominal cross border payments volume. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Other revenues decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third party service provider. As a result, revenues and 47 Table of Contents offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decrease was partially offset by increases in licensing fees and the inclusion of revenue attributable to CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. The increase also reflected growth in other license and royalty fees. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2011 reflecting growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011. Beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the new U.S. debit regulations triggered renegotiations with some of our existing issuing clients and resulted in new contracts with dozens of merchants and some acquirers to win transaction routing preference. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to initiate or renew contracts with merchants and acquirers, which will likely impact our fiscal 2012 results. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17% to 18% for the full 2012 fiscal year. The actual amount of client incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Personnel increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo in July 2010, March 2011 and June 48 Table of Contents 2011, respectively. These acquisitions, combined with other increases in headcount throughout the organization, reflect our strategy to invest for future growth. The decrease in fiscal 2010 reflects lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. Network and processing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non Visa network transactions. Beginning October 2010, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with the pass through of non Visa network transactions did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset; however, this change in presentation resulted in a reported decline in network and processing throughout fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Marketing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third party service provider. As a result, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2012, which is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions, as well as some modest incremental spend associated with our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. Professional fees increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting investment in technology projects to support our strategy for future growth, The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation 49 Table of Contents and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition, as well as charges related to the east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. General and administrative increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, general and administration expenses increased primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Litigation provision increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the absence of the $41 million pre tax gain recorded in fiscal 2010 as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. There were no other significant litigation provisions made during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (32 ) $ (72 ) $ (115 ) $ 40 $ 43 (55 )% (37 )% Investment income, net 108 49 575 59 (526 ) NM (92 )% Other 124 72 2 52 70 73 % NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 200 $ 49 $ 462 $ 151 $ (413 ) NM (90 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the reversal of prior years accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. The decrease in fiscal 2011 also reflects lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. See Note 20 Income Taxes and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investment income, net increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the pre tax gains recognized from our sale of Visa Vale issuer CBSS, partially offset by the absence of the pre tax gain recognized in fiscal 2010 for our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our investments and lower investment balances. 50 Table of Contents Other non operating income primarily reflects non cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rates were 36% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., beneficial changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010, and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. As a result of anticipated beneficial changes to certain state tax laws beginning in fiscal 2012 and other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2012 to 33% to 34%. This rate excludes any potential related non cash impact from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,872 2,691 558 Investing activities (2,299 ) (1,904 ) 1,830 Financing activities (3,304 ) (1,542 ) (2,751 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (9 ) 5 1 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,740 ) $ (750 ) $ (362 ) 51 Table of Contents Operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year to date net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation in the prior year. Both periods also contain other significant operational payments, including those related to client incentives, settlement transactions, other litigation settlement payments and our annual incentive compensation payments, which were broadly consistent year over year. Although we expect the new U.S. debit regulations to moderate the pace of our growth in operating cash in fiscal 2012, we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income, including non controlling interest, of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for client incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher net income and lower litigation settlement payments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income, including non controlling interest, of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for client incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and client incentives. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects purchases of $1.9 billion in U.S. government sponsored debt securities and U.S. treasury securities, the acquisition of PlaySpan and Fundamo for $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, and purchases of property, equipment and technology, which were higher compared to the prior year due to ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by the gross proceeds of $103 million from the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer CBSS. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of $147 million in cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to the construction of our East Coast data center. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects $2.0 billion in repurchases of our class A common stock in the open market, deposits of $1.2 billion into the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $423 million. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1.0 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, a deposit of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $368 million. 52 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of certain series of our class C common shares for $2.6 billion, deposits of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. As of September 30, 2011, $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalent and available for sale investments securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of undistributed earnings of $1.9 billion. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting certain securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A Risk Factors Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial 53 Table of Contents covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2011. U.S. commercial paper program. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2011. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2011 was $2.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2011, our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Long term unsecured debt A+ Stable A1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements 54 Table of Contents of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. During fiscal 2011, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Share repurchase. During fiscal 2011, we used $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43.0 million class A common shares on an as converted basis, including $2.0 billion in open market repurchases and $1.2 billion in deposits into the litigation escrow account. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. We have completed the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in April 2011 and October 2010. In July 2011, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 20, 2012. At September 30, 2011, the July share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $577 million. On October 26, 2011, we announced that our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, subject to the same terms of the July authorization. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends. During fiscal 2011, we paid $423 million in dividends. On October 18, 2011, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $151 million in connection with this dividend in December 2011. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably 55 Table of Contents estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2011, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2011, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2011, the spot P/E ratio was 14.9x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Incs ForwardPrice to Earnings Ratio Payout AssumingAdjusted SustainableIncome of $100 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payoutfor Each $25 million ofAdjusted Sustainable IncomeAbove/Below $100 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $2,500 $625 20 $2,000 $500 15 $1,500 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees accrued benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $74 million, $66 million, and $170 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $54 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2011 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $350 million to $400 million range in fiscal 2012, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. 56 Table of Contents Acquisitions. We acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, on March 1, 2011 and June 9, 2011, respectively. The acquisitions extend our capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce and provide long term growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or under banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Other uses. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2011, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.4 billion of assets and $176 million of liabilities. Of these securities, $176 million, or less than 3%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September, 30, 2011, debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. There was no outstanding debt at September 30, 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2011. 57 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2011. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 2 Visa Europe, Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents future cash payments for client incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase payment product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $151 million as dividends were declared on October 18, 2011 and will be paid on December 6, 2011 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 18, 2011. 58 Table of Contents (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $468 million. At September 30, 2011, we also accrued $65 million of interest and $8 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2011 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Client Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established. We generally capitalize certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2011, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2011. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. 60 Table of Contents Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have 61 Table of Contents resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring Fundamo in June 2011, PlaySpan in March 2011 and CyberSource in July 2010, respectively, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging primarily from 1 to 15 years. See Note 5 Acquisitions and Note 8 Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2011. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step 62 Table of Contents process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we acquired Fundamo and PlaySpan, which resulted in additional goodwill. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization as of September 30, 2011. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets and $553 million of finite lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2011. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the 63 Table of Contents allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $651 million and $627 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $651 million outstanding at September 30, 2011, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $54 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2011. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 64 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at September 30, 2011 and 2010, were $1.2 billion and $135 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2011. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $764 million and $13 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity Price Risk Visa Europe Put Option. We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2011. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $783 million and $766 million and projected benefit obligations were $839 million and $743 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2012, which we expect to make in September 2012.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 65 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, our and the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the year ended September 30, 2011, reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. The Reform Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchants ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. We expect the interchange and exclusivity regulations, as well as the routing regulations, to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process, and decrease associated revenues. A number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa affiliated networks. We expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year, and the pace of our U.S. revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Because we may have to re examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations, these and other clients will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers debit cards. We believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act to some extent through pricing modifications, and working with our clients and other business partners to win 41 Table of Contents merchant preference to route transactions over our network. Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impacts of the Reform Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Reform Act while mitigating some of the negative impacts the Reform Act would have on our current business models. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. Share repurchases. We effectively repurchased 43.0 million shares at an average price of $74.94 per share, for a total cost of $3.2 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011. Of the $3.2 billion, $2.0 billion was executed through the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market, and $1.2 billion was effectively executed through deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. Adjusted Financial Results. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a decrease of $122 million and $79 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non cash, non operating other income in our financial results. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. The following table presents our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2011 and 2010 excluding the impact of this revaluation. Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2011 Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2010 (in millions, except per share data) Net income attributable to Visa Inc. (as reported) $ 3,650 $ 2,966 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (122 ) (79 ) Adjusted net income attributable to Visa Inc. $ 3,528 $ 2,887 Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding (as reported) 707 739 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.99 $ 3.91 Diluted earnings per share (as reported) $ 5.16 $ 4.01 Impact of the revaluation of Visa Europe put option $ 0.17 $ 0.10 We believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period. The reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year was primarily the result of declines in our estimated long term price to earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. We therefore believe that the resulting non operating income recorded is not indicative of Visas performance in these years or future periods. Fundamo acquisition. On June 9, 2011, we acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies, for $110 million. The acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of Visas global strategy to provide the next generation of payments solutions and to provide long term growth opportunities to connect unbanked or under banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.02 for the full 2011 fiscal year. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. PlaySpan acquisition. On March 1, 2011, we acquired PlaySpan, a privately held company whose payments platform processes transactions for digital goods in online games, digital media and social 42 Table of Contents networks around the world, for total potential purchase consideration of up to $225 million. The acquisition of PlaySpan extends Visas capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce in order to expand the scope of payment services available to clients and consumers. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.03 for the full 2011 fiscal year. Sale of investment in Companhia Brasileira de Solu&ccedil;&otilde;es e Servi&ccedil;os (CBSS). On January 24, 2011, our wholly owned subsidiary, Visa International, sold its 10 percent stake in Visa Vale issuer CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Banco Bradesco. CBSS continues to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil, and Visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction. Visas gross proceeds from the sale were $103 million. After receiving regulatory approval during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recognized a pre tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $85 million in the investment income, net line on our consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $44 million. See Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. We have maintained double digit growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions for the past two years. The increase in payments volume and processed transactions reflects the continuing worldwide shift to digital currency. The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1).

Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are primarily earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarters payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues include revenues earned for transactions processed by VisaNet, our secure, centralized global processing platform, CyberSources online payment gateway and PlaySpans virtual goods payment platform. 44 Table of Contents International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross border payments and cash volume and currency conversion activities. Cross border volumes involve transactions where the cardholders issuer country is different from the merchants country and includes both single and multi currency transactions. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and activities related to our recently acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of acquired in technology and other assets, including finite lived intangible assets, obtained in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource, March 2011 acquisition of PlaySpan and June 2011 acquisition of Fundamo. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on managements understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and managements best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other cost method investments. 45 Table of Contents Other non operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued double digit growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross border payments volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services, as well as the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entities. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to client incentives as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Reform Act. The new U.S. debit regulations will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the U.S., primarily within service and data processing revenues, through fiscal 2012. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year. We further expect that the pace of our U.S. revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 2% and 1% increase, respectively, in total operating revenues compared to the same prior year periods. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. We do not expect a significant impact from currency fluctuations during the 2012 fiscal year, as the effect of exchange rate movements is minimized through our hedging program. 46 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 4,261 $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 764 $ 323 22 % 10 % Data processing revenues 3,478 3,125 2,430 353 695 11 % 29 % International transaction revenues 2,674 2,290 1,916 384 374 17 % 20 % Other revenues 655 713 625 (58 ) 88 (8 )% 14 % Client incentives (1,880 ) (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (320 ) (326 ) 21 % 26 % Total Operating Revenues $ 9,188 $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 1,123 $ 1,154 14 % 17 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues also benefited from competitive pricing actions which became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as we align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% of growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource, which we acquired in July 2010. As anticipated, this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and a previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non Visa network transactions. Beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year, associated with the pass through of non Visa network transactions, did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Fiscal 2010 data processing revenues also benefited slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting growth of 18% in nominal cross border payments volume. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Other revenues decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third party service provider. As a result, revenues and 47 Table of Contents offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decrease was partially offset by increases in licensing fees and the inclusion of revenue attributable to CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. The increase also reflected growth in other license and royalty fees. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2011 reflecting growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011. Beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the new U.S. debit regulations triggered renegotiations with some of our existing issuing clients and resulted in new contracts with dozens of merchants and some acquirers to win transaction routing preference. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to initiate or renew contracts with merchants and acquirers, which will likely impact our fiscal 2012 results. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17% to 18% for the full 2012 fiscal year. The actual amount of client incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Personnel increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo in July 2010, March 2011 and June 48 Table of Contents 2011, respectively. These acquisitions, combined with other increases in headcount throughout the organization, reflect our strategy to invest for future growth. The decrease in fiscal 2010 reflects lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. Network and processing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non Visa network transactions. Beginning October 2010, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with the pass through of non Visa network transactions did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset; however, this change in presentation resulted in a reported decline in network and processing throughout fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non Visa networks. Marketing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third party service provider. As a result, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2012, which is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions, as well as some modest incremental spend associated with our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. Professional fees increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting investment in technology projects to support our strategy for future growth, The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation 49 Table of Contents and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition, as well as charges related to the east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. General and administrative increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, general and administration expenses increased primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Litigation provision increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the absence of the $41 million pre tax gain recorded in fiscal 2010 as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. There were no other significant litigation provisions made during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (32 ) $ (72 ) $ (115 ) $ 40 $ 43 (55 )% (37 )% Investment income, net 108 49 575 59 (526 ) NM (92 )% Other 124 72 2 52 70 73 % NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 200 $ 49 $ 462 $ 151 $ (413 ) NM (90 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the reversal of prior years accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. The decrease in fiscal 2011 also reflects lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. See Note 20 Income Taxes and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investment income, net increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the pre tax gains recognized from our sale of Visa Vale issuer CBSS, partially offset by the absence of the pre tax gain recognized in fiscal 2010 for our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our investments and lower investment balances. 50 Table of Contents Other non operating income primarily reflects non cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rates were 36% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., beneficial changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010, and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. As a result of anticipated beneficial changes to certain state tax laws beginning in fiscal 2012 and other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2012 to 33% to 34%. This rate excludes any potential related non cash impact from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,872 2,691 558 Investing activities (2,299 ) (1,904 ) 1,830 Financing activities (3,304 ) (1,542 ) (2,751 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (9 ) 5 1 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,740 ) $ (750 ) $ (362 ) 51 Table of Contents Operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year to date net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation in the prior year. Both periods also contain other significant operational payments, including those related to client incentives, settlement transactions, other litigation settlement payments and our annual incentive compensation payments, which were broadly consistent year over year. Although we expect the new U.S. debit regulations to moderate the pace of our growth in operating cash in fiscal 2012, we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income, including non controlling interest, of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for client incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers litigation obligation. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher net income and lower litigation settlement payments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income, including non controlling interest, of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non cash adjustments for client incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and client incentives. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects purchases of $1.9 billion in U.S. government sponsored debt securities and U.S. treasury securities, the acquisition of PlaySpan and Fundamo for $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, and purchases of property, equipment and technology, which were higher compared to the prior year due to ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by the gross proceeds of $103 million from the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer CBSS. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 6 Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of $147 million in cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to the construction of our East Coast data center. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects $2.0 billion in repurchases of our class A common stock in the open market, deposits of $1.2 billion into the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $423 million. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1.0 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, a deposit of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $368 million. 52 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually required redemption of certain series of our class C common shares for $2.6 billion, deposits of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short term available for sale investment securities, or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. As of September 30, 2011, $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalent and available for sale investments securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of undistributed earnings of $1.9 billion. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting certain securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A Risk Factors Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial 53 Table of Contents covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2011. U.S. commercial paper program. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2011. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2011 was $2.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2011, our credit ratings by Standard and Poors and Moodys were as follows: Standard and Poors Moodys Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short term unsecured debt A 1 Stable P 1 Stable Long term unsecured debt A+ Stable A1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements 54 Table of Contents of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. During fiscal 2011, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Share repurchase. During fiscal 2011, we used $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43.0 million class A common shares on an as converted basis, including $2.0 billion in open market repurchases and $1.2 billion in deposits into the litigation escrow account. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. We have completed the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in April 2011 and October 2010. In July 2011, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 20, 2012. At September 30, 2011, the July share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $577 million. On October 26, 2011, we announced that our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, subject to the same terms of the July authorization. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends. During fiscal 2011, we paid $423 million in dividends. On October 18, 2011, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $151 million in connection with this dividend in December 2011. See Note 15 Stockholders Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.s forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably 55 Table of Contents estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2011, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2011, our estimated long term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2011, the spot P/E ratio was 14.9x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future.

Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees accrued benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $74 million, $66 million, and $170 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $54 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2011 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $350 million to $400 million range in fiscal 2012, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. 56 Table of Contents Acquisitions. We acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, on March 1, 2011 and June 9, 2011, respectively. The acquisitions extend our capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce and provide long term growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or under banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. See Note 5 Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Other uses. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2011, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.4 billion of assets and $176 million of liabilities. Of these securities, $176 million, or less than 3%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September, 30, 2011, debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. There was no outstanding debt at September 30, 2011. See Note 10 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20 year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa Internationals guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2011. 57 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2011. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 2 Visa Europe, Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents future cash payments for client incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase payment product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $151 million as dividends were declared on October 18, 2011 and will be paid on December 6, 2011 to all holders of record of Visas common stock as of November 18, 2011. 58 Table of Contents (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $468 million. At September 30, 2011, we also accrued $65 million of interest and $8 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visas obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2011 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visas obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis and Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Client Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established. We generally capitalize certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, managements ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on managements estimate of each clients performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2011, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price to earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europes projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12 month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europes option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2011. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arms length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. 60 Table of Contents Probability of Exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europes stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europes largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long term P/E calculation) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30 day P/E calculation) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30 day P/E calculation as compared to the long term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicators, as opposed to short term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial markets expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europes adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europes current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europes results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have 61 Table of Contents resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of managements expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires managements judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring Fundamo in June 2011, PlaySpan in March 2011 and CyberSource in July 2010, respectively, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging primarily from 1 to 15 years. See Note 5 Acquisitions and Note 8 Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2011. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two step 62 Table of Contents process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we acquired Fundamo and PlaySpan, which resulted in additional goodwill. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization as of September 30, 2011. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite lived intangible assets and $553 million of finite lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2011. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plans mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the 63 Table of Contents allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $651 million and $627 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $651 million outstanding at September 30, 2011, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $54 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2011. See Note 13 Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 64 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short term available for sale investments and long term available for sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at September 30, 2011 and 2010, were $1.2 billion and $135 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2011. The fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were $764 million and $13 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity Price Risk Visa Europe Put Option. We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2011. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $783 million and $766 million and projected benefit obligations were $839 million and $743 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2012, which we expect to make in September 2012.
