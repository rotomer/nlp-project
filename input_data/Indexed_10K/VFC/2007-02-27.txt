Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation is a leading marketer of branded lifestyle apparel and related products in the United States and in many international markets. (Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms VF, we, us, and our used herein refer to VF Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.) Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, will generally extend across multiple product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to distributors and major employers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus VF operated retail stores. We are organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those categories. These groupings of businesses, referred to as coalitions, are summarized as follows: Product Category Principal VF owned Brands Jeanswear Wrangler , Wrangler Hero , Lee , Riders , Rustler , Timber Creek by Wrangler. Outdoor products The North Face , Vans , JanSport , Eastpak , Kipling , Napapijri , Reef, Eagle Creek Imagewear Red Kap , Bulwark , Lee Sport Sportswear Nautica , John Varvatos 25 Discontinued Operations As part of our strategic plan to shift VFs portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle brands, management and the Board of Directors decided in late 2006 to dispose of the womens intimate apparel business. VFs intimate apparel business includes such leading brands as Vanity Fair , Lily of France , Vassarette , Bestform and Curvation in the U.S., and Lou , Gemma and Belcor in Europe. On January 22, 2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for $350 million in cash. The agreement is subject to government approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007. Because VF has decided to exit this business, the operating results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business were separately presented in 2006 as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, and amounts for prior periods were similarly reclassified. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the operations of the global intimate apparel business contributed $35.3 million, $35.9 million and $75.8 million to net income, respectively. A primary factor in the strong performance in 2004 was a new program with a major private label customer. This private label program declined significantly in 2005. The decline in profits in 2006 and 2005 was driven by lower sales levels and the resulting impact from unused manufacturing capacity and lower overhead cost absorption. In addition to the $35.3 million income from operations in 2006, we recorded a charge of $36.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $10.9 million) for the estimated loss on disposal of the intimate apparel business. The financial impact of the global intimate apparel business on VF will not be significant in 2007. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued operations. Unless otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations. Long term Financial Targets We have established several long term financial targets that guide us in our strategic decisions. We expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return. These targets are summarized below: Revenue growth of 8% per year On a longer term basis, we target revenue growth of 8% per year, with approximately 5% coming from organic growth and 3% from acquisitions. We have met this objective with growth in revenues of 10% in 2006 and 8% in 2005. We 26 have many programs in place to continue to drive organic growth and will continue to aggressively search for opportunities to acquire branded lifestyle apparel businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals. Operating income of 14% of revenues Our gross margins and operating margins have improved in recent years as we have focused on reducing our cost structure and have acquired branded lifestyle businesses that earn higher margins. Our operating margin was 13.3% in 2006 and 13.6% in 2005. The decline of 0.3% from 2005 resulted from the impact of special items reported in both 2005 and 2006. During 2005, we reported two special items including (i) the reduction of certain postemployment benefit accruals in Mexico and (ii) restructuring charges. The net impact on operating income of these special items in 2005 was $13.2 million, benefitting the operating margin by 0.3%. During 2006, VF recorded $14.7 million of restructuring charges, representing a negative impact to operating margin of 0.2%. Many of our businesses currently exceed the 14% benchmark, and all of our coalitions report double digit margins. We constantly pursue cost reduction opportunities in product, distribution and administrative areas. We will continue to evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives, as demonstrated by our decision to exit the global intimate apparel business in 2006. Return on invested capital of 17% We believe that a high return on capital is closely correlated with enhancing shareholder value. We calculate return on invested capital as follows: Income from continuing operations before net interest expense, after income taxes Average common stockholders equity, plus average short and long term debt VF earned a 14.7% return on invested capital in 2006 and a 14.2% return in 2005. Our return in recent years has been impacted by acquisition activity during those periods, as it often takes a period of years to achieve the targeted 17% rate of return for acquired businesses. Nevertheless, we will continue to pursue this ambitious target. Debt to capital of less than 40% To maintain a conservative financial position, we have established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our common stockholders equity, plus combined short and long 27 term debt. We would, however, be willing to exceed this target ratio, on a short term basis, to support appropriate investment opportunities. Despite significant acquisition spending, dividend payments to stockholders and share repurchases over the last three years, this ratio was 19.5% at the end of 2006. All of these factors, plus net debt repayments over the three years and almost $350 million in cash at the end of 2006, demonstrate VFs ability to generate strong cash flow from operations. Dividend payout ratio of 40% Our target is to return approximately 40% of our earnings to our stockholders through a consistent dividend policy. This target was raised in 2006 from 30% in prior years. Management and the Board of Directors increased the dividend by 90% in the second quarter of 2006 from a quarterly dividend rate of $0.29 to $0.55 per share. The 2006 dividend payout was 41.1% of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per share each year for the past 34 years. Management and the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy. Strategic Objectives We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF to achieve its long term revenue and earnings targets. Our growth strategy consists of six drivers: 1. Build more global, growing lifestyle brands. Focus on building more growing, global lifestyle brands with an emphasis on younger consumers and on female consumers. 2. Expand our share with winning customers. Adapt our organizational structure to a more customer specific focus to expand market share and leverage new business opportunities with successful retailers. 3. Stretch brands to new geographies. Grow our international presence, particularly in rapidly expanding economies such as those in the Far East and Eastern Europe. 4. Expand our direct to consumer business. Increase the portion of revenues obtained from VF operated retail stores or other direct to consumer venues. 5. Fuel the growth. Leverage our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF to drive lower costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate acquisitions efficiently so that we can use these savings to invest in our brands. 6. Build new growth enablers. Support our growth plans by identifying and developing high potential employees and by recruiting talented, qualified leaders with new skill sets. 28 Highlights of 2006 There were several notable actions and achievements in 2006: Revenues, income and earnings per share were each at record levels. VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly formed joint venture to design, market and distribute VF branded products in India. Net revenues increased 10% to $6,215.8 million. Nearly all of this increase was attributed to organic growth across our businesses. Income from continuing operations increased 11% to $535.1 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 12% to $4.73. The biggest contribution to these increases was the strong performance of our global Outdoor businesses, particularly driven by superior growth within our The North Face and Vans branded businesses. Net income (including (i) the operating impact in both years of our global intimate apparel business reported as discontinued operations, (ii) the expected loss on the sale of this business recorded in 2006 and (iii) the cumulative effect of the change in accounting policy for stock options recorded in 2005) increased 5% in 2006 to a record $533.5 million, or $4.72 per diluted share. All per share amounts below are presented on a diluted basis. We increased our quarterly dividend by 90%, from $0.29 to $0.55 per share. Our total shareholder return for the year was 52%, consisting of stock price appreciation and dividend yield. Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations Acquisitions VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly formed joint venture to design, market and distribute VF branded products in India for a total cost of approximately $33 million. This acquisition added $13 million to revenues and was neutral to earnings per share in 2006. This business is expected to contribute at least $30 million in incremental revenues in 2007. Subsequent to the end of 2006, we announced the acquisition of Eagle Creek, Inc., seller of Eagle Creek brand packs, luggage, accessories and adventure travel gear, which is expected to add approximately $30 million to revenues in 2007. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our acquisitions over the last three years. Stock Based Compensation As discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(Revised), Share Based Payment 29 (Statement 123(R)), effective as of the beginning of 2005. This Statement requires the recognition of compensation cost for grants of stock options and also modifies the accounting of other forms of stock based compensation. VF recorded in the 2005 Consolidated Statement of Income a noncash charge of $11.8 million (net of income taxes of $7.9 million) as the Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Policy for periods prior to January 2005. Financial statements for 2004 were not restated. As a result of adopting this Statement, stock based compensation increased from $10.0 million in 2004 to $40.0 million in 2005 and $46.0 million in 2006. Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues in the last two years: 2006 2005 Compared with Compared with In millions 2005 2004 Total revenues prior year $ 5,654 $ 5,218 Organic growth 502 149 Acquisitions in prior year (to anniversary dates) 47 274 Acquisitions in current year 13 100 Disposition of VF Playwear (87 ) Total revenues current year $ 6,216 $ 5,654 Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues in all of our ongoing businesses increased in 2006, due primarily to unit volume increases, with the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses. Revenues also increased in 2005 over 2004 due to growth in the outdoor businesses. Royalty Income increased significantly in 2006 and 2005 from 2004 due to higher levels of licensing activity related to the Nautica brand. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. The Reef acquisition in 2005 added $47 million to revenues in 2006 (prior to the 2006 anniversary date of its acquisition) and $60 million to revenues in 2005. In January 2005, we acquired Holoubek, a business having rights to manufacture and market T shirts and fleece under the licensed Harley Davidson brand, which added $40 million to 2005 sales. The Reef and Holoubek acquisitions are collectively referred to as the 2005 Acquisitions. 30 In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro countries) improved revenue comparisons by $11 million in 2006 relative to 2005. For 2005, revenue comparisons benefited by $32 million relative to 2004. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was $1.25 per euro during 2006, compared with $1.25 during 2005 and $1.23 during 2004. If the weakening of the U.S. dollar that has occurred in recent months continues throughout 2007, reported revenues in 2007 will be positively impacted compared with 2006. The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of Income: 2006 2005 2004 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 43.4 % 43.2 % 41.2 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 30.1 % 29.7 % 28.5 % Operating income 13.3 % 13.6 % 12.7 % Gross margins increased to 43.4% of revenues in 2006, compared with 43.2% in 2005 and 41.2% in 2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 primarily result from the revenue growth in our higher margin businesses. This change in the mix of our business accounted for an increase in gross margin of 0.4% in 2006 over 2005, offset by the net impact of special items recorded in both 2006 and 2005, discussed in the Long term Financial Targets section above. Gross margins as a percent of Total Revenues increased 2.0% in 2005 over 2004 driven primarily by margin improvement in our outdoor and sportswear businesses resulting from lower sourced product costs. Today, of Net Sales to customers in the United States, 32% relates to products manufactured in VF owned facilities in Mexico and Central America and 67% relates to products obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia. Where we manufacture, it is managements belief that our product costs are generally lower in VF owned facilities than any available on a global basis for like products. We believe a combination of VF owned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses increased as a percent of revenues to 30.1% in 2006, compared with 29.7% in 2005 and 28.5% in 2004. The 2006 increase in percent of 31 revenues resulted from additional spending on advertising in our Jeanswear Coalition and a shift in the mix of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages, specifically, toward our growing lifestyle branded businesses. Our Outdoor businesses, including the more recently acquired brands such as Reef, Vans, Kipling and Napapijri, have higher expense percentages than other VF businesses. Approximately 0.5% of the increase in 2005 over 2004 was due to stock option expense recognized under the new accounting policy adopted in 2005, with the remainder of the increase primarily related to changes in the mix of our businesses similar to those discussed above. We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some other companies classify cooperative advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of Net Sales or Royalty Income, respectively, while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other companies. Interest Expense (including amortization of debt discount, debt issuance costs and the gain on an interest rate hedging contract) decreased by $13.3 million in 2006 and $5.4 million in 2005. The decreases in both 2006 and 2005 were due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled approximately $900 million for 2006, $1,030 million for 2005 and $1,050 million for 2004. The weighted average interest rate was 6.1% for 2006, 6.7% for 2005 and 7.0% for 2004. The effective income tax rate was 31.2% in 2006, compared with 32.2% in 2005 and 33.0% in 2004. During 2006, we recorded a $16.9 million tax benefit (2.2% tax rate benefit) from the favorable audit outcome on certain tax matters outside of the United States. The effective income tax rate declined in 2005 relative to 2004 due to increased income in international jurisdictions that was taxed at lower rates and favorable settlements of prior years foreign and state income tax returns, partially offset by additional taxes resulting from the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income from Continuing Operations increased 11% to $535.1 million in 2006 and by 21% to $482.6 million in 2005 from $398.9 million in 2004. After considering the operating results of our discontinued global intimate apparel business and the expected loss on the sale of this business of $36.8 million, VF reported net income of $533.5 million ($4.72 per share) in 2006. 32 This represented an increase of 5% over reported net income of $506.7 million ($4.44 per share) in 2005, which included an $11.8 million cumulative effect charge ($0.10 per share) for the change in accounting policy for stock based compensation. Net income in 2004 was $474.7 million ($4.21 per share). In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.02 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005 and a $0.04 favorable impact in 2005 compared with 2004. In comparing 2006 to 2005, the Reef acquisition had a $0.03 favorable impact to earnings per share. Information by Business Segment VFs businesses are grouped into four product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of businesses are referred to as coalitions. Both management and VFs Board of Directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent VFs reportable segments. For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition, along with amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. Coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VFs presentation of Coalition Profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies. The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues by coalition during the last two years: 33 In millions Jeanswear Outdoor Imagewear Sportswear Other Total revenues 2004 $ 2,706 $ 1,012 $ 770 $ 619 $ 111 Organic growth (9 ) 119 (4 ) 22 21 Acquisitions in prior year 264 10 Acquisitions in current year 60 40 Disposition of VF Playwear (87 ) Total revenues 2005 2,697 1,455 806 651 45 Organic growth 70 366 22 35 9 Acquisitions in prior year 47 Acquisitions in current year 13 Total revenues 2006 $ 2,780 $ 1,868 $ 828 $ 686 $ 54 Jeanswear: The Jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler and Lee brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were up 3% in 2006 over 2005. Revenues for 2005 versus 2004 were flat. A 3% increase in domestic jeanswear revenues was led by the turnaround of the Lee brand, which posted a 6% increase over 2005. This improvement resulted from more effective increased marketing investments, as well as new products targeted at our core consumer. Our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4% in 2006. These increases were partially offset by the exit of the Earl Jean business in early 2006. In 2005, domestic jeanswear revenues declined 2%, with gains in mass market and western specialty products more than offset by a decline in the Lee brand business. Approximately one half of the sales decrease at Lee was due to the significant consolidation taking place in the mid tier channel of distribution in the U.S. The remainder of the decline was largely due to lack of performance of new products at retail, particularly in the Lee brands traditionally strong womens business. Jeanswear revenues in international markets Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia also increased 3% in 2006 over 2005. Approximately 2% of the increase resulted from our newly established joint venture in India. Revenues increased in all foreign jurisdictions other than Canada, which was flat. Jeanswear revenues in international markets increased by 5% in 2005, with two thirds of the increase due to a $25 million benefit from favorable foreign currency translation. 34 Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.8% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2006. The reduction in margin percentage in 2006 primarily resulted from special items included in both the 2006 and 2005 periods. During 2006, actions were taken within our Jeanswear business to reduce product costs and improve product development processes that cost Jeanswear $14.5 million and negatively impacted 2006 operating margins by 0.5%. During 2005 profits benefited from a $14.7 million reduction in Mexican postemployment benefit accruals, which management had determined were greater than required under local laws. This item positively impacted 2005 operating margins by 0.6%. The remaining decline in operating margins in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on advertising and investments in retail stores overseas. Jeanswear Coalition Profit increased 2% in 2005 over 2004, with comparable increases in both domestic and international businesses. In the United States, profits increased in our mass market business, which more than offset declines in our Lee brand and our Earl Jean business (which was sold in early 2006). In addition, profits in 2005 benefited from the $14.7 million reduction in Mexican postemployment benefit accruals mentioned above. Outdoor: The Outdoor coalition consists of VFs outdoor related businesses including The North Face brand apparel, footwear and equipment, JanSport and Eastpak daypacks and apparel, Vans performance and casual footwear and apparel, Kipling bags and accessories, Napapijri outdoor based sportswear and Reef beach inspired footwear and apparel. Revenues increased 28% in 2006 primarily through organic growth, led by unit volume increases from strong consumer demand for The North Face and Vans products in the United States and internationally. The acquisition of Reef also added $47 million to 2006 revenues (for the period prior to its acquisition anniversary date). Revenues increased 44% in 2005, with the Reef acquisition adding $60 million and the 2004 Outdoor coalition acquisitions adding $264 million (for the period prior to their respective acquisition anniversary dates). Revenues in both years benefited from the favorable effects of foreign currency translation $8 million in 2006 and $6 million in 2005 relative to the respective prior years. Coalition Profit increased 28% in 2006, consistent with the revenue increase above. The operating margin in both 2006 and 2005 for the Outdoor coalition was 16.0%. The 2005 acquisition of Reef added approximately $5 million, or 2%, to Coalition Profit in 2006. Coalition Profit increased 49% in 2005 over 2004. Over one half of the increase in 2005 was due to higher profits resulting from a full year of operations in the Vans, Napapijri and Kipling businesses acquired during 2004. Because Reef was acquired in April 2005, late in its seasonally strong sales season, its contribution to Coalition Profit was minimal in 2005. The remainder of the 2005 increase was due primarily to unit volume increases at The North Face. 35 Imagewear: The Imagewear coalition includes VFs occupational (industrial, career and safety) apparel business, as well as our licensed apparel business. Coalition Revenues increased 3% in 2006. Occupational apparel revenues were up 2%, led by growth in the public services and governmental sector, offset by the exit of our underperforming commodity fleece and T shirt business. Licensed apparel revenues increased 4% in 2006 led by growth in the licensed National Football League business. Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2005, primarily from the acquisition of Holoubek in early 2005. Occupational apparel revenues increased 3% in 2005, primarily in industrial workwear. Sales of industrial workwear were up in 2005 with increased industrial employment in the U.S. Revenues of the licensed business increased in 2005 with the acquisition of Holoubek and increases in sales of products under license from the National Football League and Major League Baseball. Coalition Profit increased 6% in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports apparel. Profits in the uniform/occupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating margin for the Imagewear Coalition increased from 15.7% in 2005 to a record 16.2% in 2006, resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other fixed costs in relation to revenue growth. Coalition Profit increased 8% in 2005 due to lower product costs, improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the Holoubek acquisition. Sportswear: The Sportswear coalition consists of our Nautica lifestyle brand and the John Varvatos luxury collection for men. The coalition also includes the Kipling brand business in North America (whereas the Kipling brand is managed as part of the Outdoor Coalition in Europe). Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2006, including a 4% increase in our Nautica brand revenues and strong growth in our John Varvatos and Kipling businesses. Coalition revenues increased 5% during 2005, including a 3% increase in our Nautica brand revenues and the benefit of a full year of Kipling brand revenues. Sportswear Coalition operating margins were 13.3% in 2006 and 15.4% in 2005. Coalition Profit declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the Fall 2006 introduction of a Nautica brand womens sportswear collection. Coalition Profit for the Nautica brand increased significantly in 2005 over 2004 due to (i) improved product performance at our wholesale customers resulting in fewer markdowns and returns, (ii) cost reductions and (iii) other operating efficiencies. The Kipling business has been profitable in 36 each of the last three years, while the John Varvatos business incurred losses, as planned, in each year. Other: The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business unit of company operated retail outlet stores in the United States that primarily sell excess quantities of first quality VF apparel products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the respective coalitions, while revenues and profits of non VF products (primarily childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic) are reported in this business segment. The Other business segment also includes the results of VF Playwear for 2005 and 2004. Trademarks and certain operating assets of this business were sold in May 2004, with inventories and other assets liquidated over the remainder of 2004 and in 2005. The segment loss in 2004 included net charges of $9.5 million related to the disposal of this business. See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of VF Playwears revenues and losses for 2005 and 2004. Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes: There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows : 37 In millions 2006 2005 2004 Information systems and shared services $ 179.0 $ 157.1 $ 138.7 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (153.0 ) (118.0 ) (110.0 ) 26.0 39.1 28.7 Corporate headquarters costs 84.7 90.2 69.2 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 11.3 7.4 11.6 Other 5.8 0.5 (2.0 ) Corporate and Other Expenses $ 127.8 $ 137.2 $ 107.5 Information Systems and Shared Services Included are costs of our management information systems and of our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. Approximately one half of the increase in gross information systems and shared services costs in 2006 related to information systems development and information technology infrastructure costs. The remainder of the increase resulted from increased spending in our supply chain and customer management groups. A greater proportion of management information systems and other costs was allocated to the coalitions in 2006, primarily related to information systems activations across VF. About two thirds of the increase in 2005, net of amounts apportioned to the coalitions, related to additional information systems costs for common systems implementation and additional consulting costs, with the balance related to start up costs for centralization of sourcing, distribution and other efforts to improve efficiency and drive cost reduction. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The decrease in these costs from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from a reduction in severance costs from 2005. Approximately $8.8 million of the increase from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the initial recognition of stock option expense for corporate management upon adoption of a new accounting standard. In 38 addition, costs increased in 2005 over 2004 due to recruiting, relocation and compensation of additional corporate staff positions to drive growth for VF and due to severance related costs. Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. The increase in these costs in 2006 is consistent with the growth in our business and expansion of our brand portfolio. Costs were higher in 2004 due to foreign currency hedging losses incurred on licensing transactions. Other This category includes (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets Accounts Receivable increased in 2006 due to a 9% increase in fourth quarter revenues over 2005 and an 8% increase in the number of days sales outstanding. There was 20% sales growth during the fourth quarter in our Europe and Asia businesses, where payment terms are substantially longer than those of the U.S. businesses. This accounted for nearly all of the increase in the number of days sales outstanding. Finally, a weaker U.S. dollar accounted for 3% of the increase in the 2006 Accounts Receivable balance over 2005. Inventories increased by 6% in 2006, which was lower than the percentage increase of sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 and the anticipated increase in the first quarter of 2007, resulting in a decline in days sales in inventory. In addition, the increase in 2006 included a 2% impact from translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars, considering the weaker dollar used in translation at the end of 2006, and a 1% impact from the inclusion of the acquired inventory in the joint venture in India. Other Current Assets included an increase in value added taxes arising in slower paying jurisdictions. The additional amounts will be recoverable over the next year. 39 Property, Plant and Equipment increased in 2006. Capital spending in 2006 exceeded depreciation expense. In addition, the 2006 balance increased due to the inclusion of a $43 million leased facility for a new Outdoor Coalition distribution center, recorded as a capital lease. The increase in property, plant and equipment spending was due to expenditures to support the growth of our businesses, including a heavier spend to support new retail store rollouts. Intangible Assets and Goodwill each increased in 2006 due to the impact of foreign currency translation (weaker U.S. dollar) and the acquisition in India in 2006. Other Assets decreased in 2006 due to the elimination of a $42 million intangible asset recognized under previous pension accounting rules. This decrease was offset in part by additional assets held under deferred compensation plans. See Notes B, F, G, H and I to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Payable was relatively flat in 2006 compared with 2005, despite higher overall inventory levels. Accrued Liabilities declined in 2006 due to the 2005 balance including a $75.0 million minimum pension liability accrued under prior accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans. During 2005, we entered into a new international bank credit agreement consisting of (i) a euro denominated five year revolving credit agreement for a U.S. dollar equivalent amount of $230.0 million, (ii) a euro denominated two year term loan for a U.S. dollar equivalent of $52.6 million and (iii) a U.S. dollar denominated two year term loan for $40.0 million. At the end of 2005, there was $220.2 million outstanding under the agreement, of which $100.1 million was classified as Short term Borrowings because of our intent to repay that amount during 2006 and $120.1 million was classified as Long term Debt under the revolving credit agreement because of our intent to continue that amount outstanding through 2006. During 2006, we repaid the U.S. dollar denominated term loan of $40.0 million and $21.8 million of the euro denominated term loan. As of the end of 2006, there was $170.8 million outstanding under the international bank credit agreement, of which $39.4 million was classified as Short term Borrowings and $32.8 million as Current Portion of Long term Debt because of our intent to repay those amounts during 2007. We have no intention of paying down the remaining $98.6 million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement in 2007, and accordingly, that amount is classified as Long term Debt. The Current Portion of Long term Debt is $68.9 million at the end of 2006, including the $32.8 million borrowing under the international credit facility discussed above and the discounted amount of a $33.0 million principal installment due in connection with the 2003 Nautica 40 acquisition. The Long term Debt balance declined from 2005 to 2006 as a result of reclassifying $32.8 million of the revolving credit borrowings under the international facility and the remaining installment under the Nautica acquisition to current. These declines were offset by a capital lease obligation for an Outdoor Coalition distribution center. In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (Statement 158). Statement 158, effective for December 2006, requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be recorded in the balance sheet. Statement 158 also requires that gains and losses for differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results and that unrecognized prior service costs be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Statement 158 results in changes in the balance sheet recognition of defined benefit plans, but does not change the measurement of plan assets and obligations or the measurement of benefit expense in the statement of income. In accordance with Statement 158, prior period financial statements were not restated. See Note N for a discussion of assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plans in VFs 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with their recognition in the 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet under the prior rules. Under the newly adopted Statement 158, at the end of 2006, $143.8 million of the total $146.8 million unfunded pension liability based on projected benefit obligations was recorded in Other Liabilities, with the balance classified in current liabilities. Also in accordance with Statement 158, we recorded a pretax charge of $215.4 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) at the end of 2006. This represented the sum of deferred actuarial losses and deferred prior service costs at that date. At the end of 2005, under the prior accounting rules, the excess of accumulated benefit obligations over the sum of the fair value of plan assets and previously accrued pension liabilities, termed the minimum pension liability, was $171.9 million. This minimum pension liability resulted in a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2005. In addition, $75.0 million of the minimum pension liability was classified as a current liability because VF contributed that amount to the pension plan in early 2006. 41 Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: Dollars in millions 2006 2005 Working capital $ 1,563.2 $ 1,213.2 Current ratio 2.5 to 1 2.1 to 1 Debt to total capital 19.5 % 22.6 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders equity. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 12.1% at the end of 2006. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, which was $454.1 million in 2006, $533.7 million in 2005 and $646.4 million in 2004, is primarily dependent on the level of Income from Continuing Operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components. Income from Continuing Operations was $535.1 million, $482.6 million and $398.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each year included noncash stock based compensation expense of $46.0 million, $40.0 million and $10.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant increase in 2005 was due to the adoption of Statement 123(R) requiring recognition of stock option expense, on a fair value basis, in the financial statements. The net change in working capital components during 2006 was a cash usage of $209.2 million, compared with cash usage of $94.6 million in 2005 and cash provided of $56.0 million in 2004. Major reasons for changes in the year to year cash impact from working capital over this three year period related to (i) an increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2006, as discussed in the Balance Sheets section above, (ii) increases in inventory in 2005 and 2006 due to the growth in our businesses that are not offset by related changes in accounts payable, (iii) increases in accrued incentive compensation (as amounts earned in a year are paid early in the following year), (iv) increases in accrued income taxes due to higher net income and (v) in 2004, approximately $40 million of cash provided by the liquidation of VF Playwears working capital (Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements). To finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balance and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. VF has a 42 $750.0 million unsecured committed bank facility that expires in September 2008. This bank facility supports a $750.0 million commercial paper program. Any issuance of commercial paper would reduce the amount available under the bank facility. At the end of 2006, $740.5 million was available for borrowing under this credit agreement, with $9.5 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. VF also has a $230.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent unsecured committed revolving facility under an international bank credit agreement. At the end of 2006, $85.4 million was available for borrowing under this credit agreement. Further, under a registration statement filed in 1994 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, VF has the ability to offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $300.0 million of additional debt, equity or other securities. The principal investing activity over the last three years related to business acquisitions. We paid cash of $69.8 million, $211.8 million and $649.1 million for acquisitions in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies. Cash paid in 2006 included the discounted amount of a $33.0 million installment note payment related to the Nautica acquisition in 2003. The acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances and short term commercial paper borrowings. All commercial paper borrowings, plus debt of the acquired companies of $28.8 million in 2004, were repaid in the year of acquisition. Capital expenditures were $127.2 million in 2006, compared with $103.0 million and $74.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years generally related to retail and distribution as well as maintenance spending in our worldwide manufacturing facilities. We expect that capital spending could reach $145 million in 2007, with the increase related to distribution projects and to higher retail store investments. Capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. In addition during 2006, VF entered into a capital lease of a distribution center with the present value of lease payments totaling approximately $43 million. During 2005, VF repaid $401.3 million of long term debt at scheduled maturity dates. Also during 2005, VF borrowed a total of $220.2 million under a new international bank credit agreement. During 2006, VF repaid $61.8 million of our borrowings under the international bank credit agreement. See Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Statement 123(R) requires that income tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reported in the Financing Activities section of the Statements of Cash Flows. Accordingly, $24.1 million and $17.7 million of such tax benefits for 2006 and 2005, respectively, 43 were classified in the Financing Activities section, compared with $13.1 million classified in the Operating Activities section under the prior rules in 2004. In January 2007, Standard Poors Ratings Services affirmed its A minus long term corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating, A 2 commercial paper rating and stable outlook for VF. Standard Poors also stated that the ratings and outlook would not be affected by the decision to sell the global intimate apparel business. In June 2006, Moodys Investors Service affirmed VFs long term debt rating of A3 and commercial paper rating of Prime 2 and amended the ratings outlook to stable from negative. In January 2007, Moodys Investors Service affirmed its long term debt rating of A3 and ratings outlook of stable and stated that the ratings and outlook would not be affected by the decision to sell the global intimate apparel business. Existing debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based on changes in credit ratings. During 2006, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a cost of $118.6 million (average price of $59.29 per share). In addition, VF purchased 4.0 million shares of its Common Stock in 2005 at a cost of $229.0 million (average price of $57.25 per share). The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by exercises of stock options. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 9.3 million shares. We currently plan to use the $350 million estimated proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business to repurchase shares during 2007. However, the actual number purchased during 2007 may vary from current expectations depending on funding required to support business acquisitions and other opportunities. Cash dividends totaled $1.94 per common share in 2006, compared with $1.10 in 2005 and $1.05 in 2004. Prior to 2006, our target was to pay dividends representing 30% of our diluted earnings per share on a long term basis. In May 2006, we increased our quarterly dividend by 90%, from $0.29 to $0.55 per share, with the first payment under the new rate beginning with the June 2006 payment date. This resulted in a dividend payout rate of 41.1% in 2006, compared with payout rates of 24.2% in 2005 and 24.9% in 2004. We now expect to pay dividends of at least 40% of our diluted earnings per share on a long term basis. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2007 is $2.20 per share. Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2006 that will require the use of funds: 44 Payments Due or Forecasted by Period In millions Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term debt * $ 1,287 $ 112 $ 142 $ 40 $ 237 $ 22 $ 734 Operating leases 577 114 98 81 76 55 153 Minimum royalty payments 61 21 23 11 4 2 Inventory obligations ** 733 637 15 15 15 15 36 Other obligations *** 550 143 94 53 38 32 190 Total $ 3,208 $ 1,027 $ 372 $ 200 $ 370 $ 126 $ 1,113 * Long term debt, including the current portion, consists of both required principal and related interest obligations. For long term debt having a variable interest rate, the rate at the end of 2006 was used for all years. Amounts of long term debt outstanding under the international revolving credit facility are assumed to be repaid at the end of 2008. Also included are payment obligations for capital leases. ** Inventory purchase obligations represent binding commitments for finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. Included is a remaining commitment to purchase $111.4 million of finished goods from one supplier, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year. *** Other obligations represent other commitments for the expenditure of funds, some of which do not meet the criteria for recognition as a liability for financial statement purposes. These commitments include forecasted amounts related to (i) contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects and (iii) components of Other Liabilities, as presented and classified as noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet, that will require the use of cash. Projected cash requirements for components of Other Liabilities include (i) portions of those liabilities classified in Current Liabilities and (ii) payments of deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. We have other financial commitments at the end of 2006 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: We made discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension plan of $55.0 million in 2005 and $75.0 million in 2006. Future discretionary pension funding contributions are not included in the table because of uncertainty of their amounts and timing. 45 VF has entered into $75.0 million of surety bonds and standby letters of credit representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims obligations. Purchase orders in the ordinary course of business represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements and are therefore excluded from the table. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business. We regularly assess these potential risks and manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by utilizing natural hedges or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts in which the value is linked to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or other financial measures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since 81% of our total long term debt has fixed interest rates, our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings (including short term notes classified as long term under the international revolving credit agreement), which averaged approximately $329 million during 2006. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents on deposit. Based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and of cash on deposit during 2006, the effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates on reported net income would not be material. Approximately 26% of our business in 2006 was conducted in international markets. 46 Substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the United States dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2005, we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for euro denominated borrowings. At the end of 2006, euro borrowings under this agreement totaled 130 million (approximately $170.8 million), which reduces exposure to currency rate changes for our net euro denominated assets. Net investments in our primarily European and Latin American international businesses are considered to be long term investments, and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are included in a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Common Stockholders Equity. We do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the United States dollar. A majority of our total product needs to support our businesses are manufactured in our plants in foreign countries or by independent foreign contractors. We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce VFs overall exposure to exchange rate movements, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows (relating to cross border inventory purchases and production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments anticipated during the following 12 months) by buying or selling United States dollar contracts against various currencies. We monitor VFs foreign currency exposures and may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows. If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with the end of 2006, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $29 million. Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged. VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which indirectly affects fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by ordering denim and other fabrics several months in advance, but we have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. 47 VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants underlying investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. These VF owned investment securities are held in irrevocable trusts. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses, equity compensation or retirement benefits. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 48 Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual style size color stockkeeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving or in excess, we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Long lived Assets Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definite lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets. We review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. This review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if any, attributable to the assets being tested. These evaluations have not resulted in any significant impairment charges during the past three years. We evaluate indefinite lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated discounted cash flows attributable to the trademark or the business to which the goodwill relates. For each of the last three years, the indicated fair value of the indefinite lived trademark assets and goodwill in the business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets. 49 If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if we were to decide to discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business, we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to certain assets or goodwill. We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with any excess recorded as Goodwill. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective, as several of the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows. We use the same assumptions for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition. Stock Options In connection with the adoption of Statement 123(R) in 2005, we began using a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of options than the Black Scholes model used in prior years. More specifically, a lattice model can better incorporate (i) historical patterns and future assumptions about the exercise of stock options, done separately by groups of options holders, in relation to changes in the price of VF Common Stock and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in our 2006 valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise. In 2006 and 2005, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. The average life of stock options was less in 2004 due to different employee exercise behaviors, caused primarily by higher employee turnover related to restructuring actions taken. 50 Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In 2006 and 2005, we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on publicly traded at the money options on VF Common Stock. We measured historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that volatility will start at a level equal to the implied volatility and gradually increase to the historical volatility over the ten year option term. The assumption for volatility was higher in 2004 because the assumption in that year was based only on historical volatility. Pension Obligations VF sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before December 31, 2004. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We update annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments. We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement, termination, death and disability. Specifically during 2006 we updated the assumptions for future compensation increases, retirement and turnover, and during 2005 we updated the mortality assumption to a version of the RP 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for improvements in life expectancy through 2015. We believe these assumptions are reflective of the employee base covered by the plans and represent the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at each valuation date. We evaluate our discount rate assumption at each annual valuation date and adjust it as necessary based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of obligations for participants in our pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service (over 500 such bonds) and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans projected benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates 51 over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans distinct liability characteristics. We believe our 2006 discount rate of 6.0% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans. The discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of inactive participants with vested benefits who will not begin receiving benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investment assets in our pension trust. Because the rate of return is a long term assumption, it generally does not change significantly each year. This rate is based on several factors, including the mix of investment assets, historic and projected market returns on those assets and current market conditions. Our rate of return assumption was 8.25% in 2006 and 8.50% in 2005 and 2004, which were all less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years. The rate of return assumption was lowered in 2006 based on a current evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns. The sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans projected benefit obligations (PBO), all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Dollars in millions Pension Expense PBO 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 10 $ 85 0.50% increase in discount rate (5 ) (79 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 5 0.50% increase in expected investment return (5 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (2 ) (8 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 2 8 Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. During the last several years, actual results have differed significantly from actuarial assumptions, resulting in $195.3 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial 52 losses at our 2006 valuation date. These accumulated losses arose primarily because (i) our pension plan liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount rate from 7.5% in 2001 to 6.0% in 2006 and (ii), although our actual investment return on pension plan assets exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years, significant investment losses were incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets. Our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess of 20% of PBO at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts totaling 10% to 20% of PBO are amortized over 10 years; and amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of investment assets or PBO at the beginning of the year are not amortized. The cost of pension benefits earned by our employees (commonly called service cost) has averaged $21.7 million per year over the last three years. However, pension expense recognized in our financial statements over that period has significantly exceeded the average annual service cost. Our recorded pension expense was $37.5 million in 2006, $35.1 million in 2005 and $49.6 million (including a partial plan curtailment charge of $7.1 million) in 2004. Expense in each of the last three years was higher than the average annual service cost because those years included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). However, our pension expense for 2007 is expected to decrease to approximately $13 million due to significant discretionary funding contributions of $75 million and $55 million in January 2006 and 2005, respectively, and improved investment performance. Our projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets at our most recent valuation date. Accordingly, under the provisions of Statement 158, which was effective at the end of 2006, we recorded a pension liability of $146.8 million representing the underfunded status of our two defined benefit pension plans. The amount of the liability could change significantly in future years depending on securities market fluctuations, interest rates and the level of VF contributions to the plan. Effective December 31, 2004, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing plans to new entrants. The amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after that date, plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as 53 directed by the participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on the 2006 expense for our defined benefit pension plans. Over a period of years, however, the expense of our defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense. In addition, the year to year variability of our retirement benefit expense should also decrease. Income Taxes VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations and have recorded amounts that reflect our best estimates of the probable outcomes related to any such matters. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Adjustments are recorded when these events occur. We do not anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. We have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. An adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount. We have not provided United States income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that period. During 2005, we repatriated certain foreign undistributed earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which contained provisions for a temporary incentive for repatriation of foreign earnings, and accordingly recorded the incremental income tax expense related to the repatriation in our 2005 financial statements. The balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the ultimate resolution of certain tax matters. Since these income tax accruals were established in the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, future changes in these amounts could result in adjustments to Goodwill. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes the recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to meet before being recorded in the financial statements and provides guidance on classification and disclosures of tax positions. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. VF is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements. When FIN 48 is adopted in the first quarter of 2007, the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and to beginning Retained Earnings is not expected to be material. 54 Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1.A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 55 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. A discussion of VFs market risks is incorporated by reference to Risk Management in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report.
