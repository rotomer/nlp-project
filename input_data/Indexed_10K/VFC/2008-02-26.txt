Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle and other apparel products. (Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms VF, we, us, and our used herein refer to VF Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.) Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, will generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus VF operated retail stores and internet web sites. We are organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those categories. These groupings of businesses, referred to as coalitions, are summarized as follows: Coalition Principal VF owned Brands Jeanswear Wrangler, Wrangler Hero, Lee, Riders, Rustler, Timber Creek by Wrangler Outdoor The North Face, Vans, JanSport, Eastpak, Kipling (except in North America), Napapijri, Reef, Eagle Creek Imagewear Red Kap, Bulwark, Majestic Sportswear Nautica, John Varvatos, Kipling (in North America) 28 Contemporary Brands 7 For All Mankind, lucy Discontinued Operations VF sold its womens intimate apparel business in April 2007 for net cash proceeds of $348.7 million. The decision to exit this business was part of the Board of Directors and our strategic plan to shift VFs portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle brands. VFs intimate apparel business included brands such as Vanity Fair, Lily of France, Vassarette, Bestform and Curvation in the United States and Lou, Gemma and Belcor in Europe. Because VF has sold this business, the operating results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business have been separately presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. During 2007 (prior to its sale in April), 2006 and 2005, the operations of the global intimate apparel business contributed $2.9 million, $35.3 million and $35.9 million, respectively, to VFs net income. In addition, we recorded charges for the loss on disposal of the intimate apparel business of $24.6 million in 2007 and $36.8 million in 2006. The book value of the net assets sold included $117.5 million of goodwill and $32.1 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued operations. Unless otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations. Long term Financial Targets In January 2008, we revised our long term financial targets. We expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return (TSR), which is the total of stock price appreciation and dividends received by our shareholders. These targets are summarized below: Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year We increased our long term target revenue growth from 6% to 8% annually to 8% to 10% per year, with approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic growth and 2% to 3% from acquisitions. We have met this overall objective with growth in revenues of 16% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. Key drivers of further growth include a continuation of the strong growth we have experienced in our outdoor businesses, international expansion and continued growth in our direct to consumer business. Our international revenues are expected to expand approximately 13% annually and account for a third of our total revenues by 2012, compared with 28% in 2007. Our direct to consumer business should grow by approximately 18% annually and represent 22% of revenues by 2012, compared with 14% in 2007. We also have many programs in place to 29 continue to drive organic growth and will continue to aggressively search for opportunities to acquire branded lifestyle apparel businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals. Operating income of 15% of revenues We increased our long term targeted operating margin from 14% to 15%. Our operating margins have approached 14% achieving 13.4% in 2007 and 13.3% in 2006, with margins in each of those years negatively impacted by 0.2% from specific actions taken to reduce product costs, enhance product development processes, strengthen our sales and marketing organization and maximize our distribution infrastructure across some of our businesses, primarily in our international jeans operations. We expect continued improvement in our operating margin as we (i) leverage our costs across an expanded revenue base, (ii) grow our international and retail businesses, which have high operating margins and (iii) continue our relentless focus on cost reduction. Our two largest coalitions currently exceed the 15% target. We will continue to evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives and may in the future decide to exit a business that does not meet those objectives, as demonstrated by the sale of the global intimate apparel business in 2007. Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year We established a new target of 10% to 11% annual growth in diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share are expected to grow at a faster rate than revenues, reflecting continued expansion in our operating margins. Our earnings per share increased 14% in 2007 and 12% in 2006. In addition to the new targets discussed above, we maintained the following long term targets: Return on invested capital of 17% We believe that a high return on capital is closely correlated with enhancing TSR. We calculate return on invested capital as follows: Income from continuing operations before net interest expense, after income taxes, Average common stockholders equity, plus average short and long term debt VF earned a 14.8% return on invested capital in 2007 and a 14.7% return in 2006. Our returns in recent years have been impacted by acquisitions during those periods, as it often takes a period of years to achieve the targeted 17% rate of return for acquired businesses. Nevertheless, we will continue to pursue this ambitious target. 30 Debt to capital of less than 40% To maintain a conservative financial position, we have established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our common stockholders equity, plus combined short and long term debt. Despite spending over $1 billion on acquisitions in 2007, this ratio was 26.4% at the end of the year. This low debt to capital ratio, given our significant acquisition spending, dividend payments to stockholders, share repurchase activity and a cash balance of approximately $320 million at the end of 2007, demonstrates VFs ability to generate strong cash flow from operations. Dividend payout ratio of 40% Our target is to return approximately 40% of earnings to our stockholders through a consistent dividend policy. The 2007 dividend payout ratio was 42.7% of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per share each year for the past 35 years. Strategic Objectives We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF to achieve its long term revenue and earnings targets. Our growth strategy consists of six drivers: 1. Build more global, growing lifestyle brands. Focus on building more growing, global lifestyle brands with an emphasis on younger consumers and on female consumers. 2. Expand our share with winning customers. Adapt our organizational structure to a more customer specific focus to expand market share and leverage new business opportunities with successful retailers through cross coalition coordination, planning and execution. 3. Stretch brands to new geographies. Grow our international presence, particularly in rapidly expanding economies such as those in Europe, China, India and Russia. 4. Expand our direct to consumer business. Increase the portion of revenues obtained from VF operated monobrand retail stores and ecommerce. 5. Fuel the growth. Leverage our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF to drive lower costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate acquisitions efficiently so that we can use these savings to invest in our brands. 6. Build new growth enablers. Support our growth plans by identifying and developing high potential employees and by building a diverse team of talented leaders. 31 Highlights of 2007 There were several notable actions and achievements in 2007: Revenues, income, earnings per share and cash provided by operating activities were each at record levels. We formed a new lifestyle brand coalition, Contemporary Brands, currently composed of two acquisitions completed in 2007 Seven For All Mankind, LLC (Seven For All Mankind) and lucy activewear, inc. (lucy activewear). Seven For All Mankind markets the rapidly growing 7 For All Mankind brand of womens and mens premium denim jeanswear and related apparel products in the United States and Europe. lucy activewear is a rapidly growing chain of retail stores marketing lucy brand womens activewear. We completed three additional acquisitions in 2007 Majestic Athletic, Inc. (Majestic), which currently holds exclusive on field uniform rights for all 30 major league baseball teams including supplying each team with on field MLB Authentic Collection outerwear, batting practice jerseys, T shirts, shorts and fleece; Eagle Creek, Inc. (Eagle Creek), maker of Eagle Creek brand adventure travel gear, including accessories, luggage and daypacks; and the brand related assets of a former licensee who had rights to market VFs The North Face brand in China and Nepal (The North Face China). These acquisitions, together with Seven For All Mankind and lucy activewear, are collectively referred to as the 2007 Acquisitions. Total Revenues increased 16% to $7,219.4 million, driven by higher revenues in our outdoor, jeanswear and imagewear businesses, with 10% coming from organic growth and 6% from acquisitions. Income from Continuing Operations increased 15% to $613.2 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $5.41 per diluted share. (All per share amounts below are presented on a diluted basis.) The biggest contributions to these increases were the strong performance of our global outdoor businesses, particularly driven by superior growth within The North Face and Vans branded businesses, and jeanswear branded businesses. We sold our womens intimate apparel business for $348.7 million in cash in April 2007. Net Income (including our global intimate apparel business reported as discontinued operations) increased 11% in 2007 to a record $591.6 million, or $5.22 per diluted share. We increased our quarterly dividend rate from $0.55 to $0.58 per share. 32 Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues during the last two years: 2007 2006 Compared with Compared with In millions 2006 2005 Total revenues prior year $ 6,216 $ 5,654 Organic growth 631 502 Acquisitions in prior year (to anniversary dates) 25 47 Acquisitions in current year 347 13 Total revenues current year $ 7,219 $ 6,216 Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues in most of our ongoing businesses increased in 2007 and 2006, due primarily to unit volume increases, with the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro countries) benefited revenue by $130 million in 2007 relative to 2006 and by $11 million in 2006 relative to 2005. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was $1.36 per euro during 2007, compared with $1.25 during 2006 and 2005. With the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent months, reported revenues in 2008 may be positively impacted compared with 2007. The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of Income: 2007 2006 2005 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 43.5 % 43.4 % 43.2 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 30.1 % 30.1 % 29.7 % Operating income 13.4 % 13.3 % 13.6 % Gross margins increased to 43.5% of revenues in 2007, compared with 43.4% in 2006 and 43.2% in 2005. Gross margins benefited 0.3% in 2007 over 2006 from the mix impact of our higher margin lifestyle businesses representing a higher percentage of total revenues. The 2007 33 comparison also benefited by 0.1% due to the special items in 2007 and 2006 (higher expense in 2006), discussed in the operating margin section of Long term Financial Targets above. These benefits to 2007 were partially offset by higher levels of distressed sales, with lower gross margins, in 2007. Gross margins also benefited 0.4% in 2006 over 2005 as a result of the mix impact resulting from our growing lifestyle businesses. This increase was partially offset by the impact of an adjustment in 2005 to reduce certain postemployment benefit accruals in Mexico, which did not recur in 2006. Today, 26% of our total Net Sales relates to products manufactured in VF owned facilities in Mexico, Europe and Central America and 74% relates to products obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia. Where we manufacture in VF owned facilities, our product costs are lower than any available on a global basis for like products. We believe a combination of VF owned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues were 30.1% of revenues in 2007 and 2006 and 29.7% in 2005. This ratio increased 0.4% in 2007 and 2006 due to a shift in the mix of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages, specifically toward our growing lifestyle branded businesses. The 2007 ratio also increased 0.2% due to the impact of the 2007 Acquisitions, whose operations have not yet been fully integrated within VF. In addition, the specific actions discussed in the operating margin section of Long term Financial Targets above increased this ratio by 0.2% in 2007 and 0.1% in 2006. The increases in 2007 and 2006 over the respective prior years were offset by the impact of beneficial revenue growth in many of our businesses, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses. We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some other apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of Net Sales or Royalty Income, respectively, while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies. Interest income increased $3.3 million in 2007 due to an increase in interest rates and higher cash 34 levels resulting primarily from the timing of the sale of the global intimate apparel business and cash generated from operations. Interest expense (including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of amortization of the gain on an interest rate hedging contract) increased $14.9 million in 2007 due to (i) higher borrowings needed to fund acquisition activity and (ii) higher interest rates on short term debt. Interest expense decreased $13.3 million in 2006 due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt outstanding. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled approximately $1,080 million for 2007, $900 million for 2006 and $1,030 million for 2005. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.4% for 2007, 6.1% for 2006 and 6.7% for 2005. The effective income tax rate was 32.3% in 2007, compared with 31.2% in 2006 and 32.2% in 2005. During 2007 and 2006, we recorded tax benefits of $12.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively, for the favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations outside of the United States. These benefits lowered our annual tax rates by 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively. The 2005 rate benefited from favorable settlements of prior years foreign and state tax returns. Income from Continuing Operations increased 15% to $613.2 million ($5.55 per share) in 2007 and by 11% to $535.1 million ($4.83 per share) in 2006. After considering the effects of discontinued operations and a cumulative effect charge for the change in accounting policy for stock based compensation in 2005, VF reported net income of $591.6 million ($5.22 per share) in 2007, $533.5 million ($4.72 per share) in 2006 and $506.7 million ($4.44 per share) in 2005. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.11 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2007 compared with 2006 and a $0.02 favorable impact in 2006 compared with 2005. Also, the 2007 Acquisitions added $0.09 per share to the 2007 results, and the Reef acquisition (acquired in 2005) had a $0.03 favorable impact to earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005. Information by Business Segment VFs businesses are grouped into five product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of businesses are referred to as coalitions. Both management and VFs Board of Directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent VFs reportable segments. For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net 35 sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition, along with amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. Coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VFs presentation of Coalition Profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies. The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues by coalition during the last two years: Contemporary In millions Jeanswear Outdoor Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other Total revenues 2005 $ 2,697 $ 1,455 $ 806 $ 651 $ 45 Organic growth 70 366 22 35 9 Acquisitions in prior year 47 Acquisitions in current year 13 Total revenues 2006 2,780 1,868 828 686 54 Organic growth 92 470 4 (2 ) 67 Acquisitions in prior year 25 Acquisitions in current year 49 156 $ 142 Total revenues 2007 $ 2,897 $ 2,387 $ 988 $ 684 $ 142 $ 121 Jeanswear: The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler and Lee brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were up 4% in 2007 and 3% in 2006. Domestic jeanswear revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with a 3% increase in our mass market business offset by slight declines in our Lee and specialty businesses. In 2006 domestic jeanswear revenues increased 3% led by the turnaround of the Lee brand, which posted a 6% increase over 2005. Also, our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4% in 2006. These increases were partially offset by the exit of the Earl Jean business in early 2006. 36 Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, increased 13% in 2007 over 2006. Foreign currency translation positively impacted 2007 Jeanswear revenues by $57 million, or 6%. Revenues from the joint venture in India, established in September 2006, contributed 3% of the increase. Revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2007 with the exception of our Latin America operations, where revenues were flat. International jeanswear revenues increased 3% in 2006 over 2005. Approximately 2% of the 2006 increase resulted from our joint venture in India. Revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2006 compared with 2005 other than Canada, which was flat. Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.6% in 2007 and 15.5% in 2006. The operating margin improvement in 2007 was attributed to higher gross margins resulting from (i) growth in our international jeans businesses, where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses, (ii) improved operating efficiencies and (iii) actions taken in the prior year to reduce product cost and improve product development capabilities. Jeanswear operating results include expenses of $8.0 million in 2007 and $14.5 million in 2006 related to these capacity reduction and other actions, which negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. In addition, approximately 0.2% of the improvement in operating margin in 2007 was driven by the gain on the sale of H.I.S trademarks and related intellectual property during 2007. Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 15.5% in 2006 compared with 16.8% in 2005. The reduction in margin percentage primarily resulted from the 0.5% negative impact in 2006 for the capacity reduction and other actions discussed above, combined with the impact of reducing Mexican postemployment benefit accruals in 2005 (0.6% positive impact in 2005), which management had determined were greater than required under local laws. The remaining decline in operating margins in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on advertising and investments in retail stores overseas. Outdoor: The Outdoor Coalition consists of VFs outdoor related businesses including The North Face brand apparel, footwear and equipment, JanSport and Eastpak daypacks and apparel, Vans performance and casual footwear and apparel, Kipling bags and accessories, Napapijri outdoor based sportswear, Reef beach inspired footwear and apparel and Eagle Creek adventure travel gear. Revenues increased 28% in 2007, with 25% organic growth and the remainder from the Eagle Creek and The North Face China acquisitions. The organic growth 37 was led by global unit volume increases and strong consumer demand for our The North Face, Vans, Kipling and Napapijri brands. The growth in these brands, particularly The North Face and Vans, included geographic expansion, opening additional owned retail locations and entering new product categories. Revenues also increased 28% in 2006 primarily through organic growth, led by unit volume increases for The North Face and Vans products in the United States and international markets. The acquisition of Reef also added $47 million to 2006 revenues (for the period prior to its acquisition anniversary date). Revenues in 2007 and 2006 benefited from the favorable effects of foreign currency translation by $73 million and $8 million, respectively. Coalition Profit increased 31% in 2007, with operating margins increasing to 16.4% in 2007 from 16.0% in 2006. The increase was driven by strong revenue growth, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses including distribution and product development. Also, revenue growth was more significant in our international and retail operations, where operating margins are typically higher. These items were offset by higher levels of distressed sales and additional investments in our retail operations. Coalition Profit increased 28% in 2006, consistent with the revenue increase above. The operating margins in both 2006 and 2005 for the Outdoor Coalition were 16.0%. The 2005 acquisition of Reef added approximately $5 million, or 2%, to Coalition Profit in 2006. Imagewear: The Imagewear Coalition includes VFs occupational (industrial, career and safety) apparel business, as well as our licensed apparel business. Revenues in the occupational apparel business declined 3% as many of our industrial customers continue to internalize their manufacturing. This reduction included the impact of exiting our underperforming commodity fleece and T shirt business. Excluding this business, revenues in our occupational apparel business increased slightly in 2007 over 2006. Revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59% due to the acquisition of Majestic, which added $156 million to revenues in 2007. Excluding the impact of the Majestic acquisition, licensed apparel revenues increased 6% led by growth in the licensed National Football League and Major League Baseball businesses. Coalition Revenues increased 3% in 2006 with occupational apparel revenues increasing 2% and 38 licensed apparel revenues increasing 4%. Excluding the impact of the phaseout of our underperforming commodity fleece and T shirt business, occupational apparel revenues increased 6% in 2006 with increased revenues in industrial, career and safety apparel. Licensed apparel revenues increased 4% in 2006 led by growth in the licensed National Football League business. Coalition Profit declined to 14.4% in 2007 from 16.2% in 2006, resulting from competitive factors impacting the pricing of our new programs within the occupational apparel businesses and the impact of the Majestic acquisition, which had lower operating margins than Imagewear Coalition averages. Coalition Profit increased 6% in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports apparel. Profits in the occupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating margin for the Imagewear Coalition increased from 15.7% in 2005 to a record 16.2% in 2006, resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other fixed costs in relation to revenue growth. Sportswear: The Sportswear coalition consists of our Nautica lifestyle brand, the John Varvatos luxury collection for men and the Kipling brand business in North America (whereas the Kipling brand is managed as part of the Outdoor Coalition internationally). Coalition Revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with a 4% decrease in our Nautica brand revenues offset by double digit gains in our John Varvatos and Kipling brand businesses. The overall decline in Nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to challenging conditions in department stores and higher promotional activity in our Nautica retail stores in the second half of 2007. This decrease was offset by increased revenues in our Nautica brand womens sportswear. Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2006, including a 4% increase in our Nautica brand revenues and strong growth in our John Varvatos and Kipling brand businesses. Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 9.6% in 2007 from 13.3% in 2006 due to the impact of revenue decreases in the Nautica brand without comparable expense reduction and increased promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the department store channel in 2007. Both 2007 and 2006 include significant investments in our Nautica brand womens sportswear business. Operating losses resulting from the Nautica womens initiative lowered the overall coalition operating 39 margins by approximately 2% in both years. Sportswear Coalition operating margins were 13.3% in 2006 and 15.4% in 2005. Coalition Profit declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the Fall 2006 introduction of the Nautica brand womens sportswear collection. Contemporary Brands: This coalition was formed in August 2007 with two newly acquired businesses Seven For All Mankind and its 7 For All Mankind brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and lucy activewear and its lucy brand of womens activewear. The Contemporary Brands Coalition operating margin of 17.5% was driven by the high profitability of Seven For All Mankind, a high gross margin business. The lucy activewear business is not currently profitable due to start up costs for new stores and high promotional activity exceeding the earnings contribution of their retail locations. With the roll out of additional stores, profitability is expected in 2009. Other: The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business unit of company operated retail outlet stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of first quality VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non VF products (primarily womens intimate apparel, childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic) are reported in this business segment. The increase in revenues in 2007 was due to VF Outlets sale of womens intimate apparel products obtained from independent suppliers following VFs sale of its intimate apparel business in April 2007 (whereas such revenues prior to April 2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations). Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes: There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. 40 Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows: In millions 2007 2006 2005 Information systems and shared services $ 187.0 $ 179.0 $ 157.1 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (146.4 ) (153.0 ) (118.0 ) Less billings for transition services after sale of intimate apparel business (13.7 ) 26.9 26.0 39.1 Corporate headquarters costs 96.4 84.7 90.2 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 10.9 11.3 7.4 Other 6.1 5.8 0.5 Corporate and Other Expenses $ 140.3 $ 127.8 $ 137.2 Information Systems and Shared Services Included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The growth in the information systems and shared services costs in 2007 and 2006 over the 2005 level is related to increased information systems development, additions to information technology infrastructure and higher centralized supply and sales chain management costs. Also, a greater proportion of management information systems and other costs were allocated to the coalitions in 2006 and 2007, primarily related to new information system implementations during those periods. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The increase in these costs from 2006 to 2007 was driven by higher compensation and other costs. Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. 41 Other This category includes (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets Accounts Receivable increased 20% in 2007 due to a 22% increase in fourth quarter revenues over 2006 and slight improvement in our days sales outstanding. Inventories increased by 19% in 2007 over the prior year. Inventories increased by (i) 13% due to the impact of the 2007 Acquisitions (ii) 3% from the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar and (iii) 3% due to higher levels of inventory in our organic businesses. Property, Plant and Equipment increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and capital spending in 2007 exceeding depreciation expense by $19 million. Capital spending in 2007 supported the growth of our businesses and specifically included an increased level of spending to support new retail store roll outs. Intangible Assets and Goodwill each increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translation (a weaker U.S. dollar). Other Assets increased in 2007 due to (i) the recognition of a $27 million pension asset for the overfunded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan in accordance with FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (Statement 158) and (ii) an increase in assets held under deferred compensation plans. See Notes B, G, H and I to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2007, VF entered into a $1.0 billion domestic senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper. This agreement replaced a similar $750 million agreement. Also in October 2007, certain international subsidiaries, with VF as guarantor, entered into a 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $367.9 million) international senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement, which also replaced a similar 175.0 million agreement. 42 Short term Borrowings at December 2007 included $92.7 million outstanding under the international credit agreement. Short term borrowings at December 2007 were higher than December 2006 because a portion of the 2006 borrowings under the international credit agreement were classified as long term debt because it was expected to remain outstanding for at least 12 months. Accounts Payable increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to higher inventory levels and the timing of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at fiscal year end. Accrued Liabilities increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and higher incentive compensation accruals. Long term Debt increased from 2006 to 2007 due to the issuance of $600.0 million of senior notes in October 2007 (see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements), offset by payment of a note related to the Nautica acquisition and payment of amounts classified in 2006 as long term under the international credit agreement. Other Liabilities increased due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities arising from foreign currency translation, offset in part by an improvement in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Statement 158. This standard, effective for December 2006, requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be recorded in the balance sheet. At the end of 2006, an unfunded pension liability of $143.8 million was recorded in Other Liabilities. This long term liability decreased to $74.4 million at the end of 2007 due primarily to actuarial gains arising from an increase in the discount rate and favorable investment returns on plan assets. See Note N for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans in VFs 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: 43 Dollars in millions 2007 2006 Working capital $ 1,510.7 $ 1,563.2 Current ratio 2.3 to 1 2.5 to 1 Debt to total capital 26.4 % 19.5 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders equity. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 21.1% at the end of 2007. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, which was $833.6 million in 2007, $454.1 million in 2006 and $533.7 million in 2005, is primarily dependent on the level of Income from Continuing Operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components. Income from Continuing Operations was $613.2 million, $535.1 million and $482.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each year included noncash stock based compensation expense of $62.4 million, $46.4 million and $40.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also, we did not make a discretionary contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2007 (because our qualified plan was fully funded based on projected benefit obligations), while operating cash flows included discretionary contributions of $75.0 million in 2006 and $55.0 million in 2005. The net change in operating asset and liability components was a cash usage of $4.2 million in 2007, compared with cash usage of $200.6 million in 2006 and $109.7 million in 2005. Much of the improvement in this area was due to a specific focus on working capital leverage by management at the end of 2007. Major reasons for changes in the year to year cash impact from operating asset and liability accounts in 2007 compared with 2006 included (i) higher than normal accounts receivable at the end of 2006, resulting from very strong international sales near the end of the year to customers with longer payment terms, (ii) unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006 due to the timing of inventory receipts and (iii) unusually high accrued income taxes at the beginning of 2006 due to required tax payments for the prior year. To finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates 44 relying upon continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2007, $989.9 million was available for borrowing under VFs $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit facility, with $10.1 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. Also at the end of 2007, $275.2 million was available for borrowing under VFs 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $367.9 million) senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility. We paid cash of $1,060.6 million, $39.3 million and $211.8 million for acquisitions in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies. The 2007 Acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances, short term commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings were repaid from proceeds of the long term notes issued in October 2007 and cash flows from operations. In addition, we received $348.7 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business in 2007. Capital expenditures were $113.9 million in 2007, compared with $127.2 million and $103.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail and distribution, as well as maintenance spending across our global manufacturing network. We expect that capital spending could reach $145 million in 2008, with the increase related to higher retail store investments. Capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. During 2007, VF received $592.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of 5.95% senior notes due in 2017 and 6.45% senior notes due in 2037. VF repaid $78.1 million under the international bank credit agreements in 2007 and a $33.0 million note related to the Nautica acquisition in each of 2007 and 2006. During 2005, VF repaid $401.3 million of long term debt at scheduled maturity dates. See Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2007, Standard Poors Ratings Services affirmed its A minus corporate credit rating, A 2 commercial paper rating and stable outlook for VF. Standard Poors also assigned its A minus senior unsecured debt rating to VFs $600.0 million unsecured senior notes issued in October 2007. In August 2007, Moodys Investors Service affirmed VFs long term debt rating of A3, commercial paper rating of Prime 2 and stable outlook. Existing long term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment 45 grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. During 2007, VF purchased 4.1 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a cost of $350.0 million (average price of $85.03), using the proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business, and in 2006 purchased 2.0 million shares at a cost of $118.6 million (average price of $59.29 per share). In addition, VF purchased 4.0 million shares of its Common Stock in 2005 at a cost of $229.0 million (average price of $57.25 per share). The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset, on a long term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 5.2 million shares. The Company expects to repurchase 2.0 million shares in 2008. We will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required to support business acquisitions, our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises. Cash dividends totaled $2.23 per common share in 2007, compared with $1.94 in 2006 and $1.10 in 2005. Our dividend payout rate was 42.7% in 2007, compared with payout rates of 41.1% in 2006 and 24.2% in 2005. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2008 is $2.32 per share. Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2008 that will require the use of funds: Payments Due or Forecasted by Period In millions Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term debt(1) $ 2,517 $ 79 $ 78 $ 274 $ 61 $ 61 $ 1,964 Operating leases(2) 702 143 126 105 86 62 180 Minimum royalty payments(3) 483 65 77 81 79 79 102 Inventory obligations(4) 783 705 15 15 15 15 18 Other obligations(5) 603 123 110 65 40 33 232 Total $ 5,088 $ 1,115 $ 406 $ 540 $ 281 $ 250 $ 2,496 46 (1) Long term debt, including the current portion, consists of both required principal and related interest obligations. Also included are payment obligations for capital leases. (2) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance. Such costs, which are not included above, average approximately 18% of the stated minimum lease payments. (3) Minimum royalty payments include any required minimum advertising commitments under license agreements. (4) Inventory purchase obligations represent binding commitments for finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. Included is a remaining commitment to purchase $92.5 million of finished goods from one supplier, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year. The reported amount excludes inventory purchase liabilities included in Accounts Payable at December 2007. (5) Other obligations represent other commitments for the expenditure of funds, some of which do not meet the criteria for recognition as a liability for financial statement purposes. These commitments include future cash payments for Other Liabilities, as presented and classified as noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as (i) forecasted amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. Forecasted cash requirements for components of Other Liabilities include (i) portions of those liabilities classified in Current Liabilities and (ii) payments of deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. We have other financial commitments at the end of 2007 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: We made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan of $75.0 million in 2006 and $55.0 million in 2005. We did not make any contribution to this plan in 2007. We are not required to and do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution during 2008 because the plan is fully funded at the end of 2007 based on projected benefit obligations. Future discretionary pension funding contributions are not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether further contributions will be required. VF has entered into $79.4 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims obligations. 47 Purchase orders in the ordinary course of business represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments and are therefore excluded from the table. During 2007 VF met its obligations when due by issuing commercial paper for operating activities, borrowing under a short term bank facility, issuing $600.0 million principal amount of publicly traded notes and entering into new domestic and international credit agreements on terms substantially similar to its previous agreements. Credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the United States and global capital markets during the last half of 2007 caused by subprime mortgage risk exposures did not have a significant impact on VF. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business, and we regularly assess these potential risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within VF or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate or other financial asset or index. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since all of our long term debt has fixed interest rates, our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate borrowings, which averaged approximately $396 million during 2007. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents on deposit. Based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash on deposit during 2007, the effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates on reported net income 48 would not be material. VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 28% of our revenues in 2007 were generated in international markets. Substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2007, we entered into a new international bank credit agreement that provides for euro denominated borrowings. At the end of 2007, euro borrowings under this agreement totaled 63 million ($92.7 million), which reduces exposure to currency rate changes for our euro denominated net assets. Net advances to our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe, Latin American and Asia, are considered to be long term, and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Common Stockholders Equity. We do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar. We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for specific foreign currency transactions or a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on VFs U.S. dollar cash flows, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions or cash flows being hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows anticipated during the following 12 months (relating to cross border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Although VF is exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts, we believe these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions and do not anticipate nonperformance. If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2007, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $30 million. Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged. 49 VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which indirectly impacts fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance. VF has not historically managed, nor do we currently intend to manage, commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, equity compensation, pension benefits and self insured liabilities. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that we place an order for inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant estimates, assumptions 50 and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style size color stockkeeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving or excess quantities, we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. Long lived Assets We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with any excess purchase price recorded as Goodwill. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective, as the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows. We use the same assumptions of future cash flows for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition. 51 Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definite lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets. Specifically for customer related intangible assets, we review historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers, and for license related intangible assets, we review historical trends and expected license renewal rates. We review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. This review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if any, attributable to the assets being tested. These evaluations have not resulted in any significant impairment charges during the past three years. We evaluate indefinite lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets by comparison with the fair value of the indefinite lived trademark. The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is assessed by comparing the book value of the underlying business to its fair value. Since fair value is generally based on discounted cash flows, it requires managements assumptions and judgment regarding business strategies, future revenues and profitability, and a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in those future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of a business reporting unit were to decline, or if we were to decide to discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business, we may be exposed to an impairment charge, which could be material, related to intangible assets or goodwill. For each of the last three years, the indicated fair value of the indefinite lived trademark assets and goodwill in the business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets. For the reporting unit whose estimated fair value was closest in dollar terms to its carrying value, the estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 18%. Stock Options Since our adoption of Statement 123(R) in 2005, we have been using a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical patterns and future assumptions about the exercise of stock options for each of several groups of option holders in relation to changes in the price of VF Common Stock and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as 52 assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in each valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise. In each year, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In each year, we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short term (up to 6 9 months) publicly traded near the money options on VF Common Stock. We measured historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term. Pension Obligations VF sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before December 31, 2004. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We update annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments. We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement, termination, disability and mortality. Specifically during 2006 we updated the assumptions for future compensation increases, retirement and turnover, and during 2005 we updated the mortality assumption to a version of the RP 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for improvements in life expectancy through 2015. We believe these assumptions are reflective of the employee base covered by the plans and result in 53 the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at each valuation date. We adjust, as necessary, our discount rate assumption at each annual valuation date based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of obligations for participants in our pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service (approximately 500 such bonds that are noncallable or with make whole provisions) and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans projected benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans distinct liability characteristics. We believe our 2007 discount rate of 6.40% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans. The discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investment assets in our pension trust. Our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk. The rate of return is the weighted average of expected long term asset return assumptions for the various classes of assets held by the plan. Return assumptions are based on several factors, including the mix of investment assets, historic and projected market returns by asset class and current market conditions. Our rate of return assumption was 8.25% in 2007 and 2006 and 8.50% in 2005, which were less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years. During 2008, the target mix of investment assets will be altered, with part of the change being to increase the portion of fixed income investments and to lengthen the average duration of those investments to more closely match expected benefit payments. The purpose of this change in plan investments is to better match the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our plans investment assets with the benefit obligations they are intended to fund, thereby reducing the year to year variability of our plans funded status and resulting pension expense. Based on these planned 54 changes in investment mix, an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, we will be lowering the rate of return assumption to 8.00% for 2008. The sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans projected benefit obligations (PBO), all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Dollars in millions Pension Expense PBO 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 6 $ 84 0.50% increase in discount rate (2 ) (78 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 5 0.50% increase in expected investment return (5 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (1 ) (11 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 1 11 Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. During the last several years, actual results have differed significantly from actuarial assumptions, resulting in $87.2 of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses at our 2007 valuation date. These accumulated losses arose primarily because (i) our pension plan liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount rate from 7.5% in 2001 to 6.4% in 2007 and (ii), while our actual investment return on pension plan assets exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years, significant investment losses were incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets. Our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess of 20% of PBO at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts totaling 10% to 20% of PBO are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants; and amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of investment assets or PBO at the beginning of the year are not amortized. The cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees (commonly called service cost) has averaged $21.4 million per year over the last three years. Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was $13.1 million in 2007, $37.5 million in 2006 and $35.1 million in 2005. Expense in each of 2006 and 2005 was significantly higher than the average annual service cost because those years included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net 55 unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Our pension expense for 2007 decreased significantly due to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased plan investment assets arising from discretionary funding contributions of $75.0 million and $55.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and improved investment performance. Our pension expense for 2008 is expected to be comparable to the 2007 level. In our qualified defined benefit pension plan, the fair value of plan assets exceeded projected benefit obligations, which resulted in a $27.4 million pension asset at our most recent valuation date. Our unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan resulted in a $77.5 million pension liability. The funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could change significantly in future years depending on securities market fluctuations, interest rates and the level of VF contributions to the qualified plan. Effective December 31, 2004, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing plans to new entrants. The amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after that date, plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as directed by the participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our pension expense, or total retirement benefit expense, over the last three years. However, over a period of years, the expense of our defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense, and the year to year variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease. Income Taxes VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential issues under the more likely than not standard of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. To the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established, or to the extent we are required to 56 pay amounts greater than established accruals, our income tax expense could be materially affected in the period of resolution. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. We have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. An adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount. We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that period. The balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the ultimate resolution of certain tax matters. Since these income tax accruals were established in the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, future changes in these amounts could result in adjustments to Goodwill. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. 57 Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1.A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 58 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. A discussion of VFs market risks is incorporated by reference to Risk Management in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report.
