Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle and other apparel products. Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, will generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus VF operated retail stores and internet websites. VF is organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those categories. These groupings of businesses, referred to as coalitions, are summarized as follows: Coalition Principal VF owned Brands Outdoor and Action Sports The North Face, Vans, JanSport, Eastpak, Kipling (except in North America), Napapijri, Reef, Eagle Creek Jeanswear Wrangler, Wrangler Hero, Lee, Riders, Rustler, Timber Creek by Wrangler Imagewear Red Kap, Bulwark, Majestic Sportswear Nautica, John Varvatos, Kipling (in North America) Contemporary Brands 7 For All Mankind, lucy Discontinued Operations VF sold its womens intimate apparel business in April 2007. The decision to exit this business was representative of our strategic plan to shift VFs portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle brands. Because VF has sold this business, the operating results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business have been separately presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about the discontinued operations. Unless otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations. Impact of the Current Global Economic Environment The global economy reflected significant volatility and change during 2008 declines in residential and commercial real estate values that spread across the globe, rapid and extreme changes in commodity prices and currency markets, sharp declines in global securities markets, rising unemployment, and a credit and liquidity crisis leading to the current global recession. VF reported record revenues and earnings per share in each of its first three quarters and full year of 2008. However, our fourth quarter performance was negatively impacted by the deteriorating global economic environment and its impact on consumer spending. There is every indication that these difficult economic conditions will continue through 2009. 25 In response to these market conditions and the expectation that they would continue, we took an aggressive approach to reducing costs, resulting in a charge of $41.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. These cost reduction initiatives are expected to result in cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in 2009. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long term Financial Targets In January 2008, we revised two of our long term financial targets and added a new earnings per share growth target. We expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return (TSR), which is the total of stock price appreciation and dividends received by our shareholders. While the revenue and earnings growth targets are not expected to be achieved in 2009, we have not revised our longer term outlook. These targets are summarized below: Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year At the beginning of 2008, we increased our long term revenue growth target from 6% to 8% per year to 8% to 10% per year, with approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic growth and 2% to 3% from acquisitions. We had exceeded the prior target by achieving revenue growth of 16% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. In 2008, our revenues increased by 6%. Key drivers of future growth consistent with the 8% to 10% target include a continuation of the strong momentum we have experienced in our outdoor and action sports businesses, growth in our contemporary brands and sportswear businesses, acquisitions of key lifestyle brands, international expansion and continued growth in our direct to consumer business. We expect our international revenues to expand approximately 13% annually and account for 33% of our total revenues by 2012, compared with 30% in 2008. Revenues in our direct to consumer business are also expected to grow by approximately 18% annually and represent 22% of revenues by 2012, compared with 16% in 2008. We have many programs in place to continue to drive organic growth across our brands and will continue to aggressively search for opportunities to acquire branded lifestyle businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals. Operating income of 15% of revenues We increased our long term targeted operating margin from 14% to 15%. Our operating margins had approached the original 14% target in 2007 and 2006. However, operating margins declined to 12.3% in 2008, reflecting the negative impact from cost saving actions of 0.8% primarily related to workforce reductions and the current difficult global economic conditions, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. We expect future improvement in our operating margin as we (i) leverage our costs across an expanded revenue base, (ii) grow our international and retail businesses, which have higher than VF average operating margins, (iii) continue our relentless focus on cost reduction and (iv) grow existing lifestyle brands that report higher than VF average operating margins. Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year We established a new target of 10% to 11% annual growth in diluted earnings per share and believe that earnings per share can grow at a faster rate than revenues, reflecting expansion in our operating margin. We had exceeded this growth rate in recent years. With the impact of the cost reduction actions and global economic events mentioned above, earnings per share were flat in 2008. On a long term basis, we expect our growth rate of earnings per share to be in line with the new target. In addition to the revised and new targets discussed above, we maintained the following long term targets: Return on invested capital of 17% We believe that a high return on capital is closely correlated with enhancing TSR. We calculate return on invested capital as follows: Income from continuing operations before net interest expense, after income taxes Average common stockholders equity, plus average short and long term debt VF earned a 13.5% return on invested capital in 2008 and a 14.8% return in 2007. Our returns in these years were impacted by our 2008 cost reduction initiatives and by acquisitions in 2007. Newly acquired businesses generally have a lower than average return on invested capital in their earliest years of ownership. Debt to capital of less than 40% We have established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our common stockholders equity, plus combined short and long term debt. This ratio was 25.2% at the end of 2008. This low debt to capital ratio demonstrates VFs ability to generate strong cash flow considering the level of dividend, share repurchase and acquisition spending over the last several years. 26 Dividend payout ratio of 40% Our target is to return approximately 40% of earnings to our stockholders through a consistent dividend policy. The 2008 dividend payout ratio was 43.0% of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per share each year for the past 36 years. We evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives and may in the future decide to exit a business that does not meet those objectives, as demonstrated by the sale of the global intimate apparel business in 2007. Strategic Objectives We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF to achieve its long term revenue and earnings targets. Our growth strategy consists of six drivers: 1. Build more global, growing lifestyle brands. Focus on building more growing, global lifestyle brands with an emphasis on younger consumers and on female consumers. 2. Expand our share with winning customers. Develop brand and product strategies that will enable us to gain market share with successful, growing retail partners. 3. Stretch brands to new geographies. Grow our international presence, particularly in expanding economies such as those in China, India and Russia. 4. Expand our direct to consumer business. Increase the portion of revenues obtained from VF operated monobrand retail stores and e commerce. 5. Fuel the growth. Leverage our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF to drive lower costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate acquisitions efficiently to generate savings that can be reinvested in our brands. 6. Build new growth enablers. Support our growth plans by identifying and developing high potential employees and by building a diverse team of talented leaders. Highlights of 2008 There were several notable actions and achievements in 2008: Revenues and earnings per share were both at record levels. Total Revenues increased 6% to $7,642.6 million, driven by higher revenues in our outdoor and action sports, international and direct to consumer businesses and the benefit of a full year of ownership of the contemporary brands businesses. With $679.5 million of cash flow from operating activities, VF had adequate liquidity to cover all of its current needs, as well as fund $217.6 million of investments in capital expenditures and acquisitions, $255.2 million of dividends paid and $149.7 million of repurchases of our Common Stock. We ended the year with $381.8 million of cash and equivalents. And with our investment grade credit rating, we continue to have access to the capital markets, despite the credit crisis in late 2008. At the end of 2008, we had the ability to borrow over $1.3 billion under committed bank credit agreements. We took aggressive actions to address the uncertainty posed by current economic conditions and to protect our future profitability. These cost reduction actions should bring about annualized savings of approximately $100 million, beginning in 2009. The actions resulted in a $41.0 million charge in the fourth quarter. In May 2008, VF acquired one third of the outstanding equity of Mo Industries, which owns the Splendid and Ella Moss brands of premium sportswear marketed to better department and specialty stores. VF expects to acquire the remaining two thirds equity in the first half of 2009. Mo Industries had total revenues of $95 million for the full year 2008. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues during the last two years: 2008 2007 Compared with Compared with 2007 2006 In millions Total revenues prior year $ 7,219 $ 6,216 Organic growth 120 631 Acquisitions in prior year (to anniversary dates) 291 25 Acquisitions in current year 13 347 Total revenues current year $ 7,643 $ 7,219 Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues increased in 2008 due to overall unit volume increases and organic growth in our outdoor and action sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of operations of our contemporary brands businesses acquired in 2007. The impact of the 53rd week in 2008 was not significant to VFs operating results. Revenues in most of our businesses increased in 2007, with the largest growth in our outdoor and action sports and jeanswear businesses. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro countries) benefited revenue by $109 million in 2008 relative to 2007, and $130 million in 2007 relative to 2006. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was $1.47 per euro during 2008 compared with $1.36 during 2007. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months to $1.39 per euro at December 2008, reported revenues in 2009 are expected to be negatively impacted compared with 2008. The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of Income: 2008 2007 2006 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 43.9 % 43.5 % 43.4 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 31.7 30.1 30.1 Operating income 12.3 % 13.4 % 13.3 % Gross margins increased to 43.9% of revenues in 2008, compared with 43.5% in 2007 and 43.4% in 2006. Gross margins increased 0.5% in 2008 from the impact of our lifestyle businesses, which have gross margin percentages higher than VF averages, representing a higher percentage of Total Revenues. The slight increase in the gross margin percentage in 2007 over 2006 was also due to our higher margin lifestyle businesses representing a higher percentage of Total Revenues. In 2008, 77% of our total Net Sales related to products sourced from contractors, primarily in Asia, and 23% related to products manufactured in VF owned facilities in Mexico, Europe and Central and South America. We believe a combination of VF owned and contracted production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues were 31.7% of revenues in 2008 and 30.1% in both 2007 and 2006. This ratio increased 1.4% in 2008 due to the growth in our direct to consumer business, which has a higher expense ratio. Our direct to consumer business represented 16% of total VF revenues in 2008 and 14% in 2007. In addition, the specific cost reduction actions discussed in the Highlights of 2008 section of the Overview above increased this ratio by 0.6% in 2008. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other spending reductions. While the 2007 ratio was flat compared with 2006, the 2007 ratio reflected the net impact of the higher expense ratios of our 2007 acquisitions and the cost reduction actions taken in 2007, offset by the beneficial impact of revenue growth in many of our businesses, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses. 28 We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs as a reduction of Net Sales and licensing costs as a reduction to Royalty Income. Further, some classify retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies. Interest income decreased $3.2 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense (including bank fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain) increased $21.9 million in 2008 due to an increase in debt balances related to the issuance of $600.0 million of senior long term notes in October 2007 to fund our 2007 acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by lower short term borrowing rates. Interest expense increased $14.9 million in 2007 due to (i) higher borrowings needed to fund acquisition activity and (ii) higher interest rates on short term debt. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled approximately $1,454 million for 2008, $1,080 million for 2007 and $900 million for 2006. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.3% for 2008, 6.4% for 2007 and 6.1% for 2006. The effective income tax rate was 28.9% in 2008, compared with 32.3% in 2007 and 31.2% in 2006. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded tax benefits of $24.6 million, $12.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively, for the favorable tax outcomes upon audits in several international locations and from expirations of statutes of limitations in locations where tax contingencies were recorded for open tax years. These benefits lowered our annual tax rates by 2.9%, 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively, for 2008, 2007 and 2006. During 2008, we also recorded tax benefits of $11.5 million due to updated assessments of previously accrued amounts. These benefits lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 1.4%. The remainder of the decline in the effective income tax rate in 2008 from 2007 was attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than the United States as well as VF average effective rates. Income from Continuing Operations decreased 2% to $602.7 million in 2008 from $613.2 million in 2007, while earnings per share increased to $5.42 in 2008 from $5.41 in 2007. Cost reduction actions taken during 2008 lowered earnings per share by $0.41. Cost reduction actions completed in 2007, partially offset by the gain on exiting the H.I.S business, reduced 2007 earnings per share by $0.06. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.15 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2008 compared with 2007. Discrete tax items accounted for an incremental benefit of $0.16 in 2008 earnings per share over 2007. Earnings per share increased slightly in 2008 on lower Income from Continuing Operations due to the reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008. After considering the effects of discontinued operations, VF reported net income of $591.6 million ($5.22 per share) in 2007 and $533.5 million ($4.72 per share) in 2006. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.11 per share favorable impact in 2007 compared with 2006. Net income for 2007 also benefited by $0.09 per share from the acquisitions made in 2007. Information by Business Segment VFs businesses are grouped into five product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of businesses are referred to as coalitions. Both management and VFs Board of Directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent VFs reportable segments. We have recently realigned our management structure within our former Outdoor Coalition to better capture future opportunities in the outdoor and action sports industries. As a result, we have renamed that coalition the Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition. For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition, along with amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing Operations 29 Before Income Taxes. To leverage the scale of VF, there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions. Accordingly, coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VFs presentation of Coalition Profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies. The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues by coalition during the last two years: Outdoor and Action Contemporary Sports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other In millions Total revenues 2006 $ 1,868 $ 2,780 $ 828 $ 686 $ $ 54 Organic growth 470 92 4 (2 ) 67 Acquisition in prior year 25 Acquisitions in current year 49 156 142 Total revenues 2007 2,387 2,897 988 684 142 121 Organic growth 341 (145 ) (30 ) (50 ) 2 2 Acquisitions in prior year 14 33 244 Acquisition in current year 13 Total revenues 2008 $ 2,742 $ 2,765 $ 991 $ 634 $ 388 $ 123 Outdoor and Action Sports: The Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition consists of VFs outdoor and action sports related businesses including The North Face brand apparel, footwear and equipment, Vans performance and casual footwear and apparel, JanSport and Eastpak daypacks and apparel, Kipling bags and accessories, Napapijri outdoor based sportswear, Reef beach inspired footwear and apparel and Eagle Creek adventure travel gear. Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition Revenues increased 15% in 2008 led by global unit gains from strong consumer demand for our The North Face, Vans, Kipling, Napapijri and Eastpak brands. The growth in these brands, particularly The North Face and Vans, included geographic expansion and the opening of additional owned retail locations. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 11%, while international revenues increased 21%, with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for $57 million or 6% of this increase. Revenues increased 28% in 2007, with 25% organic growth and the remainder resulting from the Eagle Creek and The North Face China acquisitions in 2007. The organic growth was led by global unit volume increases in our The North Face, Vans, Kipling and Napapijri brands. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 24% in 2007, while international revenues increased 35%, with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for $73 million or 11% of this increase. Coalition Profit increased 16% in 2008, with operating margins increasing to 16.6% from 16.4% in 2007. The increase was driven by higher revenues, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses, and growth in our international and retail operations, where operating margins are higher. These improvements were partially offset by an $8.3 million charge related to cost reduction actions that negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3%. Coalition Profit increased 31% in 2007, with operating margins increasing to 16.4% in 2007 from 16.0% in 2006. The increase was also driven by strong revenue growth and the improved leverage of operating expenses and higher revenues in our international and retail operations. These improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of higher levels of distressed sales and additional investments in our retail operations. Jeanswear: The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler and Lee brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were down 5% in 2008 and up 4% in 2007. Domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8% in 2008 and were flat in 2007 compared with 2006. The decline in 2008 resulted from a very difficult retail environment caused by the deteriorating global economy that impacted the 30 Lee, mass market and western specialty businesses. In 2007, a 3% increase in our mass market business over 2006 was offset by slight declines in our Lee and specialty businesses. Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, increased 2% in 2008 over 2007 and 13% in 2007 over 2006. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international jeanswear 2008 revenues by $50 million, or 5%, and 2007 revenues by $57 million, or 6%. Revenues on a constant currency basis were down in 2008, reflecting difficult economic conditions in key European countries and the sale of the H.I.S business in 2007, which accounted for $25 million of revenues in that year. These declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our Asia businesses. Revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2007 over 2006 with the exception of our Latin America operations, where revenues were flat. Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 13.7% in 2008 and 16.6% in 2007. Jeanswear operating results included expenses of $27.3 million in 2008 and $8.0 million in 2007 related to capacity reduction and other cost saving actions, which negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 1.0% and 0.3%, respectively. Operating margins in 2008 were also impacted by lower revenues without comparable expense reduction, increased promotional activities and higher product costs. The 2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 0.2% related to the gain on the sale of H.I.S trademarks and related intellectual property during that year. Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.6% in 2007 and 15.5% in 2006. The increase in 2007 operating margins resulted from (i) growth in our international jeans businesses, where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses, (ii) improved operating efficiencies, (iii) a 0.2% increase in 2007 due to the gain on the H.I.S sale and (iv) capacity and other cost reduction actions that negatively impacted margins by 0.3% in 2007 vs. 0.5% in 2006. Imagewear: The Imagewear Coalition includes VFs occupational (industrial, career and safety) apparel business, as well as our licensed sports apparel business. Imagewear Coalition Revenues were flat in both our occupational and licensed sports apparel businesses in 2008 compared with 2007. Imagewear Coalition Revenues increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the Majestic acquisition. Occupational apparel revenues declined 3% in 2007 from 2006. This reduction included the impact of exiting our underperforming commodity fleece and T shirt business. Excluding this business, revenues in our occupational apparel business increased slightly in 2007 over 2006. Revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59% in 2007 over 2006 due to the acquisition of Majestic. This acquisition added $156 million to revenues in 2007. Excluding the impact of the Majestic acquisition, licensed apparel revenues increased 6% in 2007 led by growth in the licensed National Football League and Major League Baseball businesses. Imagewear Coalition operating margins declined in 2008 to 13.3% from 14.4% in 2007, reflecting difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that especially affected consumer spending in our licensed sports apparel businesses. In addition, the 2008 operating results included a $2.0 million charge for cost reduction activities that negatively impacted the operating margin by 0.2% and additional investments in advertising that accounted for 0.4% of the margin decline. Operating margins for the Imagewear Coalition declined to 14.4% in 2007 from 16.2% in 2006, resulting from competitive factors impacting the pricing of new programs within the occupational apparel businesses and the impact of the 2007 Majestic acquisition, which had lower operating margins than Imagewear Coalition averages. Sportswear: The Sportswear Coalition consists of our Nautica lifestyle brand, the John Varvatos luxury collection for men and the Kipling brand business in North America (whereas the Kipling brand is managed as part of the Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition internationally). Coalition Revenues were down 7% in 2008 compared with 2007, with an 11% decrease in our Nautica brand revenues partially offset by double digit revenue gains in our John Varvatos and Kipling brand businesses. The decline in the Nautica business resulted from difficult market conditions in the department store channel, lower volumes in our retail outlet stores and the exit in early 2008 of our womens wholesale business. Coalition Revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with a 4% decrease in our Nautica brand revenues offset by double digit revenue gains in our John Varvatos and Kipling brand businesses. The overall decline in 31 Nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to challenging conditions in department stores and higher promotional activity in our Nautica retail stores in the second half of 2007. Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 6.3% in 2008 from 9.6% in 2007 due to lower Nautica brand revenues without comparable expense reduction and increased markdown activity related to a highly promotional retail environment. In addition, the 2008 operating results included $5.8 million in charges for cost reduction activities, including the exit of the Nautica womens wholesale sportswear business that negatively impacted the operating margin by 0.9%. Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 9.6% in 2007 from 13.3% in 2006 due to the impact of revenue decreases in the Nautica brand without comparable expense reduction and increased promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the department store channel in 2007. Contemporary Brands: This coalition was formed in August 2007 with two newly acquired businesses Seven For All Mankind (7 For All Mankind brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel) and lucy activewear (lucy brand of womens activewear). This coalition in 2008 also includes the earnings since June 2008 from our one third equity investment in Mo Industries, the owner and marketer of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands. VF expects to acquire the remaining two thirds equity interest in Mo Industries in the first half of 2009. The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2008 was due to a full year of ownership of the 7 For All Mankind and lucy brands and additional VF operated retail store openings. The Contemporary Brands Coalition operating margin decreased from 17.5% in 2007 to 13.9% in 2008, reflecting high levels of promotion and markdown related expenses as a result of the significant impact of the economic downturn on the more upscale department stores. In addition, the 2008 operating results included the impact of 1.7% for charges for an unremitted value added tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives. Other: The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business, which is a group of company operated retail outlet stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non VF products (primarily womens intimate apparel, childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic) are reported in this business segment. Revenues in 2008 for the Other business segment were flat with 2007. The increase in revenues in 2007 over 2006 was due to VF Outlets sales of womens intimate apparel products obtained from independent suppliers following VFs exit of its intimate apparel business in April 2007 (whereas such revenues prior to April 2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations). Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes: There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. 32 Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows: 2008 2007 2006 In millions Information systems and shared services $ 178.2 $ 187.0 $ 179.0 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (150.3 ) (146.4 ) (153.0 ) Less billings for transition services after sale of intimate apparel business (13.7 ) 27.9 26.9 26.0 Corporate headquarters costs 79.3 96.4 84.7 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 11.3 10.9 11.3 Other 1.3 6.1 5.8 Corporate and Other Expenses $ 119.8 $ 140.3 $ 127.8 Information Systems and Shared Services Included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2008 resulted primarily from information systems costs incurred in 2007 for transition services provided to the acquirer of our intimate apparel business that did not recur in 2008. The reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007 is separately presented above. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The decrease in corporate headquarters costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from lower management incentive compensation. The increase in these costs from 2006 to 2007 was driven by higher incentive compensation and other costs. Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. Other This category includes (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets Accounts Receivable decreased 12% in 2008 due, in part, to a 5% decrease in fourth quarter wholesale revenues compared with 2007. In addition, collections on accounts receivable were higher in 2008 because that year included 53 weeks; that is, collections in the 53rd week ended January 3, 2009 sharply exceeded credit sales during that week. Inventories increased 1% in 2008, reflecting our aggressive management of inventory levels during the economic downturn. Other Current Assets increased at December 2008 over 2007 due primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008. Property, Plant and Equipment remained flat at the end of 2008 compared with 2007, with additions from 2008 capital spending being offset by depreciation and the effects of foreign currency translation. Capital spending in 2008 supported the growth of our businesses and specifically included an increased level of spending to support new retail stores. 33 Total Intangible Assets and Goodwill decreased in 2008 due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in translating balances of international businesses, partially offset by the acquired Lee Spain balances. Other Assets increased in 2008 as a result of our investment in Mo Industries and higher deferred income taxes. The increase in deferred income taxes primarily related to the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans as discussed below. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the value of our assets held for deferred compensation plans. In October 2007, VF entered into a $1.0 billion domestic senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper. Also in October 2007, certain international subsidiaries, with VF as guarantor, entered into a 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $347.2 million) senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement. There were no Short term Borrowings under these domestic or international credit agreements at December 2008. Short term Borrowings at December 2007 included $92.7 million outstanding under the international credit agreement. Short term Borrowings under other international borrowing agreements were $53.6 million at December 2008 and $38.8 million at December 2007. Accounts Payable decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the timing of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at our fiscal year end. Accrued Liabilities increased in 2008 due to the fourth quarter 2008 charge for cost reduction actions and increased income and other tax accruals, partially offset by lower incentive compensation liabilities. Other Liabilities increased due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2008, as discussed in the following paragraph. This increase is partially offset by lower deferred compensation liabilities and deferred income taxes. The global credit crisis and the related significant declines in global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of our defined benefit pension plans investment portfolio. As a result, our projected pension benefit obligations now exceed the value of our plans investment assets. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, the underfunded status of our pension plans was recognized as a $414.9 million liability at December 2008 and a $291.0 million after tax charge in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Net deferred actuarial losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) will be amortized to pension expense over the next five years. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans. Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: 2008 2007 Dollars in millions Working capital $ 1,640.8 $ 1,510.7 Current ratio 2.6 to 1 2.3 to 1 Debt to total capital 25.2 % 26.4 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders equity. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 18.7% at the end of 2008. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, which was $679.5 million in 2008, $833.6 million in 2007 and $454.1 million in 2006, is primarily dependent on the level of Income from Continuing Operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital components. Income from Continuing Operations was $602.7 million, $613.2 million and $535.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each year included noncash stock based compensation expense of $31.6 million, $62.4 million and $46.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also, we did not make a discretionary contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2007 or 2008 because of the plans funded status at the beginning of each of those years. Operating cash flows in 2006 included a discretionary contribution to the pension plan of $75.0 million. 34 The net change in operating asset and liability components was a cash usage of $152.3 million in 2008, $4.2 million in 2007 and $200.6 million in 2006. Cash flow in 2008 benefited from collections on accounts receivable in the 53rd week of the year; that is, collections in the 53rd week ended January 3, 2009 sharply exceeded credit sales during that week. Cash flow in 2007 benefited because the timing of year end payments resulted in an unusually large accounts payable balance at the end of 2007, which resulted in higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008. Cash generated from operations was lower in 2006 due to (i) higher than normal accounts receivable at the end of 2006, resulting from very strong international sales near the end of the year to customers with longer payment terms, (ii) unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006 due to the timing of inventory receipts and (iii) unusually high accrued income taxes at the beginning of 2006 due to required tax payments for the prior year. To finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates relying on continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2008, $988.4 million was available for borrowing under VFs $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit facility, with $11.6 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. This credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings. Also at the end of 2008, 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $347.2 million) was available for borrowing under VFs senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility. As discussed in the previous Balance Sheets section, our defined benefit pension plans were significantly underfunded at the end of 2008. VF is not required and does not intend to make a funding contribution to the plan during 2009. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and to evaluate future funding levels. We paid cash of $93.4 million, $1,060.6 million and $39.3 million for acquisitions in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies. These acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances, short term commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. In addition, we received $348.7 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business in 2007. Capital expenditures were $124.2 million in 2008, compared with $113.9 million and $127.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail, distribution and information systems, as well as maintenance spending across our global manufacturing network. We expect that capital spending could reach $110 million in 2009. Capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. During 2007, VF received $592.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of $600.0 million principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due in 2017 and 6.45% senior notes due in 2037. VF paid $78.1 million under the international bank credit agreement in 2007 and paid $33.0 million notes in each of 2007 and 2006 related to the Nautica acquisition. See Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2007, Standard Poors Ratings Services affirmed its A minus corporate credit rating, A 2 commercial paper rating and stable outlook for VF. Standard Poors also assigned its A minus senior unsecured debt rating to VFs $600.0 million unsecured senior notes issued in October 2007. In August 2007, Moodys Investors Service affirmed VFs long term debt rating of A3, commercial paper rating of Prime 2 and stable outlook. Existing long term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. During 2008, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a cost of $149.7 million (average price of $74.86). During 2007, VF purchased 4.1 million shares of its Common Stock at a cost of $350.0 million (average price of $85.03), using the proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business. In addition, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock in 2006 at a cost of $118.6 million (average price of $59.29 per share). The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset, on a long term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 3.2 million shares. We do not currently intend to repurchase any shares in 2009. We will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions, our common stock price and levels of stock option exercises. 35 Cash dividends totaled $2.33 per common share in 2008, compared with $2.23 in 2007 and $1.94 in 2006. Our dividend payout rate was 43.0% in 2008, compared with payout rates of 42.7% in 2007 and 41.1% in 2006. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2009 is $2.36 per share. Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2008 that will require the use of funds: Payments Due or Forecasted by Period Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter In millions Recorded liabilities: Long term debt(1) $ 1,145 $ 3 $ 203 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 930 Other(2) 472 137 69 34 39 32 161 Unrecorded commitments: Interest payment obligations(3) 1,285 75 71 58 58 57 966 Operating leases(4) 844 170 148 128 99 84 215 Minimum royalty payments(5) 397 59 80 78 78 50 52 Inventory obligations(6) 748 685 15 15 15 15 3 Other obligations(7) 58 40 12 5 1 Total $ 4,949 $ 1,169 $ 598 $ 321 $ 293 $ 241 $ 2,327 (1) Long term debt, including the current portion, consists of required principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for other noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet. Payments for deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. (3) Interest payment obligations represent (i) required interest payments on long term debt, (ii) the interest portion of payments on capital leases and (iii) accretion of debt discount (in the Thereafter column) on the $300.0 million principal amount of notes. Amounts exclude bank fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain that would be included in Interest Expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance. Such costs, which are not included above, average approximately 27% of the stated minimum lease payments. Total lease commitments exclude $11.3 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases. (5) Minimum royalty payments include required minimum advertising commitments under license agreements. (6) Inventory purchase obligations represent binding commitments for finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. Included is a remaining commitment at fair value to purchase $77.5 million of finished goods from one supplier, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year. The reported amount excludes inventory purchase liabilities included in Accounts Payable at December 2008. (7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. We have other financial commitments at the end of 2008 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: Funding contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan are not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether or when further contributions will be required. VF owned one third of the equity of Mo Industries at the end of 2008 and had an option to acquire the remaining equity. VF expects to acquire the remaining two thirds of the outstanding equity of Mo Industries for approximately $200 million, including the repayment of debt, in the first half of 2009. 36 VF has entered into $80.3 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims obligations. Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments are not included in the table. During 2008 VF met its obligations when due from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) issuance of commercial paper and (iii) on a limited basis, short term borrowings under international bank facilities. Credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the United States and global capital markets during 2008, particularly during the last half of the year, had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period, although for generally shorter maturities and at higher spreads over U.S. Treasury interest rates than in prior years. If the commercial paper markets were not available, VF has $1.3 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international committed revolving bank credit agreements. These agreements expire in 2012. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business, and we regularly assess these potential risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within VF or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate or other financial asset or index. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. VF had $381.8 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2008. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase. These investments consist of deposits in highly rated U.S. and foreign commercial banks and investments in institutional money market funds that invest only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Considering recent credit market conditions and the weakened financial condition of many banks and other financial institutions, we continually monitor VFs cash equivalents and the credit ratings of VFs financial institutions. Similarly, we monitor the credit quality of investments in our defined benefit pension plan to ensure that the plans exposure to investments affected, or likely to be affected, by the credit market crisis is not significant. We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since all of our long term debt has fixed interest rates, our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short term borrowings, which averaged approximately $308 million during 2008. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents. Based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash equivalents during 2008, the effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates on reported net income would not be significant. VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2008 were generated in international markets. Substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2007, we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for euro denominated borrowings. Although there were no borrowings under this agreement at the end of 2008, borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our euro denominated net assets. Net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe, Latin American and Asia, are considered to be long term, and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 37 (Loss) in Common Stockholders Equity. We do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar. We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for specific foreign currency transactions or a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on VFs cash flows, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions or cash flows being hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows anticipated during the following 12 months (relating to cross border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Although VF is exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts, we believe these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions. We continually monitor our hedging positions with each counterparty and the credit ratings of the counterparties. We will adjust our positions if necessary. If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2008, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $45 million. Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or anticipated cash flows being hedged. VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which indirectly impacts fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance. VF has not historically managed, nor do we currently intend to manage, commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside specialists to assist in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business acquisition, impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self insured liabilities. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 38 Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style size color stockkeeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving or excess quantities, we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. Long lived Assets We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective, as the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of future cash flows. We use the same assumptions of future cash flows for assigning fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition. Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and our amortization policies for definite lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets. In evaluating the useful lives and expected benefits to be received for customer related intangible assets, we review historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license related intangible assets, we review historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods and attrition rates. We review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. In those circumstances, we measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. This review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if any, attributable to the assets being tested. We evaluate indefinite lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We measure recoverability of an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset by comparing its fair value, estimated using the relief from royalty method, with its carrying value. Under the relief from royalty method, forecasted global revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark from an independent party. Those forecasted royalties are discounted to a present value, and the discounted fair value is compared with the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset. The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill of an acquired business is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the business unit, including recorded goodwill, to the fair value of the business unit. Fair value is estimated using forecasted cash flows of a business unit, discounted to a present value. These assessments of intangible asset and goodwill fair values require managements assumptions and judgment regarding business strategies, future revenues and profitability, working capital changes, capital spending, income tax rates and a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in the forecasted cash flows. Based on our evaluations, other than the charges in 2006 and 2007 in connection with the sale of our intimate apparel businesses, the indicated fair values of our amortized assets, indefinite lived trademark assets and goodwill exceeded the respective carrying amounts of those assets in each of the last three years, and accordingly no 39 impairment charges were recognized. If the estimated fair value of an acquired business were to decline due to changes in forecasted business operations, or if we were to decide to discontinue use of its trademark or otherwise exit the business, we may be exposed to an impairment charge, which could be material. Stock Options We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in each valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise. In each year, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In each year, we based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near the money options on VF Common Stock. We measured historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term. Pension Obligations VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or before December 31, 2004. For employees covered by this plan, VF also sponsors an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax regulations. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. We annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement, termination, disability and mortality. We believe our assumptions are reflective of the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations at each measurement date. The discount rate reflects the interest rate inherent in the price that VF could settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. Our discount rate assumption at each year end is based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to be made to participants in our pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service (over 300 such bonds with at least $50 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputtable unless with make whole provisions) and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans distinct liability characteristics. Despite the unusual conditions prevailing in the corporate bond markets in late 2008, we concluded that those Aa rated issues meet the high quality intent of the applicable accounting standards. We believe our 2008 discount rate of 6.50% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans. The discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans longer duration of expected 40 benefit payments due to (i) a higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and (ii) a higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investment assets in our qualified plans pension trust. Our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk. Plan assets are comprised of a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income and real estate securities. We develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on several factors, including the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The weighted average of the projected long term rate of return for the various classes of assets held by the plan provides the basis for the expected long term rate of return actuarial assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 8.00% in 2008 and 8.25% in 2007 and 2006. Our actual compounded annual rate of return since 1981 has exceeded 9%, although our actual rate of return was lower than the 8.00% assumption for the trailing 10 and 15 year periods and was negative in 2008. We will constantly challenge the plans asset allocation, giving consideration to changes that will appropriately balance anticipated investment returns with risk. The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans projected benefit obligations, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Projected Pension Expense Benefit Obligations Dollars in millions 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 1 $ 71 0.50% increase in discount rate (1 ) (66 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 5 0.50% increase in expected investment return (5 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (1 ) (3 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 1 3 During 2007 and 2006, actual pension plan investment returns varied favorably compared with their respective actuarial assumptions. In 2008, however, there was a significant decline in the market value of our pension plan investment assets due to the global credit and financial market crisis, resulting in over $450 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses at the end of 2008. Accordingly, our qualified defined benefit pension plan was significantly underfunded at the end of 2008. The underfunded status of our pension plans at the end of 2008 resulted in recognition of a $291.0 million after tax charge in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), along with recognition of related current and noncurrent liabilities of $9.4 million and $405.5 million, respectively. The funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance, changes in interest rates and the level of VF contributions to the qualified plan. Differences between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains and losses related to investment returns, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect the current years pension expense but instead are deferred and amortized to pension expense over future periods. Our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows: amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of investment assets or projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are not amortized; amounts totaling 10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants; and amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years. The cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees (commonly called service cost) was $16.5 million in 2008 and has averaged $20.1 million per year over the last three years. Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was $10.8 million in 2008, $13.1 million in 2007 and $37.5 million in 2006. Expense in 2006 was significantly higher than the average annual service cost because that year included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Our pension expense for 2008 and 2007 decreased significantly from 2006 due to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, higher investment returns on a larger amount of plan assets (arising from discretionary funding contributions totaling $260.0 million over the period 2003 2006) and an increase in the discount 41 rate used to value our projected benefit liabilities. Because of the significant investment losses incurred in the plans investment portfolio in 2008, pension expense for 2009 will include a significant cost component for amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses. This significant amortization cost component, plus expected reduced investment portfolio earnings due to a lower amount of plan assets, will cause our pension expense to increase to approximately $98 million for 2009 from $10.8 million in 2008. VF is not required under applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2009 but does intend to make contributions totaling $9.4 million during 2009 to fund payments under the supplemental pension plan. We believe that VF has sufficient liquidity to make contributions to the qualified plan, as necessary, in future years to return the plan to a fully or substantially fully funded status. Effective December 31, 2004, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the plans to new entrants. The amendments did not affect the benefits of plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after that date, plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate in a new defined contribution arrangement with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as directed by the participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our total retirement benefit expense over the last three years. However, on a longer term basis, the service cost component of our defined benefit plans expense is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense, and the year to year variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease. Income Taxes As a global company, VF is subject to income tax and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment. VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential issues under the more likely than not standard of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established, or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than established accruals. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. We have recorded $133.2 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and we have recorded $93.4 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period. We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that period. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that 42 forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1.A of this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. A discussion of VFs market risks is incorporated by reference to Risk Management in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report.
