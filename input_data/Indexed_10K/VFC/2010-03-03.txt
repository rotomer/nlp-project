Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle and other apparel products. Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus VF operated retail stores and internet websites. VFs businesses are grouped into five product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of businesses are referred to as coalitions. Both management and VFs Board of Directors evaluate operating performance at the coalition level, which is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation. These coalitions represent VFs reportable segments. These groupings of businesses are summarized as follows: Coalition Principal VF owned Brands Outdoor Action Sports The North Face, Vans, JanSport, Eastpak, Kipling (except in North America), Napapijri, Reef, Eagle Creek Jeanswear Wrangler, Wrangler Hero, Lee, Riders, Rustler, Timber Creek by Wrangler Imagewear Red Kap, Bulwark, Majestic Sportswear Nautica, Kipling (in North America) Contemporary Brands 7 For All Mankind, John Varvatos, Splendid, Ella Moss, lucy Impact of the Current Global Economic Environment The global recession that began near the end of 2007 is the longest and most severe recession in the last several decades. This recession, which has resulted in flat to falling consumer income levels, sharp declines in real estate and global securities markets, volatility in commodity and currency markets, significant increases in unemployment, numerous retailer and other bankruptcies, and unprecedented government stimulus programs, has led to a decline in consumer spending that has impacted VF as well as most other companies. Recent statistics indicate that the U.S. and global economies are showing some signs of stability, but unemployment is still very high and consumer spending remains weak. 27 Consumer spending represents about 70% of the domestic economy, and spending at retail represents about one half of that. The general reduction in household wealth and income over the last two years, along with reduced availability of consumer credit and increased savings and debt repayment rates, has reduced consumer purchases of discretionary items such as apparel. Reduced consumer spending has had a significant impact on sales in all retail channels, and particularly in sales of premium, higher priced products in the upper tier distribution channels. Although there are some signs of stabilization, consumer confidence remains weak. We believe economic conditions will remain difficult and that consumer spending will remain constrained in global markets through 2010. In response to these market conditions, VF was aggressive in reducing costs and lowering inventory levels during 2009. However, we have continued to invest in our brands and, in 2010, are expecting to increase our investments in advertising, product development and retail store expansion. These investments, totaling $50 million, will be very targeted and concentrated in those businesses with the strongest opportunities for growth, including The North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind brands, and our business in Asia. A portion of these investments will be targeted at further strengthening our product innovation and sustainability platforms. We believe that the strength of our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic climate. Long term Financial Targets While our long term revenue and earnings growth targets, as described below, were not achieved in 2009 due to global recessionary conditions and are not expected to be achieved in 2010, our long term targets remain intact. These targets are summarized below: Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year Our long term revenue growth target is 8% to 10% per year, with approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic growth and 2% to 3% from acquisitions. We met this long term target by achieving revenue growth of 16% in 2007. However, our revenues increased by 6% in 2008 and declined by 6% in 2009, reflecting the impact of the global economic environment discussed above. Key drivers of future growth, consistent with the 8% to 10% long term target, include growth in our lifestyle brands, acquisitions of additional lifestyle brands, international expansion and continued growth in our direct to consumer business. We now expect our international revenues to grow to 40% of Total Revenues, compared with a prior long term target of 33%. International revenues accounted for 30% of our Total Revenues in 2008 and 2009. In addition, we continue to expect our direct to consumer business to grow to a level that exceeds 20% of Total Revenues through an increase in sales within existing stores, new store openings and expansion of our e commerce platforms. Direct to consumer revenues comprised 16% of our Total Revenues in 2008 and 17% in 2009. We have many programs in place to continue to drive organic growth, including a plan to invest $50 million behind our strongest brands in 2010, and will continue our aggressive search to acquire branded lifestyle businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals. Operating income of 15% of revenues Operating margins of 12.3% in 2008 and of 11.9% in 2009 (excluding the effect of the impairment charge discussed in the Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations section below) were negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. In addition, operating margins in 2008 included the negative impact from nonrecurring charges related to cost saving actions taken near the end of that year, and in 2009 included a significant increase in expense for our defined benefit pension plans. We expect to improve our operating margin as we (i) achieve disproportionate growth in our higher margin, faster growing lifestyle businesses, (ii) grow our international and retail businesses, which also have higher operating margins than VF averages, and (iii) continue our relentless focus on cost reduction. Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year While we have exceeded this target in recent years, we did not meet this long term target in 2008 and 2009 due to the negative impact of the factors discussed above. We expect to increase earnings per share by 9% to 11% in 2010. 28 Return on invested capital of 17% We believe that a high return on capital is closely correlated with enhancing total shareholder return. We calculate return on invested capital as follows: Income before net interest expense, after income taxes Average stockholders equity, plus average short and long term debt Excluding the effect of the impairment charge discussed in the Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations section below, we earned a 12.6% return on invested capital in 2009, compared with a 13.5% return in 2008. Our returns in these years were negatively impacted by the global economic conditions discussed above, our 2008 cost reduction initiatives, our incremental pension expense in 2009 and by our 2007 acquisitions. Newly acquired businesses generally have a lower than average return on invested capital in their earlier years of ownership. We expect our return on invested capital to improve in 2010 and move closer to the long term target of 17%. Debt to capital of less than 40% We have established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our stockholders equity, plus combined short and long term debt. This ratio was 23.7% at the end of 2009. If cash were netted, the ratio would have been 10.7%. This low debt to capital ratio demonstrates VFs ability to navigate effectively through a difficult economic environment and maintain financial strength. Dividend payout ratio of 40% Our target is to return approximately 40% of earnings to our stockholders through dividends. The 2009 dividend payout ratio was 46.0% of diluted earnings per share (excluding the effect of the impairment charge discussed in the Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations section below). Our industry leading dividend payout is expected to exceed 40% of earnings per share in 2010. Strategic Objectives Our strategy for growth consists of six drivers: 1. Build more global, growing lifestyle brands. Focus on building more global, growing lifestyle brands with an emphasis on activity based brands. 2. Expand our share with winning customers. Develop brand and product strategies that will enable us to gain market share with successful, growing retail partners. 3. Stretch brands and customers to new geographies. Grow our international presence, particularly in China, Europe, India and Brazil. 4. Expand our direct to consumer business. Increase the portion of revenues obtained from VF operated monobrand retail stores and e commerce. 5. Fuel the growth. Maintain our competitive advantage by leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF to drive lower costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate acquisitions efficiently to generate savings that can be reinvested in our brands. 6. Build new growth enablers. Support our growth plans by identifying and developing high potential employees and by building a diverse team of talented leaders with specific focus on consumer insight and innovation. Highlights of 2009 There were several notable actions and achievements in 2009: We continued our positive momentum in the Outdoor Action Sports businesses and achieved record revenue and operating margin levels. We gained market share in the United States in our core Wrangler and Lee brands in a very difficult economic environment. Our Asia revenues increased 28%. 29 We completed the acquisition of Mo Industries Holdings, Inc. (Mo Industries), a Los Angeles based company that owns the Splendid and Ella Moss brands of premium sportswear marketed to upscale department and specialty stores. Our direct to consumer business revenues grew to 17% of Total Revenues and we opened 90 stores. Gross margin was at a record level of 44.3%. We improved the profitability of our Sportswear businesses, achieving double digit operating margin. We reduced inventories by 17%, reflecting our aggressive management of inventory levels during the economic downturn. Our record $973 million of cash flow from operating activities allowed us to grow existing cash, while funding (i) $298 million of investments in capital expenditures and acquisitions, (ii) $262 million of dividends, (iii) over $200 million in contributions to our pension plans and (iv) $112 million of repurchases of our Common Stock. We ended the year with $732 million of cash and equivalents, almost doubling our prior year position. And with our A minus investment grade credit rating, we continue to have access to capital markets and have the ability to borrow over $1.3 billion under committed bank credit agreements. We increased our dividends paid per share for the 37th consecutive year. Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues during the last two years: 2009 2008 Compared with Compared with 2008 2007 In millions Total revenues prior year $ 7,643 $ 7,219 Impact of foreign currency translation (156 ) 109 Organic growth (decline) (344 ) 11 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 16 291 Acquisition in current year 61 13 Total revenues current year $ 7,220 $ 7,643 Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues declined 6% in 2009, with 2% of the decline due to foreign currency translation. The effect of global recessionary conditions on consumer spending affected all of our businesses in 2009. In spite of the recession, we reported growth in our Outdoor Action Sports businesses in 2009. Revenues increased in 2008 due to overall unit volume increases and organic growth in our Outdoor Action Sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of operations of our Contemporary Brands businesses acquired in 2007. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro countries) negatively impacted revenue by $156 million in 2009 relative to 2008. A weaker U.S. dollar benefited revenues by $109 million in 2008 relative to 2007. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was $1.39 per euro during 2009, compared with $1.47 during 2008 and $1.36 during 2007. 30 The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of Income: 2009 2008 2007 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 44.3 % 43.9 % 43.5 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 32.4 31.7 30.1 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 1.7 Operating income 10.2 % 12.3 % 13.4 % Gross margins increased 1.4% in 2009 over 2008 and 1.0% in 2008 over 2007 from the impact of our direct to consumer operations, which have gross margin percentages higher than VF averages. In addition, our aggressive management of inventory levels in 2009 resulted in gross margin improvement due to a lower impact from the disposal of excess and obsolete inventory. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower gross margins in our European jeanswear and imagewear businesses. The 2008 increase was partially offset by lower gross margins primarily in our European jeanswear business. See the Information by Business Segment section below. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues increased 1.2% in 2009 over 2008 due to the higher expense of our defined benefit pension plans and 1.1% due to growth in our direct to consumer business, which has a higher expense ratio than our wholesale business. The 2009 comparison benefited from (i) the absence of nonrecurring charges from cost reduction actions, which increased Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues by 0.7% in 2008, and (ii) the benefit of these actions and other spending reductions in 2009. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues increased 1.4% in 2008 over 2007 due to the growth in our direct to consumer business and 0.7% due to nonrecurring charges from the cost reduction actions mentioned above. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other spending reductions in 2008. We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores, and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some apparel companies classify cooperative advertising costs as a reduction of Net Sales and licensing costs as a reduction to Royalty Income. Further, some classify retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margin and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies. We completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2009. Based on our assessment of current and expected future economic conditions, trends and forecasted cash flows at each business unit, and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing our business units, VF management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its Reef, Nautica, and lucy business units exceeded their fair values and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at its Reef and lucy business units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, VF recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $122.0 million ($114.4 million net of related income tax benefits) to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and trademark intangible assets of these business units to their fair values. Of this total, Reef represented $36.7 million, Nautica represented $58.5 million, and lucy represented $26.8 million (in each case, 23%, 14% and 26% of its combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible assets). For additional information, see Notes H and U to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below. References to financial results excluding the impact of the impairment charge reflect non GAAP measures and are addressed below in the Non GAAP Financial Information section. Interest income decreased $3.9 million in 2009 and $3.2 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense (including bank fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain) decreased $8.1 million in 2009 due to reduced short term borrowing levels and lower interest rates. Interest expense increased $21.9 million in 2008 due to an increase in debt related to the issuance of $600.0 million of senior long term notes in October 2007 to fund our 2007 acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by lower short term borrowing rates. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled approximately $1,364 million for 2009, $1,454 million for 2008 and 31 $1,080 million for 2007. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.1% for 2009, 6.3% for 2008 and 6.4% for 2007. The effective income tax rate was 29.9% in 2009 and 26.2% excluding the impairment charge discussed above. These rates compared with 28.9% in 2008 and 32.3% in 2007. During 2009, we recorded tax benefits of $17.5 million related to favorable outcomes of U.S. state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several U.S. state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded. These items lowered our 2009 annual tax rate by 2.7%. During 2008, we recorded tax benefits of $24.6 million related primarily to favorable outcomes of foreign tax audits, expirations of statutes of limitations in foreign jurisdictions and other state tax benefits that lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 2.9%. In addition, during 2008, we recorded tax benefits of $11.5 million to reflect updated assessments of previously accrued amounts, which lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 1.4%. During 2007, we recorded tax benefits of $12.0 million related primarily to expirations of statutes of limitations in several international jurisdictions that lowered our 2007 annual tax rate by 1.3%. The remaining declines in the effective income tax rate in 2009 (excluding the impairment charge) from 2008 and in 2008 from 2007 were primarily attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than the United States. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased to $461.3 million in 2009 from $602.7 million in 2008, while earnings per share decreased to $4.13 in 2009 from $5.42 in 2008. (All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.) Earnings per share in 2009 were $5.16 excluding a $1.03 impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets. Earnings per share in 2009 were also negatively impacted by (i) incremental pension expense in our defined benefit pension plans of $0.48 over the 2008 level and (ii) an unfavorable impact of $0.18, compared with 2008, from translating foreign currencies into a stronger U.S. dollar. Earnings per share in 2009 benefited from the absence of nonrecurring charges of $0.30 per share for cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased 2% to $602.7 million in 2008 from $613.2 million in 2007, while earnings per share increased to $5.42 in 2008 from $5.41 in 2007. Cost reduction actions taken during the fourth quarter of 2008 lowered earnings per share by $0.30. Cost reduction actions completed in 2007, partially offset by the gain on exiting the H.I.S business, reduced 2007 earnings per share by $0.06. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.15 favorable impact on earnings per share in 2008 compared with 2007. Discrete tax items accounted for an incremental benefit of $0.16 in 2008 earnings per share over 2007. Earnings per share increased slightly in 2008 on lower Income from Continuing Operations due to the reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008. Information by Business Segment For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition, along with its share of centralized corporate expenses directly related to the coalition and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the coalitions, impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets, net interest expense and a significant portion of our pension expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. To leverage the scale of VF, there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions. Accordingly, coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VFs presentation of Coalition Profit may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies. 32 The following tables present a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues and Coalition Profit by coalition during the last two years: Outdoor Action Contemporary Sports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other In millions Coalition Revenues 2007 $ 2,387 $ 2,897 $ 988 $ 631 $ 195 $ 121 Impact of foreign currency translation 59 50 Organic growth (decline) 282 (195 ) (30 ) (60 ) 12 2 Acquisitions in prior year 14 33 244 Acquisition in current year 13 Coalition Revenues 2008 2,742 2,765 991 571 451 123 Impact of foreign currency translation (76 ) (77 ) (3 ) Organic growth (decline) 86 (182 ) (126 ) (73 ) (37 ) (12 ) Acquisition in prior year 16 Acquisition in current year 61 Coalition Revenues 2009 $ 2,752 $ 2,522 $ 865 $ 498 $ 472 $ 111 Outdoor Action Contemporary Sports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other In millions Coalition Profit 2007 $ 393 $ 479 $ 142 $ 67 $ 24 $ 4 Impact of foreign currency translation 9 10 Operations 52 (110 ) (10 ) (25 ) 28 (7 ) Coalition Profit 2008 454 379 132 42 52 (3 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (16 ) (8 ) (2 ) 1 Operations 70 (1 ) (45 ) 10 (13 ) 4 Coalition Profit 2009 $ 508 $ 370 $ 87 $ 52 $ 37 $ 2 Operating results of the John Varvatos business unit for 2007 and 2008 have been reclassified from the Sportswear Coalition to the Contemporary Brands Coalition reflecting the change in internal management responsibility, which began in 2009. Outdoor Action Sports: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Coalition Revenues $ 2,752.0 $ 2,742.1 $ 2,387.1 0.4 % 14.9 % Coalition Profit 508.3 454.2 392.7 11.9 % 15.7 % Operating Margin 18.5 % 16.6 % 16.4 % The Outdoor Action Sports Coalition consists of VFs outdoor and action sports related businesses including The North Face brand apparel, footwear and equipment, Vans performance and casual footwear and apparel, JanSport and Eastpak daypacks and apparel, Kipling bags and accessories, Napapijri outdoor based sportswear, Reef beach inspired footwear and apparel and Eagle Creek adventure travel gear. 33 Coalition Revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported basis compared with 2008 and 3% on a constant currency basis. Reported global revenues of the two largest brands in this coalition increased in 2009 The North Face by 6% (including a negative impact of 3% from foreign currency translation) and Vans by 5% (including a negative impact of 2% from foreign currency translation). In addition, revenues in Asia increased by more than 50%, largely due to increases in the Vans brand, which was just introduced into China in 2008. These increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue declines in the other coalition businesses. Coalition Revenues increased in 2008 led by global unit gains from strong consumer demand for our The North Face, Vans, Kipling, Napapijri and Eastpak brands. Growth in these brands, particularly The North Face and Vans, included geographic expansion and the opening of additional owned retail locations. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports businesses increased 11%, while international revenues increased 21% with the favorable effects of foreign currency accounting for 6% of this increase. Approximately one half of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 resulted from increased gross margins in our outdoor and action sports businesses, with their direct to consumer revenues making up a larger portion of total Coalition Revenues in 2009. In addition, the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 0.3% from an $8.3 million nonrecurring charge in 2008 related to cost reduction actions. The remainder of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 was due to lower spending, partially offset by continued investments to expand the direct to consumer business. The increase in operating margin in 2008 over 2007 was driven by higher revenues, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses, and growth in our international and direct to consumer operations, where operating margins are higher. These improvements were partially offset by the charge related to cost reduction actions mentioned above. Jeanswear: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Coalition Revenues $ 2,522.5 $ 2,764.9 $ 2,896.7 (8.8 )% (4.6 )% Coalition Profit 370.2 378.9 479.4 (2.3 )% (21.0 )% Operating Margin 14.7 % 13.7 % 16.6 % The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler and Lee brands. Domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4% in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to a difficult retail environment, including the loss of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and a reduction in noncore Riders brand plus size and seasonal programs. Despite these reductions, we believe that we are gaining market share in our Wrangler mens, Lee mens and womens, and core Riders womens businesses, driven by the success of new product innovation. Domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8% in 2008 from 2007 due to a very difficult retail environment caused by the deteriorating global economy that impacted the Lee, mass market and western specialty businesses. Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, declined 18% in 2009 from 2008, with 8% of the decline resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The remainder of the decline was driven by recessionary conditions, especially in Europe, and the decision earlier in 2009 to exit our mass market jeans business in Europe. These declines were partially offset by a 14% increase in jeanswear revenues in Asia. Jeanswear revenues in international markets increased 2% in 2008 over 2007. Foreign currency translation positively impacted international jeanswear 2008 revenues by 5%. Therefore, revenues on a constant currency basis were down in 2008, reflecting difficult economic conditions in key European countries and the sale of the H.I.S business in 2007, which accounted for $25 million of revenues in that year. These declines were partially offset by revenue growth in our Asia business. 34 The Jeanswear operating margin comparison in 2009 benefited by 1.0% from nonrecurring charges in 2008 of $27.3 million related to cost reduction actions. The negative impact of higher distressed inventory provisions in our European businesses in 2009 was offset by lower spending across the coalition due in part to the cost reduction actions taken in 2008. Jeanswear operating margin in 2008 was negatively impacted compared with 2007 due to the charges in 2008 discussed above, lower revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio, increased promotional activities and higher product costs. The 2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 0.2% related to the gain on the sale of H.I.S trademarks and related intellectual property during that year. Imagewear: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Coalition Revenues $ 865.5 $ 991.1 $ 988.3 (12.7 )% 0.3 % Coalition Profit 87.5 131.6 141.9 (33.5 )% (7.2 )% Operating Margin 10.1 % 13.3 % 14.4 % The Imagewear Coalition consists of VFs Image division (occupational apparel and uniforms) and the Licensed Sports division (owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel). Image apparel revenues declined 17% in 2009 from 2008 due to rising unemployment, particularly in the manufacturing and petrochemical sectors. Licensed Sports revenues were down 8% in 2009 from 2008, resulting from lower attendance at sporting events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products. Coalition Revenues were flat in both our Image and Licensed Sports divisions in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty agreements in our Licensed Sports division. The operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflected difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that especially affected consumer spending in our Licensed Sports division. In addition, the 2008 operating results included a $2.0 million nonrecurring charge for cost reduction activities that negatively impacted the operating margin by 0.2% and additional investments in advertising that accounted for 0.4% of the margin decline. Sportswear: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Coalition Revenues $ 498.3 $ 570.7 $ 631.2 (12.7 )% (9.6 )% Coalition Profit 52.0 41.6 66.8 25.0 % (37.8 )% Operating Margin 10.4 % 7.3 % 10.6 % The Sportswear Coalition consists of our Nautica lifestyle brand and the Kipling brand business in North America (whereas the Kipling brand is managed as part of the Outdoor Action Sports Coalition outside North America). The decline in Coalition Revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven by a 13% decrease in Nautica brand revenues. The decline in the Nautica business resulted from difficult market conditions in the department store channel and lower volume in our retail outlet stores. Coalition Revenues were down 7% in 2008 compared with 2007, with an 11% decrease in our Nautica brand revenues partially offset by a double digit revenue gain in our Kipling brand businesses. The decline in the Nautica business resulted from the very challenging department and outlet store trends mentioned above and the exit in early 2008 of our womens wholesale business. 35 Sportswear Coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from 2008 due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in our Nautica business. Also, the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 1.0% from $5.8 million in nonrecurring charges in 2008 related to cost reduction actions, including the exit of the Nautica womens wholesale sportswear business. Sportswear Coalition operating margin declined in 2008 from 2007 due to lower Nautica brand revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and increased markdown activity related to a highly promotional retail environment. In addition, as mentioned above, the 2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted the operating margin by 1.0%. Contemporary Brands: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Coalition Revenues $ 471.9 $ 451.2 $ 194.7 4.6 % 131.7 % Coalition Profit 37.2 51.8 24.0 (28.2 )% 115.9 % Operating Margin 7.9 % 11.5 % 12.3 % This coalition consists of the 7 For All Mankind brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel, John Varvatos luxury apparel collection for men and lucy brand of womens activewear. This coalition also includes the operating results of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands comprised of the earnings from our one third equity investment from June 2008 through March 2009, when the remaining two thirds equity interest was purchased, and the consolidated operating results thereafter. The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2009 was driven by the acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands in March 2009. This increase was partially offset by an 8% decline in our global 7 For All Mankind brand revenues, driven by challenging conditions in the U.S. upper tier department and specialty store channel. We did experience growth in both the 7 For All Mankind Asia business, where revenues nearly doubled, and the direct to consumer business, where revenues more than tripled. We continued to expand this brands reach with 21 retail store openings in 2009. The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2008 was due to a full year of ownership of the 7 For All Mankind and lucy brands. Operating margin was negatively impacted in 2009 compared with 2008 due to volume declines in our 7 For All Mankind wholesale business that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio, increased retail investments across the coalition and higher operating losses in our lucy and John Varvatos businesses. The 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 1.5% from nonrecurring charges in 2008 related to an unremitted value added tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives. Operating margins for our 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands in 2009 were above the coalition average at 16% and 20%, respectively. The operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflects high levels of promotion and markdown related expenses as a result of the significant impact of the economic downturn on the more upscale department stores. In addition, as mentioned above, the 2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges that negatively impacted operating margin by 1.5%. Other: Percent Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Revenues $ 110.2 $ 122.7 $ 121.3 (10.2 )% 1.1 % Profit 1.2 (2.4 ) 4.0 N/A N/A Operating Margin 1.1 % (2.0 )% 3.3 % 36 The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business, which is a group of VF operated retail outlet stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non VF products (primarily womens intimate apparel, childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic) are reported in this business segment. Revenues in the Other business segment declined in 2009 due to the impact of the economic recession on consumer spending. Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes: There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks, Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks was discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. These charges resulted from our annual impairment review of these assets. Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows: 2009 2008 2007 In millions Information systems and shared services $ 164.7 $ 178.2 $ 187.0 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (143.7 ) (150.3 ) (146.4 ) Less billings for transition services after sale of intimate apparel business (13.7 ) 21.0 27.9 26.9 Corporate headquarters costs 72.6 79.3 96.4 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 11.1 11.3 10.9 Other 91.3 1.3 6.1 Corporate and Other Expenses $ 196.0 $ 119.8 $ 140.3 Information Systems and Shared Services Included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2009 from 2008 is primarily due to reductions in third party data center charges and common systems amortization. The decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from information systems costs incurred in 2007 for transition services provided to the acquirer of our intimate apparel business that did not recur in 2008. The reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007 is separately presented above. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The decline in corporate headquarters costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced spending as part of our cost reduction efforts. The decrease in corporate headquarters costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from lower management incentive compensation. 37 Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. Other This category includes (i) costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting, (ii) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments. The most significant of these other adjustments is related to the expense of our centrally managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Coalition Profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense. Pension costs totaling $83.1 million for 2009, primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses, were recorded in other expense. These costs were not significant in prior years. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets Accounts Receivable decreased 9% in 2009 due to the sale of $74.2 million of selected accounts receivable, as discussed in the Liquidity and Cash Flows section below. Inventories declined 17% in 2009, reflecting our aggressive management of inventory levels during the economic downturn. Other Current Assets decreased at December 2009 from 2008 due primarily to a decrease in prepaid income taxes. Property, Plant and Equipment was lower at the end of 2009 compared with 2008 as depreciation expense exceeded our capital spending in 2009. Intangible Assets increased in 2009 due to the Mo Industries acquisition in March 2009, partially offset by the impairment charge and amortization. Goodwill increased in 2009 due to the Mo Industries acquisition in March 2009, partially offset by the impairment charge. Other Assets decreased at December 2009 due to (i) the completion of the acquisition of Mo Industries in March 2009, resulting in the elimination of the $80.5 million equity investment in one third of its stock, and (ii) a reduction in deferred income tax assets. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the investment securities held for VFs deferred compensation plans. VF has a $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed domestic revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper and a 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $358.3 million) senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit agreement. There were no borrowings under these credit agreements at December 2009 or December 2008. Short term Borrowings under other international borrowing agreements were $45.5 million at December 2009 and $53.6 million at December 2008. The decline in Accounts Payable from 2008 to 2009 is consistent with the decline in inventories discussed above. Accrued Liabilities decreased in 2009 due primarily to the payments of the obligations associated with the cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total Long term Debt at December 2009 and December 2008 was comparable. At September 2009, $200.0 million of notes, due October 1, 2010, were reclassified to Current Portion of Long term Debt. Other Liabilities decreased due to the reduction in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2009, as discussed in the following paragraph. This decrease is partially offset by higher deferred income taxes and deferred compensation liabilities. The global credit crisis and the related significant declines in global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of the investment portfolios of our defined benefit pension plans. As a result, our defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status, with our projected pension benefit obligations exceeding 38 the value of our plans investment assets. In December 2008, the underfunded status of $414.9 million was recognized as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. To improve the funded status of our pension plans, we contributed over $200 million to these plans during 2009. Accordingly, the plans underfunded status recognized in our 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet was reduced to $250.9 million. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans. Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: 2009 2008 Dollars in millions Working capital $ 1,536.8 $ 1,640.8 Current ratio 2.4 to 1 2.6 to 1 Debt to total capital 23.7 % 25.2 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders equity. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 10.7% at the end of 2009. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash generated from operations, which was $973.5 million in 2009, $679.5 million in 2008 and $833.6 million in 2007, is primarily dependent on the level of Net Income, changes in accounts receivable, investments in inventories and other working capital components. Net Income was $458.5 million, $602.8 million, and $592.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in Net Income in 2009 was primarily due to a noncash pretax impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets of $122.0 million. Operating cash flow for 2009 included $200.0 million of discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. There were no contributions to this plan in 2007 or 2008 because of the funded status of the plan at the beginning of each of those years. Although VF is not required and does not currently intend to make a funding contribution to the domestic qualified plan during 2010, management is committed to returning each of our defined benefit plans to a fully funded status. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements. The net change in operating asset and liability components provided an increase to operating cash flow of $228.1 million in 2009, in contrast to reducing operating cash flows by $150.6 million in 2008 and $12.5 million in 2007. The positive cash generation from these components in 2009 was driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels and the sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below. The changes in operating cash flow from other current assets resulted from an unusually high amount of prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008 benefited from an additional week of collections on accounts receivable in the 53rd week of the fiscal year; that is, collections sharply exceeded credit sales in the additional week. Operating cash flow in 2007 benefited from an unusually high accounts payable balance at the end of 2007, related to the timing of payments, that resulted in higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008. During September 2009, VF entered into an agreement to sell selected trade accounts receivable, on a revolving basis, to a financial institution. This agreement covers the sale of up to $105.0 million of accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis. Net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as part of the accounts receivable component of cash from operations. The December 2009 balance of Accounts Receivable has been reduced by $74.2 million for amounts that had been sold under this program. To finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates relying on continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2009, $985.2 million was available for borrowing under VFs $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed domestic revolving bank credit facility, with 39 $14.8 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. This credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings. Also at the end of 2009, 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $358.3 million) was available for borrowing under VFs senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit facility. We used cash of $212.3 million, $93.4 million and $1,060.6 million for acquisitions in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is net of cash balances in the acquired companies. These acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances as well as for the 2007 acquisitions short term commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. In 2007, we received $348.7 million in proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business. Capital expenditures were $85.9 million in 2009, compared with $124.2 million and $113.9 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to our retail stores, distribution network and information systems, as well as maintenance spending across our global supply chain. We expect that capital spending could reach $110 million in 2010. Capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. During 2007, VF received $592.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of $600.0 million principal amount of 5.95% senior notes due in 2017 and 6.45% senior notes due in 2037. Also during 2007, VF paid $78.1 million under the international bank credit agreement and $33.0 million in notes related to the Nautica acquisition. See Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At the end of 2009, VFs long term debt ratings were A minus by Standard Poors Ratings Services and A3 by Moodys Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings were A 2 and Prime 2, respectively, by those rating agencies. Both agencies have a stable outlook for VF. Existing long term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, VF purchased 1.6 million, 2.0 million and 4.1 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The cost of these transactions was $112.0 million, $149.7 million and $350.0 million with an average price of $71.80 in 2009, $74.86 in 2008 and $85.03 in 2007. The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to offset, on a long term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 11.6 million shares (including 10.0 million shares authorized subsequent to the end of 2009). We currently intend to repurchase at least 3.0 million shares in 2010 and will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions, our Common Stock price and levels of stock option exercises. Cash dividends totaled $2.37 per common share in 2009, compared with $2.33 in 2008 and $2.23 in 2007. Our dividend payout rate was 46.0% in 2009 (excluding the effect of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge), compared with payout rates of 43.0% in 2008 and 42.7% in 2007. On a longer term basis, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2010 is $2.40 per share. 40 Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2009 that will require the use of funds: Payment Due or Forecasted by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter In millions Recorded liabilities: Long term debt(1) $ 1,149 $ 203 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 934 Other(2) 383 68 45 42 33 34 161 Unrecorded commitments: Interest payment obligations(3) 1,203 71 58 58 58 57 901 Operating leases(4) 898 180 159 131 107 95 226 Minimum royalty payments(5) 318 59 78 79 50 52 Inventory obligations(6) 742 690 15 15 15 7 Other obligations(7) 72 43 14 9 5 1 Total $ 4,765 $ 1,314 $ 372 $ 337 $ 271 $ 249 $ 2,222 (1) Long term debt, including the current portion, consists of required principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for other noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet. Payments for deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. (3) Interest payment obligations represent (i) required interest payments on long term debt, (ii) the interest portion of payments on capital leases and (iii) accretion of debt discount (in the Thereafter column) on the $300.0 million principal amount of notes. Amounts exclude bank fees, amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain that would be included in Interest Expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance. Such costs, which are not included above, average approximately 20% of the stated minimum lease payments. Total lease commitments exclude $9.4 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases. (5) Minimum royalty payments include required minimum advertising commitments under license agreements. (6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. The reported amount excludes inventory purchase liabilities included in Accounts Payable at December 2009. (7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. We have other financial commitments at the end of 2009 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether or when further contributions will be required. VF has entered into $84.5 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims obligations. Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments are not included in the table. 41 During 2009 VF met its obligations when due from cash flows from operations and, for seasonal needs, issuance of commercial paper; there were no borrowings under our domestic or international bank facilities during the year. Credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the United States and global capital markets during 2008, particularly during the last half of that year and continuing into early 2009, had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period (although for generally shorter maturities and at higher spreads over U.S. Treasury interest rates than in prior years) reflecting our investment grade credit rating and a $1.0 billion committed revolving bank credit facility that supports our commercial paper program. If the commercial paper markets were not available, VF has a total of $1.3 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international committed revolving bank credit agreements that do not expire until October 2012. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of business (discussed below), and we regularly assess these potential risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or (iii) creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate or other financial asset or index. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Insured risks We self insure a substantial portion of our property, vehicle, medical, workers compensation, director and officer, and general liability exposures and purchase insurance from unrelated highly rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of exposures retained by VF. Cash and equivalents risks VF had $731.5 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2009. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase. These investments consist of institutional money market funds that invest only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and time deposits in highly rated U.S. and foreign commercial banks. Considering recent credit market conditions and the weakened financial condition of many banks and other financial institutions, we continually monitor VFs cash equivalents and the credit ratings of VFs financial institutions. Similarly, we monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in our pension plan portfolios. Defined benefit pension plan risks VF is subject to funding risks of its defined benefit pension plans. Due to substantial pension plan investment portfolio losses incurred in 2008, VF recognized a significant liability representing the underfunded status of the plans and a significant charge to Stockholders Equity at the end of 2008. We contributed over $200 million to the plans during 2009 and are committed to returning the plans to a fully funded status, including making further contributions, if necessary, in future years. At the end of 2009, the underfunded status of the plans had improved to $250.9 million. Interest rate risks We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since all of our long term debt has fixed interest rates, our interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short term borrowings for seasonal working capital needs. These variable rate borrowings averaged approximately $220 million during 2009. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents. Based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash equivalents during 2009, the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates would not be significant. 42 Foreign currency exchange rate risks VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2009 were generated in international markets. Substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2007, we entered into an international bank credit agreement that provides for euro denominated borrowings. Although there were no borrowings under this agreement during 2009, borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our euro denominated net assets. Net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia, are considered to be long term, and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders Equity. We do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar. We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and in the ordinary course of business enter into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of our forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange rate movements on VFs cash flows, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months (relating to cross border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Currently, we use only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future. If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2009, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $90 million. Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying balance sheet positions impacted by the currency rate changes. Counterparty risks VF is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and enter into derivative transactions only with financial institutions with A minus/A3 investment grade credit ratings or better. We continually monitor the credit rating of, and our hedging positions with, each counterparty. Additionally, we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our positions if necessary. We also monitor counterparty risk for derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans. Commodity price risks VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which may impact fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics, in some cases for up to one year in advance. VF has not historically managed, nor do we currently intend to manage, commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. Deferred compensation and related investment security risks VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to our operating results and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, we may retain outside specialists to assist in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business acquisition, testing goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment, equity compensation, pension benefits and self insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style size color stockkeeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving or excess or off quality, we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. Long lived Assets We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. We evaluate fair value using three valuation techniques the replacement cost, market and income methods and weight the valuation method or methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective. Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value, if any. Our amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating expected benefits to be received for customer related intangible assets, we consider historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license related intangible assets, we consider historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on our experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions. 44 We review property and definite lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We test for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset, there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of major trademarks, and goodwill are not subject to amortization. Rather, we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual strategic planning process, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value. Fair value of an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership) from an independent party, and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. If the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit having goodwill using a required two step approach. Our reporting units are either our coalitions or a component of a coalition if that component is a business unit for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management. Two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of a business unit, including its recorded goodwill, to the fair value of the business unit. We estimate the fair value of a business unit using both income based and market based valuation methodologies. The principal method used is an income based method in which the business units forecasted cash flows are discounted to a present value. In the market based valuation method, the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for (i) a group of comparable public companies and (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. We evaluate the range of fair values developed from the income and market based methods and determine the best fair value estimate for our business unit. If the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. The second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) as if the business unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. The income based fair value methodology requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in the U.S. capital markets, many of which are outside managements control. At the business unit level, fair value estimation requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit, along with assessment of the business units strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve managements estimates and assumptions regarding: Cash flows arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending, depreciation, amortization and income taxes for a 10 year forecast period. A terminal growth rate of the business unit for years beyond our 10 year financial forecast period. At 10 years, the forecast assumes that the business has matured and long term growth levels have been reached. This terminal growth rate is generally comparable with historical growth rates for overall consumer spending and, more specifically, for apparel spending in the United States. 45 A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk free rate of return on long term Treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparably sized companies, beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. Under the market based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of our business units. We evaluated our goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets for possible impairment during the fourth quarter of 2009. Based on analysis of current and expected future economic conditions and our updated strategic plan for each of our business units, we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill at our Reef, Nautica and lucy business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at our Reef and lucy business units exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, we recognized in our 2009 Consolidated Statement of Income impairment charges of $101.9 million to write down the carrying value of goodwill and $20.1 million to write down the carrying value of nonamortized trademark intangible assets. The total noncash charge of $122.0 million had an insignificant impact on our financial position and no impact on our liquidity or debt agreements. The charge was based on significant estimates and judgments by management; changes to the fair value assumptions used for the Reef, Nautica and lucy business units potentially would have resulted in different goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges. See Notes G, H and U of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the impairment charges recorded for these business units. For our other business units, the estimated fair values of those business units and the fair values of their trademark intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009. Accordingly, no goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded for our other business units. For our Reef, Nautica and lucy business units and for our other business units, it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill or trademark intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) overall economic conditions in 2010 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment change for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Stock Options We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before exercise. For each option grant, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. We based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near the money options on VF Common Stock. We measured historical volatility over a ten year period, 46 corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term. Pension Obligations VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full time domestic employees initially employed before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for determination of our projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. We annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. We believe our assumptions are reflective of the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate specifically to our U.S. pension plans, which comprise over 90% of the assets and projected benefit liabilities of our combined domestic and international plans.) The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations at each measurement date. The discount rate reflects the interest rate inherent in the price that VF could settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. Our discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to be made to participants in our U.S. pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service or, if a Moodys rating is not available, bonds rated Aa by two other recognized rating services. From this population of over 500 such bonds having at least $50 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputtable unless with make whole provisions, we exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans distinct liability characteristics. We believe that those Aa rated issues meet the high quality intent of the applicable accounting standards and that our 2009 discount rate of 6.05% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our domestic pension plans. This lower discount rate, compared with the rate of 6.50% at the end of 2008, reflects stabilization of the credit markets in the past year and the general decline in yields of high quality corporate bonds of all maturities. The discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans longer duration of expected benefit payments due to (i) a higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and (ii) a higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investment assets in our domestic qualified plans pension trust. Our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign securities risks. Investment assets are comprised of a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income, real estate and commodity securities. We develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on several factors, including the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The weighted average of the projected long term rates of return for the various classes of assets held by the qualified plan provides the basis for the expected long term rate of return actuarial assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 8.00% in 2009 and 2008 and 8.25% in 2007. The rate of return is a forward looking assumption. While our actual compounded annual rate of return was lower than the 8.00% assumption for the trailing 10 and 15 year periods, our compounded rate of return since 1981 has exceeded 9%. We 47 have not changed the overall target mix of investment assets during 2009; however, we altered the investment mix to add commodities as a new asset class. Looking forward, we plan to increase the allocation of equity investments to international equity investments and reduce the allocation to domestic equity investments. As the qualified plan becomes fully funded, our intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments, thereby better matching the effect of interest rate changes on a portion of the value of our plans investment assets with the benefit obligations they are intended to fund. These changes in asset allocation should, over time, reduce the year to year variability of our domestic plans funded status and resulting pension expense. We will constantly challenge our plans asset allocation, giving consideration to changes that will appropriately balance anticipated investment returns with risk. Based on an evaluation of market conditions, projected market returns and planned changes in investment mix, we will be using a rate of return assumption of 7.75% for our U.S. plan for 2010. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants. In 2008, there was a significant decline in the market value of our pension plan investment assets due to the global credit and financial market crisis, which resulted in the plans being underfunded by $414.9 million at the end of 2008. This underfunded status was presented in our 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet by recognition of liabilities of that amount. Our underfunded status improved during 2009 primarily from substantial VF cash contributions to the plans totaling over $200 million and significant investment earnings on pension plan assets, partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations due to a decline in the discount rate during the year. The resulting underfunded status in our 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet was $250.9 million, represented by $3.3 million of current liabilities and $247.6 million of noncurrent liabilities. The funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance, the level of VF contributions to the pension plans, changes in the discount rate used to value projected benefit obligations or other factors. Differences in any year between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that years pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the balance sheet. The substantial investment losses incurred in 2008 was the primary reason that the plans had over $450 million of pretax accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses at the end of 2008, which resulted in deferred actuarial losses of $291.0 million after tax in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. During 2009, investment returns in our pension plans substantially exceeded the actuarially assumed investment return, resulting in a deferred actuarial gain. This was partially offset, however, by a deferred actuarial loss in 2009 from an increase in our projected benefit obligations resulting from a lower discount rate used to value those obligations at the end of 2009. Accordingly, our net pretax cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of $431.5 million at the end of 2009 resulted in deferred actuarial losses of $266.0 million after tax in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy is to amortize any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows: amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of investment assets or projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are not amortized; amounts totaling 10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants; and amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over five years. Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was $98.0 million in 2009, $10.8 million in 2008 and $13.1 million in 2007. This compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees (commonly called service cost) of $14.9 million in 2009 and an average of $17.7 million per year over the last three years. Pension expense for 2009 was significantly higher than the annual service cost because 2009 included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Looking forward, our 2010 pension expense will also include a significant cost component (but lower than in 2009) for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses. With this lower amortization cost component for 2010 and, more importantly, greater assumed earnings due to the sharp increase in plan assets during 2009 (including over $200 million of VF contributions), we expect our 2010 pension expense to decline to approximately $66 million. 48 The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2009 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2009, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Projected Pension Expense Benefit Obligations Dollars in millions 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 13 $ 83 0.50% increase in discount rate (12 ) (77 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 3 0.50% increase in expected investment return (3 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (1 ) (4 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 1 4 As previously mentioned, we made $200.0 million of discretionary contributions to our domestic qualified pension plan during 2009. VF is not required under applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a contribution to the domestic qualified pension plan during 2010 but does intend to make contributions totaling approximately $8 million during 2010 to its other pension plans. We believe that VF has sufficient liquidity to make contributions to our pension plans, as necessary, in future years to return the plans to a fully or substantially fully funded status. Beginning in 2005, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after 2004, plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, participate in a defined contribution plan with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds contributed are invested as directed by the participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our total retirement benefit expense over the last three years. However, on a longer term basis, the service cost component of our defined benefit plans expense will decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense, and the year to year variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease. Income Taxes As a global company, VF is subject to income tax and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment. VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential issues under the more likely than not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which accruals have been established, or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than established accruals. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. We have recorded $143.6 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and we have recorded $99.2 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. In addition, we have recorded $11.2 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss 49 carryforwards. If in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period. We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because we have asserted that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that period. Non GAAP Financial Information VF is a global company that reports financial information in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. These exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results and, accordingly, can affect the comparability of reported results. To better explain our operating results, we use constant currency information, which excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates, to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods. Accordingly, we have provided supplemental constant currency financial information, which is a non GAAP financial measure, in the Analysis of Results of Operations section. Constant currency information represents the current year reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation effects of changes in exchange rates. To calculate Coalition Revenues on a constant currency basis, revenues for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period). We believe the following supplemental constant currency financial information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses: Year Ended December 2009 Exclude Impact of Foreign Constant As Reported Currency Exchange Currency In millions Coalition Revenues Outdoor Action Sports $ 2,752 $ (76 ) $ 2,828 Jeanswear 2,522 (77 ) 2,599 Imagewear 865 866 Sportswear 498 498 Contemporary Brands 472 (3 ) 475 Other 111 110 Total coalition revenues $ 7,220 $ (156 ) $ 7,376 In addition, we discuss operating results in the preceding Analysis of Results of Operations section excluding the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets. We believe this non GAAP financial 50 information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses: Year Ended December 2009 Exclude Impairment As Reported Charge As Adjusted In millions Income Before Income Taxes $ 655 $ (122 ) $ 777 Income Taxes 196 (8 ) 204 Net Income 458 (114 ) 573 Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries 3 3 Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation $ 461 $ (114 ) $ 576 Earnings Per Share Attributable to VF Corporation Common Stockholders Basic $ 4.18 $ (1.04 ) $ 5.22 Diluted 4.13 (1.03 ) 5.16 (Above amounts may not add due to rounding.) These constant currency and other non GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP. Also, this supplemental information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1A. of this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. A discussion of VFs market risks is incorporated by reference to Risk Management in Item 7.
