Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel and related products. Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in many consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and governmental customers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus direct to consumer channels. VFs businesses are grouped by product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for internal financial reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses within VF are referred to as coalitions and are the basis for VFs reportable business segments, as described below: Coalition Principal VF owned Brands Outdoor Action Sports The North Face, Vans, JanSport, Eastpak, Kipling (outside North America), Napapijri, Reef, Eagle Creek, lucy Jeanswear Wrangler, Lee, Riders, Rustler, Timber Creek by Wrangler Imagewear Red Kap, Bulwark, Majestic Sportswear Nautica, Kipling (within North America) Contemporary Brands 7 For All Mankind, John Varvatos, Splendid, Ella Moss Impact of the Current Global Economic Environment The global recession from late 2007 through mid 2009 was the longest and most severe recession in the last several decades. This recession, with its flat to falling consumer income levels, sharp declines in real estate and securities markets, volatility in commodity and currency markets, significant increases in unemployment, numerous retailer and other bankruptcies and unprecedented government stimulus programs, led to a decline in consumer spending that impacted VF as well as most other companies. The economic recovery in most developed countries over the last 18 months has been slow. Consumer spending, representing about 70% of the U.S. economy, has advanced slowly during this period and has only recently returned to pre recession levels. Some of these headwinds will continue to impact VF and our competitors. In response to the challenging market conditions of the last three years, we have been aggressive in controlling our costs and operating with lean inventory levels. Our balance sheet, cash flows from operations and liquidity have remained strong. And we have continued to invest in our brands. During 2010, we increased our investments in advertising and product development by over $100 million compared with the prior year. These investments were 27 Table of Contents very targeted and were concentrated in our brands having the greatest opportunities for growth, including The North Face, Vans and our businesses in Asia. We will continue this higher level of investment spending during 2011, as we believe the strength of our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic climate. Highlights of 2010 Following are the notable actions and achievements in 2010: Revenues grew to a record $7.7 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year, led by our Outdoor Action Sports businesses. Revenues of The North Face and Vans rose 18% and 20%, respectively, over the prior year. Our businesses in Asia continued to experience significant growth, with revenues up 31% over the prior year. Our direct to consumer business revenues grew 13% over the prior year and represented 18% of Total Revenues in 2010. We opened 85 stores during the year. Gross margin reached a record level of 46.7%. Marketing spending increased 30% over the prior year as we continued to invest in our high growth, highly profitable brands and initiatives. Excluding noncash impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets discussed in the Analysis of Results of Operations section below, operating income reached a record level and was in excess of $1.0 billion. Also, excluding these charges, net income of $713.2 million and earnings per share of $6.46 per share were each at all time highs. (All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.) References to financial results excluding the impact of the impairment charges are non GAAP measures and addressed below in the Non GAAP Financial Information section. Our record $1.0 billion of cash flow from operating activities allowed us to increase our cash balance, while funding (i) $412 million of repurchases of our Common Stock, (ii) $264 million of dividends, (iii) $203 million in payments of long term debt, (iv) $150 million of investments in capital expenditures and acquisitions and (v) over $100 million in contributions to our pension plans. We ended the year with $792 million of cash and equivalents. And with our A minus investment grade credit rating, we continued to have access to capital markets and had over $1.3 billion available under bank credit agreements. We increased our dividends paid per share for the 38th consecutive year. We purchased the remaining 50% equity interest of a joint venture that marketed the Vans brand in Mexico (Vans Mexico). Analysis of Results of Operations Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues during the last two years: 2010 2009 Compared with Compared with In millions 2009 2008 Total revenues prior year $ 7,220 $ 7,643 Impact of foreign currency translation (21 ) (156 ) Organic growth (decline) 463 (344 ) Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 13 16 Acquisition in current year 28 61 Total revenues current year $ 7,703 $ 7,220 28 Table of Contents Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues increased 7% in 2010, led by 14% growth in our Outdoor Action Sports businesses. In addition, while not to the same extent, revenues increased in most of our other businesses. Revenues declined 6% in 2009, with 2% of the decline due to foreign currency translation. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies of those countries where VF conducts the majority of its international business (primarily Europe/euro based countries) negatively impacted revenue by $21 million in 2010 relative to 2009 and $156 million in 2009 relative to 2008. The weighted average translation rates for the euro were $1.33, $1.39 and $1.47 per euro for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of Income: 2010 2009 2008 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 46.7 % 44.3 % 43.9 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 33.4 32.4 31.7 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 2.6 1.7 Operating income 10.7 % 10.2 % 12.3 % Approximately 1.3% of the improvement in gross margin percentage in 2010 over 2009 was due to (i) a greater percentage of our revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses, including our direct to consumer operations, and (ii) other areas of operational improvements, including retail and inventory efficiencies. The remaining 1.1% improvement resulted from product cost reductions. The gross margin percentage increased 1.4% in 2009 over 2008 from the impact of our growing direct to consumer operations, which have gross margin percentages higher than VF averages. In addition, gross margins improved in 2009 due to lower levels and improved profitability on disposal of distressed inventories. These increases were partially offset by lower gross margins in our European jeanswear and imagewear businesses. See the Information by Business Segment section below. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues increased 1.0% in 2010 over 2009 due to increased marketing spending in 2010, as discussed above, and 0.4% due to higher growth than average in our direct to consumer business, which has a higher expense ratio than our wholesale business. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic pension expense, which reduced the ratio by 0.6% in 2010 compared with 2009. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues increased 1.2% in 2009 over 2008 due to higher domestic pension expense and 1.1% due to higher growth than average in our direct to consumer business. The 2009 comparison benefited from (i) the absence of charges from cost reduction actions, which increased Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses by 0.7% as a percent of revenues in 2008, and (ii) the benefit of these actions and other spending reductions in 2009. We completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 in conjunction with finalizing our strategic plan. Based on our assessment of current and expected economic conditions, trends and forecasted cash flows at each business unit, and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing our business units, VF management determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and trademark intangible asset at its 7 For All Mankind business unit exceeded the respective fair values. Accordingly, VF recorded a noncash impairment charge totaling $201.7 million ($141.8 million net of related income tax benefits) to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and the trademark intangible asset of this business unit to their fair values. This charge represents all of the recorded goodwill for the 7 For All Mankind business unit and 40% of the consolidated goodwill and nonamortized trademark balances for this business unit. Similarly, as a result of our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009, VF management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its Reef, Nautica, and lucy business units and trademark intangible assets at its Reef and lucy business units exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, VF recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $122.0 million ($114.4 million net of related income tax benefits) to 29 Table of Contents reduce these carrying values to their fair values. Of this total, Reef represented $36.7 million, Nautica represented $58.5 million and lucy represented $26.8 million (23%, 14% and 26%, respectively, of each businesses combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible asset balances). For additional information, see Notes F, G and T to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below. Interest income was flat in 2010 compared with 2009, but decreased $3.9 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased $8.2 million in 2010 from 2009 due to reduced short term borrowing levels and the payment of $200 million of notes that matured in 2010. The $8.1 million decline in interest expense in 2009 from 2008 was due primarily to lower short term borrowing levels. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled $1,136 million for 2010, $1,364 million for 2009 and $1,454 million for 2008, with Short term Borrowings representing 4.0%, 16.2% and 21.2% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.6% for 2010, 6.1% for 2009 and 6.3% for 2008. The increase in the weighted average interest rate in 2010 resulted from a reduction in commercial paper borrowings, which bear lower interest rates. In connection with the Vans Mexico acquisition, we recognized a $5.7 million gain in Miscellaneous Income during 2010 from remeasuring our previous 50% investment in the joint venture to fair value. Excluding the impairment charges discussed above, the tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 24.9% and 26.2%, respectively, compared with 28.9% in 2008. During 2010, we recorded tax benefits of $20.5 million related to prior years refund claims and tax credits and $5.6 million of tax benefits related to expirations of statutes of limitations in international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded. These items lowered our 2010 annual tax rate by 2.7%. During 2009, we recorded tax benefits of $17.5 million related to favorable outcomes of U.S. state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several U.S. state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded. These items lowered our 2009 annual tax rate by 2.3%. During 2008, we recorded tax benefits of (i) $24.6 million related primarily to favorable outcomes of foreign tax audits, expirations of statutes of limitations in foreign jurisdictions and other state tax benefits and (ii) $11.5 million to reflect updated assessments of previously accrued amounts. These items lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 4.3%. After considering the impact of the unusual items discussed above, the remaining declines in the effective income tax rates in 2010 from 2009 and in 2009 from 2008 were primarily attributed to growth in our international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially lower than rates in the United States. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation increased to $571.4 million in 2010 from $461.3 million in 2009, while earnings per share increased to $5.18 in 2010 from $4.13 in 2009. Excluding the impairment charges noted above, earnings per share were $6.46 in 2010 and $5.16 in 2009. The increase in earnings per share in 2010 over 2009 resulted primarily from improved operating performance, as discussed in the Information by Business Segment section below, and lower domestic pension expense, which benefited earnings per share in 2010 by $0.20. These benefits were partially offset by cost reduction actions that negatively impacted earnings per share in 2010 by $0.09. There were no similar actions taken in 2009. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased to $461.3 million in 2009 from $602.7 million in 2008, while earnings per share decreased to $4.13 in 2009 from $5.42 in 2008. Earnings per share in 2009 were $5.16 excluding impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets. Earnings per share in 2009 compared with 2008 were negatively impacted by (i) higher domestic pension expense of $0.48 and (ii) an unfavorable impact of $0.18 from translating foreign currencies into a stronger U.S. dollar. The earnings per share comparison in 2009 benefited from the absence of charges of $0.30 per share for cost reduction actions taken in 2008. Information by Business Segment Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues, operating income and assets, hereinafter termed Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit, respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment. 30 Table of Contents Corporate costs (other than costs charged directly to the coalitions), impairment charges and net interest expense are not controlled by coalition management and therefore are excluded from the Coalition Profit performance measure used for internal management reporting. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income Before Income Taxes. To leverage the scale of VF, there are a number of functions that are shared across all coalitions. Accordingly, coalition results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been reported had each coalition been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. The following tables present a summary of the changes in our Total Revenues and Coalition Profit by coalition during the last two years: Outdoor Action Contemporary In millions Sports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other Coalition Revenues 2008 $ 2,807 $ 2,765 $ 991 $ 571 $ 386 $ 123 Impact of foreign currency translation (76 ) (77 ) (3 ) Organic growth (decline) 75 (182 ) (126 ) (73 ) (26 ) (12 ) Acquisitions in prior year 16 Acquisition in current year 61 Coalition Revenues 2009 2,806 2,522 865 498 418 111 Impact of foreign currency translation (31 ) 9 5 (5 ) 1 Organic growth 402 7 39 13 2 Acquisition in prior year 13 Acquisition in current year 28 Coalition Revenues 2010 $ 3,205 $ 2,538 $ 909 $ 498 $ 439 $ 114 Outdoor Action Contemporary In millions Sports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear Brands Other Coalition Profit 2008 $ 442 $ 379 $ 132 $ 42 $ 64 $ (3 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (16 ) (8 ) (2 ) 1 Operations 67 1 (45 ) 10 (9 ) 4 Coalition Profit 2009 493 372 87 52 53 2 Impact of foreign currency translation (4 ) 6 1 (1 ) Operations 153 54 23 (38 ) (1 ) Coalition Profit 2010 $ 642 $ 432 $ 111 $ 52 $ 14 $ 1 Operating results of the lucy business unit have been reclassified from the Contemporary Brands Coalition to the Outdoor Action Sports Coalition consistent with the change in internal management reporting beginning in 2010. Outdoor Action Sports: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Coalition Revenues $ 3,204.7 $ 2,806.1 $ 2,807.3 14.2 % 0.0 % Coalition Profit 642.4 492.9 442.5 30.3 % 11.4 % Operating Margin 20.0 % 17.6 % 15.8 % This coalition consists of VFs outdoor and action sports related businesses including The North Face brand apparel, footwear and equipment, Vans performance and casual footwear and apparel, JanSport and Eastpak 31 Table of Contents backpacks and apparel, Kipling bags and accessories, Napapijri outdoor based sportswear, Reef beach inspired footwear and apparel, lucy womens apparel and Eagle Creek adventure travel gear. The Outdoor Action Sports Coalition achieved record revenues, operating income and operating margin in 2010. The 14% increase in revenues was driven by growth in The North Face and Vans brands of 18% and 20%, respectively, over the prior year. These brands experienced growth in both domestic and international markets. Direct to consumer revenues for this coalition rose 20% in 2010 over 2009, with double digit growth in The North Face, Vans, Kipling, Napapijri and lucy retail businesses as we benefited from new store openings, growth in comp store sales and expansion of our e commerce business. Revenues in Asia increased 31% in 2010 over the prior year. Coalition Revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported basis compared with 2008 and 3% on a constant currency basis. Reported global revenues of The North Face increased by 6% (including a negative impact of 3% from foreign currency translation) and Vans increased by 5% (including a negative impact of 2% from foreign currency translation). In addition, revenues in Asia increased by more than 50%, largely due to increases in the Vans brand, which was just introduced into China in 2008. These increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and revenue declines in the other coalition businesses. The operating margin improvement in 2010 over 2009 was driven by (i) a 2.5% increase in gross margin, reflecting improvements in retail store performance and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories, and (ii) the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. These operating margin improvements were partially offset by a significant increase in marketing spending that negatively impacted operating margin comparisons by 1.2% in 2010 compared with 2009. Approximately one half of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 resulted from an increased gross margin, with higher margin direct to consumer revenues making up a larger portion of total Coalition Revenues in 2009. In addition, the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 0.3% from a charge for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009. The remainder of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 was due to lower spending, partially offset by continued investments to expand the direct to consumer business. Jeanswear: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Coalition Revenues $ 2,537.6 $ 2,522.5 $ 2,764.9 0.6 % (8.8 )% Coalition Profit 431.9 370.9 378.9 16.5 % (2.1 )% Operating Margin 17.0 % 14.7 % 13.7 % The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler and Lee brands. Domestic jeanswear revenues increased 2% in 2010 over 2009, with 3% growth in both our Wrangler and Lee brands reflecting the positive impact of new products introduced during the year. Domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4% in 2009 from 2008 due to a difficult retail environment, including the loss of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and a reduction in noncore Riders brand plus size and seasonal programs (some of which were reinstated in 2010). International jeanswear revenues, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, declined 3% in 2010, with lower revenues in Europe partially offset by 36% revenue growth in Asia and double digit growth in all other foreign markets. The decline in Europe resulted from the decision in 2009 to exit our mass market jeans business in Europe, as well as continued difficult business conditions in the overall European jeanswear market. Jeanswear revenues in international markets declined 18% in 2009 from 2008, with 8% of the decline resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency translation. The remainder of the decline was driven by recessionary conditions, especially in Europe, and the mass market jeans business exit in Europe. These declines were partially offset by a 14% increase in jeanswear revenues in Asia. 32 Table of Contents The improvement in operating margin in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a 2.6% higher gross margin reflecting (i) lower product costs, particularly in our U.S. jeanswear businesses, and (ii) lower levels of and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories. Operating margin comparisons in 2010 also benefited from the 2009 exit of the European mass market jeans business, which had operating margins that were well below the coalition average. These benefits were partially offset by increased marketing spending and charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted 2010 operating margin comparisons by 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. The Jeanswear operating margin in 2009, compared with 2008, benefited by 1.0% from charges for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009. The negative impact of higher distressed inventory provisions in our European businesses in 2009 was offset by lower spending across the coalition due in part to the 2008 cost reduction actions. Imagewear: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Coalition Revenues $ 909.4 $ 865.5 $ 991.1 5.1 % (12.7 )% Coalition Profit 111.2 87.5 131.6 27.1 % (33.5 )% Operating Margin 12.2 % 10.1 % 13.3 % The Imagewear Coalition consists of VFs Image business (occupational apparel and uniforms) and Licensed Sports business (licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel). Image business revenues increased 8% in 2010 over 2009 due to strength in the industrial and protective sectors resulting from the gradual economic recovery and the competitive advantage of our quick response service model. Licensed sports revenues increased 3% in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to growth in our licensed National Football League business. Image business revenues declined 17% in 2009 from 2008 due to rising unemployment, particularly in the manufacturing and petrochemical sectors. Licensed sports revenues were down 8% in 2009 from 2008, resulting from lower attendance at sporting events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products. Operating margin increased 1.5% in 2010 over 2009 due to higher gross margins, resulting primarily from an improved mix of business. The remainder of the increase was driven by improved leverage of operating expenses on a higher level of revenues. Operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty agreements in our licensed sports business. Sportswear: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Coalition Revenues $ 497.8 $ 498.3 $ 570.7 (0.1 )% (12.7 )% Coalition Profit 52.4 52.0 41.6 0.7 % 25.0 % Operating Margin 10.5 % 10.4 % 7.3 % The Sportswear Coalition consists of our Nautica and Kipling brand businesses in North America (the Kipling brand outside of North America is managed by the Outdoor Action Sports Coalition). Sportswear Coalition Revenues were flat in 2010 compared with 2009. A 2% decline in Nautica brand revenues during 2010 due to lower volume in our owned outlet stores was offset by 30% growth in our Kipling brand revenues. The increase in Kipling brand revenues resulted from growth in direct to consumer revenues, performance in specialty stores and the successful launch in early 2010 of a new program that is exclusive with Macys, Inc. 33 Table of Contents The decline in Coalition Revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven by a 13% decrease in Nautica brand revenues, resulting from difficult market conditions in the department store channel and lower volume in our owned outlet stores. The Sportswear Coalition operating margins were flat in 2010 compared with 2009. An improvement in gross margin percentage of 0.7% resulted from (i) lower markdown activity in the department store channel and our outlet store channel, (ii) lower levels of excess inventory coming into 2010 and (iii) a higher percentage of Kipling revenues, which have higher gross margins than the coalition average. This improvement was offset by higher marketing spending. The Sportswear Coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from 2008 due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in our Nautica business. Also, the 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 1.0% from charges for cost reduction actions taken in 2008 that did not recur in 2009, including the cost for the exit of the Nautica womens wholesale sportswear business. Contemporary Brands: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Coalition Revenues $ 438.7 $ 417.7 $ 385.9 5.0 % 8.2 % Coalition Profit 14.0 50.8 63.5 (72.4 )% (20.0 )% Operating Margin 3.2 % 12.2 % 16.5 % This coalition consists of the 7 For All Mankind brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the John Varvatos luxury apparel collection for men. This coalition also includes the operating results of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands comprised of the earnings from our one third equity investment from June 2008 through March 2009, when the remaining two thirds equity interest was purchased, and the consolidated operating results thereafter. The growth in Coalition Revenues in 2010 resulted from the 2009 acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands, which contributed an incremental $24 million in revenues in 2010, and 10% revenue growth in our John Varvatos business. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decrease in global 7 For All Mankind brand revenues, reflecting volume declines due to continued soft conditions in the premium denim market. Expanding the 7 For All Mankind direct to consumer business is an important part of our growth strategy for this brand, and in 2010 we opened 20 retail stores. The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2009 was due to the acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands. This increase was partially offset by an 8% decline in global 7 For All Mankind brand revenues, driven by challenging conditions in the U.S. upper tier department and specialty store channel. The 7 For All Mankind brand grew in Asia, where revenues nearly doubled, and in the brands direct to consumer business, where revenues more than tripled. The decline in operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 was driven by investments in new 7 For All Mankind retail stores, higher marketing spending, the write off of fixtures at eight underperforming retail stores that had been opened in previous years and lower margins associated with selling excess quantities of inventory. The operating margin comparison was also negatively impacted by 1.5% due to the favorable resolution of a value added tax and duty matter during 2009 that did not recur in 2010. These decreases were partially offset by improved operating results in our John Varvatos business, which had a positive operating margin in 2010 after generating operating losses in prior years. Operating margins were negatively impacted in 2009 compared with 2008 by volume declines in our 7 For All Mankind wholesale business that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio, increased retail investments across the coalition and higher operating losses in 2009 in our John Varvatos business. The 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 1.5% from charges in 2008 related to a value added tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives that did not recur. Operating margins for the 7 For All Mankind and Splendid and Ella Moss brands in 2009 were above the coalition average, at 16% and 20%, respectively. 34 Table of Contents Other: Percent Change Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Revenues $ 114.4 $ 110.2 $ 122.7 3.8 % (10.2 )% Profit (0.1 ) 1.2 (2.4 ) Operating Margin (0.1 )% 1.1 % (2.0 )% The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business, which is a group of VF operated outlet stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non VF products, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic, are reported in this business segment. While revenues in the Other business segment were flat in 2010 compared with 2009, the decline in revenues in 2009 from 2008 was due to the impact of the economic recession on consumer spending. Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes: There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks, Interest, and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks and Interest Expense, Net were discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks is excluded from Coalition Profit as they represent charges that are not a part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses. See the Non GAAP Financial Information section below. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows: In millions 2010 2009 2008 Information systems and shared services $ 185.2 $ 164.7 $ 178.2 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (143.7 ) (143.7 ) (150.3 ) 41.5 21.0 27.9 Corporate headquarters costs 110.9 72.6 79.3 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 12.1 11.1 11.3 Other 60.0 90.3 1.1 Corporate and Other Expenses $ 224.5 $ 195.0 $ 119.6 Information Systems and Shared Services Included are costs of our management information systems and our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2010 from 2009 resulted from the overall growth of our businesses, increased spending related to reconfiguring our western hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated with changing third party data center providers. The decrease in information systems and shared services costs in 2009 from 2008 is primarily due to reductions in third party data center charges and amortization. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are 35 Table of Contents not apportioned to the coalitions. The increase in corporate headquarters costs in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, increased contributions to the VF Foundation and significantly higher investments in strategy and innovation. The decline in corporate headquarters costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced spending as part of our cost reduction efforts. Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. Other This category includes (i) costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting, (ii) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments, the most significant of which is related to the expense of our centrally managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Coalition Profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense. Pension costs totaling $46.9 million for 2010 and $83.1 million for 2009, primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses, were recorded in other expense. These costs were not significant in 2008. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets Accounts Receivable at December 2010 were in line with the balance at December 2009. Increases in accounts receivable related to higher wholesale revenues near the end of 2010 compared with the 2009 period were offset by (i) an improvement in collections reflected in lower days sales outstanding and (ii) an increase in accounts receivable balances sold, as discussed in the Liquidity and Cash Flows section below and in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories increased 12% at December 2010 over the December 2009 balance due to (i) expected revenue growth in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior year period, (ii) rising inventory costs and (iii) accelerated purchases of fabric in anticipation of the expected price increases. These increases were partially offset by an improvement in our number of days of inventory on hand, compared with the end of 2009. Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of 2010 was in line with the balance at the end of 2009 as the amount of depreciation expense approximated capital spending in 2010. Total Intangible Assets and Goodwill decreased in 2010 due to the impairment charges discussed above, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the addition of intangible assets and goodwill related to the Vans Mexico acquisition. Other Assets were higher at December 2010 due to an increase in deferred income tax assets, resulting primarily from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge discussed above. Short term Borrowings at December 2010 and December 2009 consisted of $36.6 million and $45.5 million, respectively, under international borrowing agreements. The Current Portion of Long term Debt was lower at December 2010 than December 2009 due to the payment of $200.0 million of 8.5% notes upon their maturity in 2010. The increase in Accounts Payable at December 2010 compared with December 2009 resulted from the timing of inventory purchases and other payments. The increase in Accrued Liabilities at December 2010 over December 2009 was driven primarily by higher incentive compensation accruals and the overall growth of our businesses. Other Liabilities at December 2010 decreased from 2009 due to (i) lower deferred income taxes and (ii) a reduction in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2010, as discussed in the following paragraph. 36 Table of Contents The recessionary conditions during 2008 resulted in a significant decline in the value of the investment portfolios of our defined benefit pension plans. As a result, our pension liability was over $400 million higher than pension assets at December 2008. To improve the funded status of our pension plans, we contributed over $200 million to these plans during 2009 and over $100 million in 2010. Accordingly, the plans underfunded status reported in our 2009 and 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheets was reduced to $250.9 million and $207.4 million, respectively. See Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below for a discussion of liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans. Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: Dollars in millions 2010 2009 Working capital $ 1,717.3 $ 1,536.8 Current ratio 2.5 to 1 2.4 to 1 Debt to total capital 20.2 % 23.7 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders equity. Our ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total capital defined as net debt plus stockholders equity, was 4.5% at the end of 2010. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash generated from operations, which was $1,001.3 million in 2010, $973.5 million in 2009 and $679.5 million in 2008, is primarily dependent on the level of Net Income, changes in accounts receivable, investments in inventories and other working capital components. Net Income was $573.5 million, $458.5 million and $602.8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Income in 2010 and 2009 were negatively impacted by noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of $201.7 million and $122.0 million, respectively. Operating cash flow for 2010 and 2009 included $100.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, of discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. There were no contributions to this plan in 2008. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future funding requirements. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements. The significant change in deferred income taxes for 2010 was driven by an increase in deferred income tax assets, resulting primarily from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in 2010. The net change in operating asset and liability components provided an increase to operating cash flow of $90.4 million in 2010 and $228.1 million in 2009, in contrast to reducing operating cash flows by $150.6 million in 2008. The positive cash generation from these components in 2010 was due to higher incentive compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities resulting from business growth in 2010. The increase in accounts payable at the end of 2010 was primarily offset by higher inventory levels. The positive cash generation from these components in 2009 was driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels and the sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below. The changes in operating cash flows from other current assets during 2009 resulted from an unusually high amount of prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008 benefited from an additional week of collections on accounts receivable in the 53rd week of the fiscal year in that collections sharply exceeded credit sales in that week. In 2009, VF entered into an agreement to sell selected trade accounts receivable, on a nonrecourse basis, to a financial institution. This agreement allows VF to have up to $192.5 million of accounts receivable held by the financial institution at any point in time. After the sale, VF continues to service and collect these accounts receivable on behalf of the financial institution but does not retain any other interests in the receivables. At the end of 2010 and 2009, accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets had been reduced by $112.3 million and $74.2 million, respectively, related to balances sold under this program. Net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized as part of the change in accounts receivable in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This program resulted in increases of $38.1 million and $74.2 million in operating cash flow in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 37 Table of Contents VF will rely on its continued strong cash generation to finance ongoing operations as well as most other circumstances that may arise. VF has significant existing liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2010, $983.3 million was available for borrowing under VFs $1.0 billion senior unsecured domestic revolving bank credit facility, with $16.7 million of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. This credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings. Also at the end of 2010, 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $334.2 million) was available for borrowing under VFs senior unsecured international revolving bank credit facility. VFs liquidity position is also enhanced by its favorable credit agency ratings, which allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates. At the end of 2010, VFs long term debt ratings were A minus by Standard Poors Ratings Services and A3 by Moodys Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings were A 2 and Prime 2, respectively, by those rating agencies. Both agencies have a stable outlook for VF. Existing long term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Cash of $38.3 million, $212.3 million and $93.4 million was used for acquisitions in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is net of cash balances in the acquired companies. These acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances. Capital expenditures were $111.6 million in 2010, compared with $85.9 million in 2009 and $124.2 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to our retail store rollout, distribution network and information systems. We expect that capital spending could reach $225 million in 2011, reflecting the need for office and distribution space for our expanding international and domestic outdoor businesses as well as an accelerated retail store opening plan. This spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, VF purchased 5.1 million, 1.6 million and 2.0 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The cost of these transactions was $411.8 million, $112.0 million and $149.7 million with an average price of $81.11 in 2010, $71.80 in 2009 and $74.86 in 2008. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 6.6 million shares. We will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions, our Common Stock price and levels of stock option exercises. Cash dividends totaled $2.43 per common share in 2010, compared with $2.37 in 2009 and $2.33 in 2008. Our dividend payout rate was 46.9% of our diluted earnings per share in 2010, 57.4% in 2009 and 43.0% in 2008 (37.6% in 2010 and 46.0% in 2009 excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in those years). On a longer term basis, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2011 is $2.52 per share. 38 Table of Contents Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2010 that will require the use of funds: Payment Due or Forecasted by Period In millions Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Recorded liabilities: Long term debt (1) $ 946 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 931 Other (2) 483 118 59 51 49 41 165 Unrecorded commitments: Interest payment obligations (3) 1,289 58 58 58 57 57 1,001 Operating leases (4) 895 188 157 131 109 95 215 Minimum royalty payments (5) 378 62 82 75 77 26 56 Inventory obligations (6) 907 854 15 15 15 8 Other obligations (7) 177 112 30 21 12 1 1 Total $ 5,075 $ 1,395 $ 404 $ 354 $ 322 $ 231 $ 2,369 (1) Long term debt, including the current portion, consists of required principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for other noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet. Payments for deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. (3) Interest payment obligations represent (i) required interest payments on long term debt, (ii) the interest portion of payments on capital leases and (iii) accretion of debt discount (in the Thereafter column) on the $300.0 million principal amount of notes. Amounts exclude bank fees, amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain that would be included in Interest Expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance. Such costs, which are not included above, average approximately 22% of the stated minimum lease payments. Total lease commitments exclude $10.4 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases. (5) Minimum royalty payments include required minimum advertising commitments under license agreements. (6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. The reported amount excludes inventory purchase liabilities included in Accounts Payable at December 2010. (7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. We have other financial commitments at the end of 2010 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: An agreement to acquire the trademarks and related intellectual property of Rock and Republic Enterprises, Inc. for approximately $57 million, subject to customary conditions and entry of a confirmation order in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether or when further contributions will be required. $89.9 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims or other obligations. 39 Table of Contents Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments. During 2010, VF used cash flows from operations to meet its obligations when due and, for seasonal needs, limited issuance of commercial paper; there were no borrowings under our domestic or international bank facilities during the year. Credit market conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the United States and global capital markets during the second half of 2008 and continuing into 2009 had a significant impact on the ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and other capital markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal working capital needs during this period reflecting our investment grade credit rating. If the commercial paper markets were not available, VF has a total of $1.3 billion of liquidity available under its domestic and international revolving bank credit agreements that do not expire until October 2012. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. We regularly assess and manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or (iii) the use of derivative financial instruments. Some of our potential risks are discussed below: Insured risks We self insure a substantial portion of our employee group medical, workers compensation, vehicle, property, director and officer, and general liability exposures and purchase insurance from highly rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures. Cash and equivalents risks VF had $792.2 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2010, which includes demand deposits, institutional money market funds that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. or foreign governments and short term time deposits of foreign commercial banks. We continually monitor the credit ratings of VFs financial institutions. Similarly, we monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in our defined benefit pension plan portfolio. Defined benefit pension plan risks VF is subject to funding and earnings risks of its defined benefit pension plans. VFs pension plans were substantially fully funded at the end of 2007. At the end of 2010, the plans are underfunded due primarily to substantial investment portfolio losses incurred in 2008 and an increase in projected benefit obligations because of a decline in the discount rate used to value those obligations. Declines in the funded status of our plans were offset in part by VF contributions of over $100 million to the plans during 2010 and over $200 million during 2009, as well as investment performance that has exceeded our actuarial return assumption. Accordingly, at the end of 2010, VF has a $207.4 million liability representing the underfunded status of the plans ($1,211.6 million of plan assets compared with a projected benefit obligation of $1,419.0 million) and a $433.8 million pretax balance in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders Equity. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and future funding requirements. Further, as more fully described in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below, we have begun to take actions that will limit the risk in investments of our domestic defined benefit pension plans and reduce the year to year variability of our domestic plans funded status and resulting pension expense. Interest rate risks We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Since all of our long term debt has fixed interest rates, our interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on our variable rate short term borrowings, which averaged approximately $45 million during 2010. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents. Based on the low levels of 40 Table of Contents variable rate borrowings and the levels of cash equivalents during 2010, the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates would not be significant. Foreign currency exchange rate risks VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2010 were generated in international markets. Most of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where we have operations, there would be a negative impact on VFs operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. We do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar, however we do hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have an international bank credit agreement that provides for up to 250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $334.2 million at December 2010) of euro denominated borrowings. Although there were no borrowings under this agreement during 2010, borrowings under the agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our euro denominated net assets. Net advances to and investments in our foreign businesses in Europe, Latin America and Asia are considered to be long term, and accordingly, foreign currency transaction effects on those long term advances are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders Equity. We do not hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which could impact the U.S. dollar value of those investments. We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and enter into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of our forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VFs cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months (relating to cross border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Currently, we use only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future. For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2010, if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2010, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $80 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would result in an offsetting change in the fair value of the underlying balance sheet positions impacted by the currency rate changes. Counterparty risks VF is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and enter into derivative transactions only with financial institutions with A minus/A3 investment grade credit ratings or better. We continually monitor the credit rating of, and our hedging positions with, each counterparty. Additionally, we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our positions if necessary. We also monitor counterparty risk for derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans. Commodity price risks VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which may impact fabric prices. To manage risks of fabric prices, we negotiate prices for denim and other fabrics in advance when possible. We have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. Deferred compensation and related investment security risks VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans participants are based on the market values of investment funds selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirror the participants investment selections. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to our operating results and financial position. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, we may retain outside specialists to assist us in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Inventories Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style size color stock keeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving or excess or off quality, we estimate their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. Long lived Assets We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. We evaluate fair value using three valuation techniques the replacement cost, market and income methods and weight the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective. Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value, if any. Our amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated 42 Table of Contents amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating expected benefits to be received for customer related intangible assets, we consider historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license related intangible assets, we consider historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on our experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions. We review property and definite lived intangible assets for possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We test for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. We measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset, there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of major trademarks, and goodwill are not subject to amortization. Rather, we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual strategic planning process, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value. Fair value of an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership) from an independent party, and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. If the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit having goodwill using the required two step approach. Our reporting units are either our coalitions or a business unit if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management. Two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of a business unit, including its recorded goodwill, to the fair value of the business unit. We estimate the fair value of a business unit using both income based and market based valuation methods. The principal method used is an income based method in which the business units forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value. In the market based valuation method, the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for (i) a group of comparable public companies and (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. Based on the range of fair values developed from the income and market based methods, we determine the appropriate estimated fair value for the business unit. If the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge, if any. The second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) as if the business unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The income based fair value methodology requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of managements control. At the business unit level, fair value estimation requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit, 43 Table of Contents along with assessment of the business units strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve managements estimates and assumptions regarding: Annual cash flows arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10 year forecast period. The forecast assumes that the business has matured and long term growth levels have been reached by the end of this period. A terminal growth rate for years beyond our initial forecast period. The terminal growth rate is generally comparable to historical growth rates for overall consumer spending and, more specifically, for apparel spending. A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk free rate of return on long term Treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparably sized companies, beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate considers any company specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information. Under the market based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of our business units. In our 2010 evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets, we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill and of trademark intangible assets at our 7 For All Mankind business unit exceeded their respective fair values based on the analysis of current and expected future economic conditions in conjunction with finalizing our strategic plan in the fourth quarter of 2010. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income of $195.2 million to write down the carrying value of the goodwill and $6.6 million to write down the carrying value of the nonamortized trademark intangible assets. Similarly in the prior year, we concluded that the carrying values of goodwill at our Reef, Nautica and lucy business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible assets at our Reef and lucy business units exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our 2009 Consolidated Statement of Income of $101.9 million to write down the carrying value of their goodwill and $20.1 million to write down the carrying value of their trademark intangible assets. The noncash charges of $201.7 million in 2010 and $122.0 million in 2009 did not have a significant impact on our financial position or debt covenants and no impact on our liquidity. The charges were based on estimates and judgments; changes to the fair value assumptions potentially would have resulted in different goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges. See Notes F, G and T of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the impairment charges recorded for these business units. At the date of our most recent impairment test, except for the 7 For All Mankind business unit discussed above and the Splendid and Ella Moss business unit discussed below, the estimated fair value of each of our business units exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 15%, and the estimated fair value of each indefinite lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its respective carrying value by at least 20%. Accordingly, no other goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded. The Splendid and Ella Moss business unit has been part of our Contemporary Brands Coalition since our acquisition of those brands in 2009. The Splendid and Ella Moss brands are premium priced lifestyle brands marketed to upscale department and specialty stores. In addition, the rollout of owned stores is a significant component in the growth model for these brands. Although the Splendid and Ella Moss brands have primarily performed as planned since their acquisition, there has not been significant growth in fair value of the business. Accordingly, at October 3, 2010 (the date of our annual impairment test), the business units fair value was $304.2 million, which exceeded its carrying value by 7%. Goodwill in this business unit was $142.4 million. Further, the estimated fair value of the trademarks of this business unit exceeded their recorded amount ($98.9 million) by 19%. It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or trademark intangible assets in any business unit could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2011 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly 44 Table of Contents traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Stock Options We use a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed an annual review of all assumptions and believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. We based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near the money options on VF Common Stock. We measure historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term. Pension Obligations VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full time domestic employees employed before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining our projected pension benefit liabilities and our annual pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. We annually update participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. We believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate specifically to our U.S. pension plans, which comprise over 90% of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of our combined domestic and international plans.) The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows required to meet our projected benefit obligations. The discount rate reflects the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. Our discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in our U.S. pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service or, if a Moodys rating is not available, bonds rated Aa by two other recognized rating services. From this population of over 600 such bonds having at least $50 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputtable unless with make whole provisions, we exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans 45 Table of Contents projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes our plans distinct liability characteristics. We believe that those Aa rated issues meet the high quality intent of the applicable accounting standards and that our 2010 discount rate of 5.65% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our domestic pension plans. This lower discount rate, compared with the rate of 6.05% at the end of 2009, reflects the general decline in yields of U.S. government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2010. The discount rate for our plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting (i) the higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and (ii) the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investments. Our investment objective is to maximize the long term return through a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of domestic and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income, real estate and commodity securities. We develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment asset classes based on many factors, including recent and historical returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The weighted average projected long term rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long term rate of return actuarial assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 7.75% in 2010 and 8.00% in 2009 and 2008. Although we have not changed the overall target mix of investments, we have over the last two years altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by (i) adding commodities as an asset class, (ii) increasing the allocation to fixed income investments, (iii) reducing the allocation to equity investments and (iv) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments. As the qualified plan becomes more fully funded, our intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments so that the effect of interest rate changes on our plans investments will be better correlated with the benefit obligations the investments are intended to fund. The changes in asset allocation should, over time, reduce the year to year variability of our domestic plans funded status and resulting pension expense. Based on an evaluation of market conditions, projected market returns and planned changes in investment mix, we will continue to use a rate of return assumption of 7.75% for our U.S. plan for 2011. We monitor our plans asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants. The market value of our pension plan investment assets declined significantly in 2008 due to the global credit and financial market crisis, which resulted in the plans being underfunded by over $400 million at the end of 2008. During 2009, the underfunded balance declined to $250.9 million primarily due to $200 million of discretionary VF cash contributions to the domestic plan and investment earnings on plan assets, partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations resulting from a reduction in the discount rate during the year. During 2010, the underfunded status of the plans improved once again due to $100 million of discretionary VF cash contributions and earnings on plan assets, partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations due to a further reduction in the discount rate during the year. The resulting underfunded status of $207.4 million is presented in the 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet as $5.9 million of current liabilities and $201.5 million of noncurrent liabilities. The funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could change significantly in future years depending on investment portfolio performance, the level of VF contributions to the plans, changes in the discount rate used to value projected benefit obligations, or other factors. Differences in any year between actual results and the respective actuarial assumptions (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that years pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the balance sheet. At the end of 2010, there were $433.8 million of pretax deferred actuarial losses that resulted primarily from the substantial investment losses incurred during 2008 and the decline in discount rates over the last two years. These accumulated unrecognized actuarial losses resulted in an after tax amount of $266.1 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy is to amortize any 46 Table of Contents unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to future years pension expense as follows: amounts which exceed 20% of beginning of the year projected benefit obligations are amortized over five years; amounts between the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or plan assets and 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active participants; and amounts less than the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized. Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was $67.6 million in 2010, $98.0 million in 2009 and $10.8 million in 2008. This compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees (commonly called service cost) of $18.1 million in 2010 and an average of $16.5 million per year over the last three years. Pension expense for 2010 and 2009 was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those years included the cost of amortizing the higher level of unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Looking forward, we expect our 2011 pension expense to decrease to approximately $50 million due to an increase in plan assets at the end of 2010. The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2010 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2010, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Projected Dollars in millions Pension Expense Benefit Obligations 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 14 $ 85 0.50% increase in discount rate (14 ) (80 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 5 0.50% increase in expected investment return (5 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (2 ) (6 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 1 6 As previously mentioned, we made a $100 million and a $200 million discretionary contribution to our domestic qualified pension plans during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future funding obligations for our defined benefit plans depend on funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations, the interest rates used to determine those funding requirements and future performance of the plans investment portfolio. VF is not required under applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a contribution to its domestic qualified pension plan during 2011 but does intend to make cash contributions totaling approximately $11 million during 2011 to its other pension plans. We believe that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to our pension plans in future years. We have taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in our pension plans and their impact on our financial statements. Beginning in 2005, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after 2004, plus employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, participate in a defined contribution plan with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. As discussed in previous paragraphs, we made significant cash contributions to return the plans to a more fully funded status and have modified our investment strategy for plan assets. Finally, we have begun settling some participants accrued obligations by allowing a lump sum distribution election. On a longer term basis, we believe the year to year variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease. Income Taxes As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation and significant management judgment. VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential issues under the more 47 Table of Contents likely than not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent we are required to pay amounts greater than the established valuation allowances. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. We have recorded $178.7 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and we have recorded $137.2 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If we believe that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. In addition, we have recorded $12.7 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. If in a future period we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period. We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that period. Non GAAP Financial Information VF is a global company that reports financial information in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. These exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results and, accordingly, can affect the comparability of reported results. To better explain our operating results, we use constant currency information, which excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates, to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods. Accordingly, we have provided supplemental constant currency financial information, which is a non GAAP financial measure, in the Analysis of Results of Operations section. Constant currency information represents the current year reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation effects of changes in exchange rates. To calculate Coalition Revenues on a constant currency basis, revenues for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period). 48 Table of Contents We believe the following supplemental constant currency financial information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses: Year Ended December 2010 Exclude Impact of Foreign Constant In millions As Reported Currency Exchange Currency Coalition Revenues Outdoor Action Sports $ 3,205 $ (31 ) $ 3,236 Jeanswear 2,538 9 2,529 Imagewear 909 5 904 Sportswear 498 498 Contemporary Brands 439 (5 ) 444 Other 114 1 113 Total coalition revenues $ 7,703 $ (21 ) $ 7,724 Year Ended December 2009 Exclude Impact of Foreign Constant In millions As Reported Currency Exchange Currency Coalition Revenues Outdoor Action Sports $ 2,806 $ (76 ) $ 2,882 Jeanswear 2,522 (77 ) 2,599 Imagewear 865 865 Sportswear 498 498 Contemporary Brands 418 (3 ) 421 Other 110 110 Total coalition revenues $ 7,220 $ (156 ) $ 7,376 (Above amounts may not add due to rounding.)

Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1A. of this Annual Report.
