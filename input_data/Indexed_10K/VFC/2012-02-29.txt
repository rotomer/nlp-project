Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview VF Corporation (VF) is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Managements vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have greater opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in many product categories. VF has a broad customer base, and distributes products through leading specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus direct to consumer channels. VFs businesses are grouped by product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for internal financial reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses within VF are referred to as coalitions and are the basis for VFs reportable business segments, as described below: Coalition Principal Brands Outdoor & Action Sports The North Face&reg;, Vans&reg;, Timberland&reg;, JanSport&reg;, Kipling&reg; (outside North America), Napapijri&reg;, Reef&reg;, Eastpak&reg;, lucy&reg;, Eagle Creek&reg;, SmartWool&reg; Jeanswear Wrangler&reg;, Lee&reg;, Riders&reg;, Rustler&reg;, Timber Creek by Wrangler&reg; Imagewear Red Kap&reg;, Bulwark&reg;, Majestic&reg; Sportswear Nautica&reg;, Kipling&reg; (within North America) Contemporary Brands 7 For All Mankind&reg;, John Varvatos&reg;, Splendid&reg;, Ella Moss&reg; Highlights of 2011 On September 13, 2011, VF acquired The Timberland Company (Timberland) for $2.3 billion. This acquisition is the largest in VFs history and added the Timberland&reg; and SmartWool&reg; brands to VFs portfolio. 2011 revenues grew to a record $9,459.2 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year, comprised of 14% organic growth and 9% growth from the addition of Timberland. 29 International revenues grew 41% over the prior year and accounted for 34% of total revenues compared with 30% in 2010. With more than half of its revenues from international markets, the Timberland acquisition accounted for 17 percentage points of the total international revenue growth in 2011. VFs businesses in Asia continued to experience significant growth, with revenues up 64% over the prior year, comprised of 38% organic growth and 26% growth from the addition of Timberland. Direct to consumer revenues increased 29% over 2010 and accounted for 19% of VFs total revenues. The Timberland acquisition accounted for approximately one half of the direct to consumer revenue growth in 2011. Adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $8.20 in 2011 from $6.46 in 2010. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share increased over 54% to a record $7.98 in 2011 from $5.18 in 2010. (All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.) Cash flow from operations reached a record $1,081.4 million in 2011. VF issued $900.0 million of term debt along with short term borrowings and cash on hand to fund the Timberland acquisition. The term debt is comprised of $500.0 million of 3.50% fixed rate notes due in 2021 and $400.0 million of floating rate notes due in 2013. The floating rate notes bear interest at the three month LIBOR rate, plus .75%. All of the short term borrowings related to the Timberland acquisition were repaid by year end, and the debt to total capital ratio was 32% at year end. VF increased the quarterly dividend rate by 14%, which marks the 39th consecutive year of increase in dividends paid per share. During the fourth quarter of 2011, VF purchased the remaining interest in its joint venture in India. Adjusted Amounts Excluding Timberland Acquisition Expenses and Impairment Charges The discussions in this section refer to adjusted amounts that exclude transaction and restructuring expenses related to the Timberland acquisition in 2011 and impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in 2010. Management believes that this adjusted information is a relevant measurement of our operating financial performance. Refer to the Non GAAP Financial Information section below for further discussion and a reconciliation of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts. All numbers herein are reported under GAAP unless noted otherwise. Analysis of Results of Operations Consolidated Statements of Income The following table presents a summary of the changes in Total Revenues during the last two years: In millions 2011Compared with2010 2010Compared with2009 Total revenues prior year $ 7,702.6 $ 7,220.3 Organic growth 938.5 462.9 Acquisition in current year 712.9 28.2 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 5.4 12.5 Impact of foreign currency translation 99.8 (21.3 ) Total revenues current year $ 9,459.2 $ 7,702.6 Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues grew 23% in 2011 over 2010 with a 42% increase in the Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, driven by organic growth and 30 the Timberland acquisition. Revenues in the Imagewear and Contemporary Brands businesses grew 13% and 11%, respectively, over the 2010 levels. Sportswear revenues in 2011 grew 9% over the prior year, and Jeanswear revenues increased 8%. Revenues in 2010 increased 7% over 2009 with 14% growth in the Outdoor & Action Sports businesses. Revenues also increased in most other businesses in 2010, but not to the same extent as the Outdoor & Action Sports businesses. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled Information by Business Segment. Translating a foreign entitys financial statements from its functional currency into the U.S. dollar, VFs reporting currency, has an impact on VFs reported operating results. A weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies of those countries where VF conducts its international business (primarily in Europe/euro based countries) positively impacted revenue comparisons by $100 million in 2011 relative to 2010, while a stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue comparisons by $21 million in 2010 relative to 2009. The weighted average translation rates for the euro were $1.39, $1.33 and $1.39 per euro for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. If the U.S. dollar remains at the exchange rate in effect at the end of December 2011 ($1.30 per euro), reported revenues in 2012 will be negatively impacted compared with 2011. The following table presents the percentage relationship to Total Revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income: 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 45.8 % 46.7 % 44.3 % Marketing, administrative and general expenses 32.6 33.4 32.4 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 2.6 1.7 Operating income 13.2 % 10.7 % 10.2 % The 0.9% decline in gross margin rate in 2011 from 2010 was driven by a 1.9% net negative impact from higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases, which was partially offset by an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses, including the Outdoor & Action Sports, international and direct to consumer businesses. In addition, the 2011 gross margin benefited by 0.3% from (i) the gain on closure of a European jeanswear facility in the second quarter of 2011, (ii) restructuring expenses incurred during the first quarter of 2010 to reduce product costs that did not recur in 2011 and (iii) the change in inventory accounting policy discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The gross margin rate expanded 2.4% in 2010 over 2009, with approximately 1.3% of the improvement due to (i) an increased percentage of revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses, including the Outdoor & Action Sports, international and direct to consumer operations, and (ii) other areas of operational improvements, including retail and inventory efficiencies. The remaining 1.1% improvement resulted from product cost reductions. The lower ratio of Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percentage of Total Revenues in 2011, compared with 2010, was driven by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. The 2011 ratio also included 0.4% of one time expenses related to the Timberland acquisition. Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues increased 1.0% in 2010 over 2009 due to increased marketing spending in 2010 and 0.4% due to stronger growth in the direct to consumer business, which has a higher expense ratio to revenues than the wholesale business. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic pension expense, which reduced the ratio by 0.6% in 2010 compared with 2009. Operating margins increased to 13.2% in 2011 from 10.7% in 2010. Adjusted operating margins were 13.5% in 2011 vs. 13.3% in 2010. 31 VF completed its annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2011 as part of its strategic planning process. This assessment considered current and expected economic conditions, trends and forecasted business unit cash flows, and assumptions representative of those that market participants would make in valuing VFs business units. Based on the results of this testing, VF management concluded that no impairment charges were required in 2011. As a result of an impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2010, VF management determined that the carrying values of its goodwill and trademark intangible assets at its 7 For All Mankind&reg; business unit exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, VF recorded a noncash impairment charge in 2010 totaling $201.7 million ($141.8 million net of related income tax benefits) to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and the trademark intangible assets to their fair values. This charge represented all of the recorded goodwill for the 7 For All Mankind&reg; business unit and 40% of the combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark balances for this business unit. Similarly, as a result of VFs annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2009, VF management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at its Reef&reg;, lucy&reg; and Nautica&reg; business units and trademark intangible assets at its Reef&reg; and lucy&reg; business units exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, VF recorded noncash impairment charges in 2009 totaling $122.0 million ($114.4 million net of related income tax benefits) to reduce these carrying values to their fair values. Of this total, Reef&reg; represented $36.7 million, lucy&reg; represented $26.8 million and Nautica&reg; represented $58.5 million (23%, 26% and 14%, respectively, of each businesses combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible asset balances). For additional information, see Notes F, G and T to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below. Net interest expense decreased $2.6 million in 2011 from 2010 due primarily to (i) the repayment of $200.0 million of long term notes that matured in late 2010 and (ii) higher interest rates earned on cash and equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, offset by incremental interest expense on short and long term borrowings to fund the Timberland acquisition. Net interest expense decreased $8.3 million in 2010 from 2009 due to reduced short term borrowing levels and the repayment of $200.0 million of notes that matured in 2010. Average interest bearing debt outstanding totaled $1,656 million for 2011, $1,136 million for 2010, and $1,364 million for 2009, with Short term Borrowings representing 24.0%, 4.0% and 16.2% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 4.5% for 2011, 6.6% for 2010 and 6.1% for 2009. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate in 2011 resulted from the issuance of new long term notes, commercial paper and borrowings under the international facility, all bearing lower interest rates than prior issuances. The increase in the weighted average interest rate in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a reduction in commercial paper borrowings, which bear lower interest rates. VF recognized a $5.7 million gain in Miscellaneous Income during 2010 from remeasuring the previous 50% investment in the Vans Mexico joint venture upon acquiring the remaining 50% interest. The remainder of the increase in Miscellaneous, Net expense in 2011 over 2010 was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses. The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 23.6%, which included $14.3 million in net tax benefit related to settlements of prior years tax audits and prior years tax filings, $9.4 million of tax benefit related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations and $16.6 million in income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances in foreign jurisdictions. These items together lowered the 2011 annual tax rate by 3.5%. In addition, the 2011 effective income tax rate benefited from a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2010 and 2009. During 2011, the international effective tax rate was approximately 10.2%. The tax rates for 2009 and 2010 (excluding impairment charges) were 26.2% and 24.9%, respectively. During 2009, VF recorded a tax benefit of $17.5 million related to favorable outcomes of U.S. state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of limitations in several U.S. state and international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded. These items lowered the 2009 annual tax rate by 2.3%. During 32 2010, VF recorded $20.5 million of tax benefit related to prior years refund claims and tax credits and $5.6 million of tax benefit related to expirations of statutes of limitations in international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had been recorded. These items together lowered the 2010 annual tax rate by 2.7%. The 2010 effective income tax rate benefited from a higher percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2009. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation for 2011 increased to $888.1 million ($7.98 per share), compared with $571.4 million ($5.18 per share) in 2010. Adjusted earnings per share were $8.20 in 2011 and $6.46 in 2010, an increase of 27%. The increase in earnings per share in 2011 resulted from improved operating performance, as discussed in the Information by Business Segment section below. In addition, earnings per share in 2011 benefited by (i) $0.38 per share from the Timberland acquisition (which included $0.22 per share in acquisition related expenses), (ii) $0.14 per share from the impact of foreign currency translation, (iii) $0.09 per share in restructuring expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2010 that did not recur in 2011, (iv) $0.07 per share from the gain on a facility closure and (v) $0.04 per share from a change in inventory accounting. Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation increased to $571.4 million in 2010 from $461.3 million in 2009, while earnings per share increased to $5.18 in 2010 from $4.13 in 2009. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.46 in 2010 and $5.16 in 2009. The increase in earnings per share in 2010 over 2009 resulted from improved operating performance, as discussed in the Information by Business Segment section below, and lower domestic pension expense, which benefited earnings per share in 2010 by $0.20. These benefits were partially offset by cost reduction actions that negatively impacted earnings per share in 2010 by $0.09. Information by Business Segment Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income, hereinafter termed Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit, respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based on available opportunities and analysis of Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or number of employees. The following tables present a summary of the changes in Total Revenues and Coalition Profit by coalition during the last two years: In millions Outdoor& ActionSports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear ContemporaryBrands Other Total Coalition Revenues 2009 $ 2,806.1 $ 2,522.5 $ 865.5 $ 498.3 $ 417.7 $ 110.2 $ 7,220.3 Organic growth (decline) 401.5 5.8 38.6 (0.5 ) 13.4 4.1 462.9 Acquisition in current year 28.2 28.2 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 12.5 12.5 Impact of foreign currency translation (31.1 ) 9.3 5.3 (4.9 ) 0.1 (21.3 ) Coalition Revenues 2010 3,204.7 2,537.6 909.4 497.8 438.7 114.4 7,702.6 Organic growth (decline) 570.2 171.3 112.5 45.7 41.6 (2.8 ) 938.5 Acquisition in current year 712.9 712.9 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 5.4 5.4 Impact of foreign currency translation 68.8 22.9 3.3 4.8 99.8 Coalition Revenues 2011 $ 4,562.0 $ 2,731.8 $ 1,025.2 $ 543.5 $ 485.1 $ 111.6 $ 9,459.2 33 In millions Outdoor& ActionSports Jeanswear Imagewear Sportswear ContemporaryBrands Other Total Coalition Profit 2009 $ 492.9 $ 370.9 $ 87.5 $ 52.0 $ 50.8 $ 1.2 $ 1,055.3 Organic growth (decline) 141.6 54.9 22.9 0.4 (37.6 ) (1.3 ) 180.9 Acquisition in current year 6.4 6.4 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 1.9 1.9 Impact of foreign currency translation (4.2 ) 6.1 0.8 (1.1 ) 0.1 1.7 Coalition Profit 2010 636.7 431.9 111.2 52.4 14.0 1,246.2 Organic growth (decline) 105.8 (22.0 ) 33.7 3.9 21.8 (1.1 ) 142.1 Acquisition in current year 71.6 71.6 Acquisition in prior year (to anniversary date) 0.6 0.6 Impact of foreign currency translation 13.5 3.3 0.8 0.1 17.7 Coalition Profit 2011 $ 828.2 $ 413.2 $ 145.7 $ 56.3 $ 35.9 $ (1.1 ) $ 1,478.2 The following section discusses changes in revenues and profitability by coalition: Outdoor & Action Sports: PercentChange Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Coalition Revenues $ 4,562.0 $ 3,204.7 $ 2,806.1 42.4 % 14.2 % Coalition Profit 828.2 636.7 492.9 30.1 % 29.2 % Operating Margin 18.2 % 19.9 % 17.6 % This coalition consists of VFs outdoor and action sports related businesses, including The North Face&reg;, Vans&reg;, Timberland&reg;, Kipling&reg;, SmartWool&reg;, JanSport&reg;, Eastpak&reg;, Napapijri&reg;, Reef&reg;, lucy&reg; and Eagle Creek&reg;. The Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition achieved record revenues and operating income in 2011. Global revenues for this coalition increased 42% over 2010, reflecting 20% organic growth and 22% growth from the Timberland acquisition. Outdoor & Action Sports revenues in the Americas increased 31% over 2010 and international revenues rose 63%, with approximately one half of the growth in each of the geographies coming from the Timberland acquisition. Of the 30% increase in international organic revenues, 6% was attributable to foreign currency translation. Nearly all Outdoor & Action Sports brands achieved double digit growth in the year, with the two largest brands The North Face&reg; and Vans&reg; achieving global revenue growth of 21% and 23%, respectively. In addition, revenues of the Kipling&reg;, Eastpak&reg;, Reef&reg; and Napapijri&reg; brands increased 24%, 21%, 17% and 15%, respectively. Coalition revenues in Asia increased 93%, with over 50 percentage points of the growth due to the Timberland acquisition. Direct to consumer revenues in the coalition rose 44% in 2011 over 2010 with approximately 25 percentage points of the increase from the Timberland acquisition. Direct to consumer revenue growth was also driven by new store openings, comp store revenue growth and an expanding e commerce business with increases of 26% and 17% in The North Face&reg; and Vans&reg; direct to consumer businesses, respectively. The 14% increase in revenues in 2010 over 2009 was driven by growth in The North Face&reg; and Vans&reg; brands of 18% and 20%, respectively. These brands experienced growth in both domestic and international markets. Direct to consumer revenues for this coalition rose 20% in 2010 over 2009, with double digit growth in 34 The North Face&reg;, Vans&reg;, Kipling&reg;, Napapijri&reg; and lucy&reg; retail businesses as the coalition benefited from new store openings, growth in comp store sales and expansion of the e commerce business. Revenues in Asia increased 31% in 2010 over the prior year. Operating margin declined in 2011, compared with 2010, due primarily to the Timberland acquisition. Excluding the operating results of Timberland and its acquisition related expenses, operating margin in 2011 was 19.7%, compared with 19.9% in 2010. The operating margin improvement in 2010 over 2009 was driven by (i) a 2.5% increase in gross margin, reflecting improvements in retail store performance and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories, and (ii) leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. These operating margin improvements were partially offset by a significant increase in marketing spending that negatively impacted operating margin comparisons by 1.2% in 2010 compared with 2009. Jeanswear: PercentChange Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Coalition Revenues $ 2,731.8 $ 2,537.6 $ 2,522.5 7.7 % 0.6 % Coalition Profit 413.2 431.9 370.9 (4.3 )% 16.5 % Operating Margin 15.1 % 17.0 % 14.7 % The Jeanswear Coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler&reg; and Lee&reg; brands. Domestic jeanswear revenues increased 4% in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing contributing to 8% revenue growth, offset by a 4% reduction in unit volumes. The domestic jeanswear growth was led by increases in the western and Lee&reg; businesses of 11% and 8%, respectively. Mass market revenues in 2011 were flat with 2010 levels. International jeanswear revenue growth in 2011 was 17%, of which 3% was due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Asia revenues rose by 37%, and Mexico, Canada and Latin America each had double digit growth. European jeanswear revenues increased 6%, with approximately two thirds of the increase attributable to favorable foreign currency translation. Domestic jeanswear revenues increased 2% in 2010 over 2009, with 3% growth in both the Wrangler&reg; and Lee&reg; brands reflecting the positive impact of new products introduced during the year. International jeanswear revenues, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, declined 3% in 2010, with lower revenues in Europe partially offset by 36% revenue growth in Asia and double digit growth in all other foreign markets. The decline in Europe resulted primarily from the decision in 2009 to exit the mass market jeans business in Europe, as well as continued difficult business conditions in the overall European jeanswear market. The decline in operating margin in 2011 from 2010 was driven by higher product costs that were not fully offset by pricing increases within the domestic jeanswear businesses. The operating margin in 2011 benefited by 0.4% from the gain on a facility closure in 2011 and 0.4% from restructuring expenses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011. The improvement in operating margin in 2010 over 2009 resulted from a 2.6% higher gross margin reflecting (i) lower product costs, particularly in the U.S. jeanswear businesses, and (ii) lower levels of and improved profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories. Operating margin comparisons in 2010 also benefited from the 2009 exit of the European mass market jeans business, which had operating margins that were well below the coalition average. These benefits were partially offset by increased marketing spending and charges for cost reduction actions that negatively impacted 2010 operating margin comparisons by 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. 35 Imagewear: PercentChange Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 20110 Coalition Revenues $ 1,025.2 $ 909.4 $ 865.5 12.7 % 5.1 % Coalition Profit 145.7 111.2 87.5 31.1 % 27.1 % Operating Margin 14.2 % 12.2 % 10.1 % The Imagewear Coalition consists of VFs Image business (occupational apparel and uniforms) and Licensed Sports business (licensed high profile athletic apparel). Image business revenues increased 19% in 2011 over 2010, driven by strength in the protective apparel and industrial uniform business. Revenues in the Licensed Sports business rose 6% due to continued growth in the National Football League licensed apparel business, including positive response to an expanded womens apparel offering. Image business revenues increased 8% in 2010 over 2009 due to strength in the industrial and protective sectors resulting from the gradual economic recovery and the competitive advantage of its quick response service model. Licensed Sports revenues increased 3% in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to growth in the licensed National Football League business. The improvement in operating margin in 2011 over 2010 resulted from a more favorable mix of business, which led to a higher gross margin of 0.8%, and leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. Operating margin increased 1.5% in 2010 over 2009 due to a higher gross margin, resulting primarily from an improved mix of business. The remainder of the increase was driven by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues.

Nautica&reg; brand revenues increased 5% in 2011 over 2010 with unit pricing driving the majority of the growth. Revenues increased in both the Nautica&reg; mens wholesale sportswear and direct to consumer businesses. Kipling&reg; brand revenues increased 56%, reflecting significant increases in both the wholesale and direct to consumer businesses. Sportswear Coalition Revenues were flat in 2010 compared with 2009. A 2% decline in Nautica&reg; brand revenues during 2010 due to lower volume in owned outlet stores was offset by 30% growth in Kipling&reg; brand revenues, reflecting significant increases in both the wholesale and direct to consumer businesses. Operating margin was flat in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the impact of higher product costs being offset by (i) a higher percentage of Kipling&reg; revenues, which have higher margins than the coalition average and (ii) leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues. 36 Operating margin was flat in 2010 compared with 2009. Gross margin improved by 0.7% due to (i) lower markdown activity in the department and outlet store channels, (ii) lower levels of excess inventory coming into 2010 and (iii) a higher percentage of Kipling&reg; revenues, which have stronger margins than the coalition average. The gross margin improvement was offset by increased marketing spending. Contemporary Brands: PercentChange Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Coalition Revenues $ 485.1 $ 438.7 $ 417.7 10.6 % 5.0 % Coalition Profit 35.9 14.0 50.8 156.4 % (72.4 )% Operating Margin 7.4 % 3.2 % 12.2 % This coalition consists of the 7 For All Mankind&reg; brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel, the John Varvatos&reg; luxury apparel collection for men and the Splendid&reg; and Ella Moss&reg; apparel brands. Domestic and international revenues rose 11% and 8% in 2011 over 2010, respectively, with double digit revenue growth in the Splendid&reg;, Ella Moss&reg; and John Varvatos&reg; brands. Global 7 For All Mankind&reg; revenues increased 4% in 2011 over 2010, with growth both domestically and internationally. New stores, comp store revenue growth and higher e commerce revenues drove 34% growth in direct to consumer revenues for this coalition in 2011. The growth in Coalition Revenues in 2010 resulted from the 2009 acquisition of the Splendid&reg; and Ella Moss&reg; brands, which contributed an incremental $24 million in revenues in 2010, and 10% revenue growth in the John Varvatos&reg; business. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decrease in global 7 For All Mankind&reg; brand revenues, reflecting volume declines due to challenging conditions in the premium denim market. The improvement in operating margin in 2011 compared with 2010 resulted from (i) a lower, more normalized volume of distressed inventory sales, (ii) the write off of fixtures at eight underperforming stores in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 and (iii) strong comp store sales performance. These increases were partially offset by investments in new retail stores and increased marketing spending. The decline in operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 was driven by (i) investments in new 7 For All Mankind&reg; retail stores, (ii) increased marketing spending, (iii) the write off of fixtures at eight underperforming retail stores that had been opened in previous years, (iv) higher volumes of distressed inventory sales, at lower gross margin, and (v) the favorable resolution of a value added tax and duty matter during 2009 that did not recur in 2010. These decreases were partially offset by improved operating results in the John Varvatos&reg; business, which had a positive operating margin in 2010 as compared with operating losses in all prior years. Other: PercentChange Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 Revenues $ 111.6 $ 114.4 $ 110.2 (2.5 )% 3.8 % Profit (1.1 ) 1.2 Operating Margin (1.0 )% 0.0 % 1.1 % VF operates outlet stores in the United States that sell VF and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition, while revenues and profits of non VF products are reported in this Other category. Revenues and profit in the Other business segment for 2011 were flat with both 2010 and 2009. 37 Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes: There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to Income Before Income Taxes. These costs are as follows: Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks and Interest Expense, Net were discussed in the previous Consolidated Statements of Income section. Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks is excluded from Coalition Profit as it represents charges that are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses. See the Non GAAP Financial Information section below. Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management. Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters and similar costs that are not apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows: In millions 2011 2010 2009 Information systems and shared services $ 200.9 $ 185.2 $ 164.7 Less costs apportioned to coalitions (151.2 ) (143.7 ) (143.7 ) 49.7 41.5 21.0 Corporate headquarters costs 124.5 110.9 72.6 Trademark maintenance and enforcement 16.1 12.1 11.1 Other 50.4 54.3 90.3 Corporate and Other Expenses $ 240.7 $ 218.8 $ 195.0 Information Systems and Shared Services Include the costs of management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources and customer management functions that support worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The increase in information systems and shared services costs in 2011 from 2010 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses, increased spending related to reconfiguring the Western Hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated with changing third party data center providers. Corporate Headquarters Costs Headquarters costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The increase in corporate headquarters costs in 2011 over 2010 resulted from expenses associated with the Timberland acquisition and higher levels of corporate spending to support overall business growth. The increase in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, increased contributions to the VF Foundation and higher investments in strategy and innovation. Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement Include legal and other costs associated with registering, maintaining and enforcing the majority of VFs trademarks, plus the costs of licensing administration. These costs are controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions. The increase in expenses in 2011 over 2010 resulted from foreign currency exchange losses on hedging contracts related to royalty arrangements. Other This category includes (i) costs that result from corporate programs or corporate managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management reporting, (ii) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial reporting (prior to 2011) and (iii) other consolidating adjustments, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VFs centrally managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Coalition Profit of the business units includes only their current year service cost component of pension expense. Pension costs totaling $33.8 million for 2011, $46.9 million for 2010 and $83.1 million in 2009, 38 primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial losses, were recorded in other expenses above. Other Expenses in 2011 were reduced by $8.0 million from an inventory accounting change from LIFO to FIFO and in 2010 were reduced by a $5.7 million gain related to the acquisition of Vans Mexico. See also Notes A and Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Analysis of Financial Condition Balance Sheets The Timberland acquisition significantly impacted the December 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, the table below presents the December 2011 balance sheet accounts excluding the Timberland balances at that date so that the remaining VF balances are comparable with the December 2010 balances. December 2011 In millions As Reported Timberland VF excludingTimberland December2010 Accounts Receivable $ 1,120.2 $ 228.9 $ 891.3 $ 773.1 Inventories 1,453.6 250.9 1,202.7 1,070.7 Other Current Assets 166.1 23.2 142.9 121.8 Property, Plant and Equipment 737.5 82.1 655.4 602.9 Intangible Assets and Goodwill 4,981.9 2,410.2 2,571.7 2,657.6 Short term Borrowings 281.7 281.7 36.6 Accounts Payable 637.1 76.0 561.1 511.0 Accrued Liabilities 744.5 141.1 603.4 559.2 Total Long term Debt 1,834.5 1,834.5 938.6 Other Liabilities 1,290.1 669.6 620.5 550.9 Unless noted otherwise, the discussion that follows relates to VFs businesses excluding the Timberland balances at December 2011. Accounts Receivable at December 2011 increased over December 2010 due to significant growth in wholesale revenues near the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, there was a slight increase in days sales outstanding compared with the prior year, reflecting a higher percentage of revenues in international jurisdictions where payment terms are substantially longer than those of the U.S. businesses. Inventories increased 12% at December 2011 over December 2010, with 9 percentage points of the increase due to higher product costs and expected revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the prior year period. Other Current Assets at December 2011 increased over December 2010 due primarily to higher levels of unrealized gains on hedging contracts. Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of 2011 was higher than at December 2010, as a result of capital spending in excess of depreciation expense. Total Intangible Assets and Goodwill decreased at December 2011 from December 2010 due to the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency translation. Short term Borrowings were $281.7 million at December 2011, as compared to $36.6 million at December 2010, due to the use of funds associated with the Timberland acquisition and to support the overall growth of VFs businesses. See the Liquidity and Cash Flows section below. The increase in Accounts Payable at December 2011 compared with December 2010 resulted from the timing of inventory purchases and other payments. 39 The increase in Accrued Liabilities at December 2011 over December 2010 was driven primarily by overall growth of VFs businesses. Long term Debt at December 2011 increased from December 2010 due to the issuance of $900.0 million of term debt to provide funding for the Timberland acquisition. Other Liabilities increased at December 2011 from December 2010 due to an increase in the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2011, as discussed in the following paragraph, partially offset by lower deferred income tax liabilities. The funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants. The underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans, recorded in Other Liabilities, was $402.7 million at the end of 2011, compared with $207.4 million at the end of 2010. The funded status declined in 2011 because the plans projected benefit obligations grew, primarily due to a decline in the discount rate used to value those liabilities, while there was little earnings growth in the plans assets. See the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below and Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of liability and equity balances related to defined benefit pension plans. Liquidity and Cash Flows The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following: Dollars in millions 2011 2010 Working capital $ 1,521.9 $ 1,716.6 Current ratio 1.9 to 1 2.5 to 1 Debt to total capital 31.9 % 20.2 % For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short term and long term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders equity. The ratio of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents and total capital defined as net debt plus stockholders equity, was 28.2% at the end of 2011. VFs primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of Net Income, changes in accounts receivable, investments in inventories and changes in other working capital components. Cash flow from operations was $1,081.4 million in 2011, $1,001.3 million in 2010 and $973.5 million in 2009. Net Income was $890.4 million, $573.5 million and $458.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net Income in 2010 and 2009 was negatively impacted by noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of $201.7 million and $122.0 million, respectively. Operating cash flow for 2010 and 2009 included $100.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, of discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, which reduced cash flow from operating activities during those periods. There were no discretionary contributions to this plan in 2011. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future pension funding requirements. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, resulted in a $165.1 million net usage of cash in 2011, compared with cash generation of $90.4 million and $228.1 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The net usage of cash in 2011 was primarily driven by increased accounts receivable balances at the end of 2011 as discussed in the Balance Sheets section above. Net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in 2010 was due to higher accruals for incentive compensation and other liabilities resulting from business growth in 2010. Net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in 2009 was driven by (i) a significant reduction in inventory levels, (ii) the sale of accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph below and (iii) a reduction in other current assets during 2009 resulting from prepaid income taxes being unusually high at the end of 2008. 40 VF has an agreement with a financial institution to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis. This agreement allows VF to have up to $237.5 million of accounts receivable held by the financial institution at any point in time. At the end of December 2011 and 2010, accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets had been reduced by $115.4 million, and $112.3 million, respectively, related to balances sold under this program. The sale of accounts receivable under this agreement increased operating cash flow by $3.1 million, $38.1 million and $74.2 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash used for investing activities in the last three years related primarily to acquisitions and capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $170.9 million in 2011, compared with $111.6 million in 2010, and $85.9 million in 2009. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to retail store rollout, distribution network and information systems costs. VF expects that capital spending could reach $375 million in 2012 to support continued growth, including new headquarters for the Outdoor & Action Sports businesses in the United States and Europe, new distribution centers across the globe and continued store growth. This spending will be funded by cash flow from operations. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash balances in the acquired companies, was $2,265.2 million, $38.3 million and $212.3 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2011 acquisition of Timberland was funded by the issuance of $900.0 million of term debt, together with cash on hand and short term borrowings. The 2010 and 2009 acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances. VF relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances, credit facilities and strong credit rating. In December 2011, VF entered into a new credit facility that provides a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit through December 2016 (the Global Credit Facility). The Global Credit Facility replaced the previous $1.0 billion senior domestic unsecured revolving facility and the 250.0 million senior international unsecured revolving facility. The Global Credit Facility also supports VFs issuance of up to $1.25 billion of commercial paper for short term seasonal working capital requirements. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 2011 were $247.1 million. At the end of December 2011, $1,228.9 million was available for borrowing under the Global Credit Facility; there was $21.1 million of standby letters of credit issued against the Global Credit Facility on VFs behalf. In August 2011, VF issued $900.0 million of term debt to provide funding for the Timberland acquisition. The debt was comprised of $500.0 million of 3.50% fixed rate notes due in 2021 and $400.0 million of floating rate notes due in 2013. The floating rate notes bear interest at the three month LIBOR rate plus .75%, which resets quarterly. VFs liquidity position is also enhanced by its favorable credit agency ratings, which allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates. At the end of 2011, VFs long term debt ratings were A minus by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and A3 by Moodys Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings were A 2 and Prime 2, respectively, by those rating agencies. Moodys maintains a stable outlook for VF and Standard & Poors has a negative outlook as a result of VFs acquisition of Timberland. None of VFs long term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2013, 2017, 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, VF purchased 0.1 million, 5.1 million and 1.6 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The respective cost was $7.4 million, $411.8 million and $112.0 million with an average price of $99.80 in 2011, $81.11 in 2010 and $71.80 in 2009. Shares repurchased in 2011 were less than prior years due to the funding of the Timberland acquisition. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an additional 6.5 million shares. VF will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions, Common Stock price and levels of stock option exercises. 41 Cash dividends totaled $2.61 per common share in 2011, compared with $2.43 in 2010 and $2.37 in 2009. The dividend payout rate was 32.7% of diluted earnings per share in 2011, 46.9% in 2010 and 57.4% in 2009. On a longer term basis, VF expects to pay annual dividends of approximately 40% of diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2012 is $2.88 per share. As of December 2011, approximately $57 million of cash and short term investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. VFs intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, VF would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. Following is a summary of VFs contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2011 that will require the use of funds: Payments Due or Forecasted by Period In millions Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Recorded liabilities: Long term debt(1) $ 1,843 $ 3 $ 403 $ 3 $ 3 $ 13 $ 1,418 Other(2) 513 88 92 61 48 45 179 Unrecorded commitments: Interest payment obligations(3) 1,445 80 78 75 75 74 1,063 Operating leases(4) 1,201 275 220 182 154 116 254 Minimum royalty payments(5) 311 64 78 80 29 31 29 Inventory obligations(6) 1,297 1,259 15 15 8 Other obligations(7) 255 196 33 19 5 2 Total $ 6,865 $ 1,965 $ 919 $ 435 $ 322 $ 281 $ 2,943 (1) Long term debt consists of required principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations. (2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for other noncurrent liabilities in VFs Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation and other employee related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. (3) Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts exclude bank fees, amortization of a net hedging loss and other deferred costs and accretion of debt discount that would be included in Interest Expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance. These costs are not included above and average approximately 18% of the stated minimum lease payments. Total lease commitments exclude $6.3 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases. (5) Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use the trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum advertising commitments. (6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in Accounts Payable at December 2011 related to inventory purchases. (7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. 42 VF had other financial commitments at the end of 2011 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances: Funding contributions to the defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table because it is uncertain whether or when further contributions will be required. $101.7 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under self insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations. Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments. Management believes that VFs cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. Risk Management VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below: Insured risks VF self insures a substantial portion of employee group medical, workers compensation, vehicle, property, director and officer, and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highly rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures. Cash and equivalents risks VF had $341.2 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2011, which includes demand deposits, institutional money market funds that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or foreign governments and short term time deposits in foreign commercial banks. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income investments in the defined benefit pension plan portfolio. Defined benefit pension plan risks VF has defined benefit pension plans that have risk associated with their investment portfolio. At the end of 2011, VFs pension plans were underfunded by $402.7 million, which is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. VF has made significant cash contributions to improve the funded status of the plans (discretionary contributions of $200.0 million in 2009 and $100.0 million in 2010). VF will continue to evaluate the funded status of the retirement plans and future funding requirements. Future funding obligations for the defined benefit plans depend on funding requirements and future performance of the plans investment portfolio. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years. VFs reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense. Pension expense has ranged from $56.6 million to $98.0 million over the last three years, with the fluctuations due primarily to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses (i.e., differences between actual results incurred and actuarially assumed amounts) that are deferred and amortized to future years expense. These actuarial assumptions include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans and the discount rate used to value participant liabilities. 43 VF has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. Beginning in 2005, VFs domestic defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. As the qualified plan becomes more fully funded, managements intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit payments so that the effect of interest rate changes on the plans investments will be better correlated with the benefit obligations the investments are intended to fund. In addition, VF has begun settling some participants accrued obligations by lump sum distributions. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VFs risks related to its defined benefit plans. Interest rate risks VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. Since a significant portion of VFs long term debt has fixed interest rates, the interest rate exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short term borrowings and the $400.0 million of floating rate notes due 2013, which together averaged $541.0 million outstanding during 2011. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VFs cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2011, the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates would not be significant. Foreign currency exchange rate risks VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 34% of VFs revenues in 2011 were generated in international markets. Most of VFs foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there would be a negative impact on VFs operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. VF does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar; however management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section. The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Most net advances to and investments in VFs foreign businesses in Europe, Latin America and Asia are considered to be long term, and accordingly, foreign currency transaction effects on those long term advances are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders Equity. VF generally does not hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which could cause the U.S. dollar value of those investments to fluctuate. VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions. Use of these financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VFs cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged. VFs practice is to hedge a portion of net foreign currency cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months (relating to cross border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Currently, VF uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future. For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2011, if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2011, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $100 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes. Counterparty risks VF is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit 44 guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with A minus/A3 investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust positions if necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans. Commodity price risks VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments. Deferred compensation and related investment security risks VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans participants are based on the market values of investment funds selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the participants investment selections is hedged by VFs investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirror the participants investment selections. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VFs investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VFs operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VFs business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that an order is placed to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. Management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Inventories VFs inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style size color stock keeping units (SKUs) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to be discontinued products, and off quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase 45 commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow moving, excess or off quality, VF estimates their market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VFs timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. Long lived Assets VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value using three valuation techniques the replacement cost, market and income methods and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective. VFs depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value, if any. VFs amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating expected benefits to be received for customer related intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license related intangible assets, management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions. VF reviews property and definite lived intangible assets for possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. VF tests for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted total of undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset, there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, VF estimates the fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future cash flows and recognizes an impairment charge for the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of major trademarks and trade names, and goodwill are not subject to amortization. Rather, VF evaluates those assets for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of the annual strategic planning process, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value. Fair value of an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership) from an independent party, and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. If the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference. 46 VF assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting unit using the required two step approach. Reporting units are either coalitions or a business unit if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management. Two or more business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics. In the first step of the goodwill impairment test, VF compares the carrying value of a business unit, including its recorded goodwill, to the fair value of the business unit. VF estimates the fair value of a business unit using both income based and market based valuation methods. The principal method used is an income based method in which the business units forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value. In the market based valuation method, the fair value of a business unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for (i) a group of comparable public companies and (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. Based on the range of fair values developed from the income and market based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the business unit. If the fair value of the business unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value, VF performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge, if any. The second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) as if the business unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The income based fair value methodology requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of managements control. At the business unit level, fair value estimation requires managements assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific business unit, along with assessment of the business units strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve managements estimates and assumptions regarding: Annual cash flows arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10 year forecast period. The forecast assumes that the business has matured and long term growth levels have been reached by the end of this period. A terminal growth rate for years beyond the initial forecast period. The terminal growth rate is generally comparable to historical growth rates for overall consumer spending and, more specifically, for apparel spending. A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk free rate of return on long term Treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparably sized companies, beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate considers any company specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information. Under the market based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of VFs business units. At the date of the most recent impairment test, except for the 7 For All Mankind&reg; trademark intangible assets discussed below and the recently acquired Timberland&reg; trademark intangible assets, the estimated fair values of all other indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 30%. In addition, as a result of the goodwill impairment testing in 2011, the fair values of all business units, except for the recently acquired Timberland business, exceeded their respective carrying values by at least 20%. In VFs 2011 evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived trademark intangible assets, management concluded that the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible assets of the 7 For All Mankind&reg; business unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 4%. A portion of the original value of these intangible assets was impaired as part of the 2010 evaluation, which were written down from a book value of $312 million to fair value 47 of $305 million at that time. The financial results for this business in 2011 approximated the planned results, and the expected future growth of the business beyond 2011 has not changed significantly from the prior year analysis. Accordingly, these results are consistent with managements expectation that the fair value of the 7 For All Mankind&reg; trademark intangible assets would slightly exceed the carrying value. All goodwill related to the 7 For All Mankind&reg; business unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis. It is possible that VFs conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any business unit could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2012 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific business unit change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VFs consolidated financial position or results of operations. Stock Options VF uses a lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions and believes that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each option grant are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements. One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management based its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near the money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Managements assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term. Pension Obligations VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full time domestic employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid. VF annually updates participant demographics and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments. Management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modifies them based on current rates and trends. VF also 48 periodically reviews and modifies as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate specifically to the U.S. pension plans, which comprise over 90% of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined domestic and international plans.) The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates. VF selects the discount rate by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in the U.S. pension plans. VF uses the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated Aa by Moodys Investors Service or, if a Moodys rating is not available, bonds rated Aa by two other recognized rating services. From this population of over 500 such bonds having at least $50 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputable unless with make whole provisions, VF excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes the plans distinct liability characteristics. VF believes that those Aa rated issues meet the high quality intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2011 discount rate of 5.10% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the domestic pension plans. This lower discount rate, compared with the rate of 5.65% at the end of 2010, reflects the general decline in yields of U.S. government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2011. The discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting (i) the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and (ii) the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years. Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long term rate of return on investments. VFs investment objective is to maximize the long term return through a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of domestic and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income, real estate and commodity securities. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors, including recent and historical returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The weighted average projected long term rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long term rate of return actuarial assumption. VFs rate of return assumption was 7.75% in both 2011 and 2010 and 8.00% in 2009. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by (i) increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments, (ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and (iii) adding commodities as an asset class. The changes in asset allocation should, over time, reduce the year to year variability of the domestic plans funded status and resulting pension expense. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 7.50% for the U.S. plan for 2012. Management monitors the plans asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk. Differences between actual results and the respective actuarially determined assumed results (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) in a given year do not affect that years pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of 2011, there were $567.9 million of accumulated pretax deferred actuarial losses, plus $15.2 million of deferred prior service costs, resulting in an after tax amount of $356.7 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These deferred losses will be amortized as a component of future years pension expense. 49 Pension expense recognized in the financial statements was $56.6 million in 2011, $67.6 million in 2010 and $98.0 million in 2009. This compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees (commonly called service cost) of $20.9 million in 2011, $18.1 million in 2010 and $14.9 million in 2009. Pension expense for the last three years was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those years included the cost of amortizing prior years unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Looking forward, VF expects 2012 pension expense to increase to approximately $93 million primarily due to an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses. The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2011 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end of 2011, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following: Increase (Decrease) in Projected Dollars in millions Pension Expense Benefit Obligations 0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 14 $ 95 0.50% increase in discount rate (13 ) (89 ) 0.50% decrease in expected investment return 6 0.50% increase in expected investment return (6 ) 0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (2 ) (6 ) 0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 2 6 As discussed in the Risk Management section above, VF has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer term basis, VF believes the year to year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease. Income Taxes As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year. The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VFs income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the more likely than not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses. VF has $174.9 million of deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and $145.6 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. In addition, VF has $6.0 million of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period. 50 VF has not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of the foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions. If VF decided to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, the provision for income taxes could increase in that period. Non GAAP Financial Information Operating Income and Earnings per Share are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K both on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis which excludes the impact of transaction and restructuring expenses related to the Timberland acquisition in 2011 and impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in 2010. These measures are non GAAP measures. Management believes these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding VFs underlying business trends and performance of VFs ongoing operations and are useful for period over period comparisons of such operations. Management uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting and review process and, in some cases, as a factor in determining compensation. While management believes that these non GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, VFs operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to VFs operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto. Forward looking statements are made based on VFs expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. VF cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements are summarized in Item 1A. of this Annual Report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. A discussion of VFs market risks is incorporated by reference to Risk Management in Item 7.
