Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Most of Valeros refineries and supply and distribution networks are strategically located in the markets Valero serves. For example, in Quebec, Canada and in the adjacent Atlantic provinces, Valero is the largest independent retailer of gasoline. The industry tends to be seasonal with increased demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and, in the northeast regions, increased demand for home heating oil during the winter months. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The principal environmental risks associated with Valeros operations are emissions into the air and releases into soil or groundwater. Valeros operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and compositions of gasoline and diesel fuels. Valeros operations are subject to environmental regulation by several federal, state and local authorities. The significant federal laws applicable to Valeros operations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In February 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its "Tier II" gasoline standard pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The standard requires the sulfur content in gasoline to be reduced from approximately 300 parts per million to 30 parts per million; the regulation will be phased in between 2004 and 2006. In addition, the EPAs Tier II distillate standard requires the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold to highway consumers to be reduced from 500 parts per million to 15 parts per million, beginning in 2006. (The American Petroleum Institute is challenging the EPAs distillate standard in federal court.) Modifications will be required at each of Valeros refineries as a result of the Tier II standards. Valero believes that capital expenditures, not including costs for hydrogen facilities, of approximately $550 million will be required for its refineries to meet the Tier II standards. (Valero expects to refine this estimate throughout the phase in of the Tier II standards.) Valero began implementing the modifications in 2002 and expects modifications to be complete in time for compliance with the effective dates of the gasoline and distillate standards. In 2000, the EPA issued to a majority of refiners operating in the United States a series of information requests pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act as part of an enforcement initiative. Valero received a Section 114 information request pertaining to all of its refineries owned at that time. Valero completed its response to the request and has provided additional clarification requested by the EPA. After Valero received its Section 114 information request, 16 Valero acquired the Benicia Refinery and the Golden Eagle Refinery, which were subject to Section 114 information requests received by the prior owners of these refineries. Valero has not been named in any proceeding. However, based in part upon announced settlements and evaluation of its relative position, Valero expects to incur penalties and related expenses in connection with its potential settlement of this enforcement initiative. Valero believes that any potential settlement penalties and expenses will be immaterial to its financial position. Valero believes that any potential settlement with the EPA in this matter will require various capital improvements, which could be material in the aggregate, or changes in operating parameters or both at some or all of its refineries. The presence of MTBE in some water supplies in California and other states, resulting from gasoline leaks primarily from underground and aboveground storage tanks, has led to public concern that MTBE has contaminated drinking water supplies and thus poses a possible health risk. As a result of heightened public concern, California passed initiatives to ban the use of MTBE as a gasoline component in California by the end of 2002. The California Air Resources Boards specifications for CARB Phase III gasoline are expected to become effective at the end of 2002. Valero estimates that the cost for permitting and modification of its California refineries to comply with CARB Phase III specifications and eliminate MTBE as a gasoline component is approximately $50 million. Valero, like other producers of MTBE, is subject to litigation or proceedings involving the manufacture or use of MTBE. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings Environmental Proceedings" below. In addition, other states and the EPA have either passed or proposed or are considering proposals to restrict or ban the use of MTBE. If MTBE were to be restricted or banned throughout the United States, Valero believes that its major non California MTBE producing facilities could be modified to produce iso octane for a capital investment of approximately $35 million. The Houston/Galveston State Implementation Plan (SIP) was approved by the EPA in October 2001. The SIP requires the Houston/Galveston area to reduce NOx emissions by 75 percent from both stationary and mobile sources. The SIP will require the area to demonstrate compliance with the Clean Air Acts ozone standard by 2007. Valeros Texas City and Houston refineries are included within the region affected by the SIP. To achieve compliance, Valero is required to install advanced emission control technology at its Texas City and Houston refineries by 2007, at a cost estimated by Valero to be approximately $50 million. In 2001, Valeros capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were approximately $34 million, and are currently estimated to be $165 million for 2002 and $450 million for 2003. These estimates for 2002 and 2003 do not include expenditures for the installation of a flue gas scrubber at the Texas City Refinery (funded through a structured lease arrangement), or any amounts related to constructed facilities for which the portion of expenditures relating to compliance with environmental regulations is not determinable. Governmental regulations are complex, are subject to different interpretations and are becoming increasingly more stringent. Therefore, future action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to expected operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition, because certain air emissions at Valeros refineries have been grandfathered under particular environmental laws, any major upgrades at any of its refineries could require potentially material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. 17 EMPLOYEES As of January 31, 2002, Valero had 22,452 employees, including salaried and hourly employees, of which 19,012 were employed in the United States and 3,440 were employed in Canada. PROPERTIES Valeros principal properties are described above under the caption "Valeros Operations." In addition, Valero owns feedstock and refined product storage facilities in various locations. Valero believes that its properties and facilities are generally adequate for its operations and that its facilities are maintained in a good state of repair. Valero is the lessee under a number of cancelable and non cancelable leases for certain properties, including the Corpus Christi Refinery East Plant and related product logistics business which were acquired under capital lease agreements, the Benicia Refinery dock facility, office facilities, retail facilities, transportation equipment and various assets used to store, transport and produce refinery feedstocks and or refined products. See Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valeros patents relating to its refining operations are not material to Valero as a whole. The trademarks and tradenames under which Valero conducts its retail and branded wholesale business specifically Diamond Shamrock(R), Ultramar(R), Valero(R), Beacon(R), Total(R), Exxon(R), Corner Store(R), Ultramart(R), Stop N Go(R) and ValPar(TM) and other trademarks employed in the marketing of petroleum products are important to Valeros operations. Valero currently has about 220 company operated convenience stores and supplies about 600 distributor owned sites under a brand license agreement with TotalFinaElf for use of the Total(R) brand name. The Total branded sites are located in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. Per the license agreement with TotalFinaElf, Valeros rights to use the Total(R) brand will expire in Colorado in 2002, and in other states in subsequent years through 2007. Valero believes that it can successfully convert, when necessary, from the Total(R) brand to another of Valeros proprietary brands without adversely impacting Valeros operations. 18 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT NAME AGE POSITIONS HELD WITH VALERO OFFICER SINCE WILLIAM E.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Environmental Proceedings EPA Region VI v. Diamond Shamrock Refining Company, L.P. (McKee Refinery and Three Rivers Refinery). On September 15, 1998, UDS was notified by the Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the EPA, of alleged violations at the McKee Refinery and Three Rivers Refinery of various record keeping and reporting requirements and certain other alleged operating and permitting violations of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and RCRA. A Consent Decree was entered by the federal district court on September 20, 2001 to settle this matter. Pursuant to the settlement, in November 2001, Diamond Shamrock Refining Company, L.P. paid a penalty of $1.2 million and funded a supplemental environmental project in the amount of $625,000. EPA Region V v. Total Petroleum, Inc. (Alma Refinery). This enforcement action began in September 1997. The allegations pertain to a refinery at Alma, Michigan, owned by Total Petroleum, Inc. (TPI) and include alleged Clean Air Act violations relating to emissions monitoring, reporting and inspection. Other allegations included alleged RCRA violations relating to maintenance of wastewater ponds, storage of hazardous waste, and disposal of wastes. UDS acquired TPI in 1997, and in December 1999, UDS closed the Alma Refinery. In April 2000, TPI settled the EPA enforcement action, which required the funding of $9.9 million of specific environmental and economic development projects and the payment of $4.0 million in penalties. A Consent Decree reflecting the settlement was entered by the district court on March 27, 2001. These settlement amounts were fully accrued as of March 31, 2001. Valero is still negotiating the terms of a corrective action agreement with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as required by the Consent Decree. EPA Region VI v. Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Company (Albuquerque products terminal). On December 30, 1998, the EPA issued a notice of violation alleging noncompliance with certain Clean Air Act fuel loading procedures, inspection and leak detection requirements, record keeping provisions, throughput limitations on certain tanks and VOC emissions limitations. In 2000, the EPA referred the enforcement to DOJ. On March 7, 2001, the DOJ served notice of claims for the alleged air permit violations at the UDS Albuquerque products terminal. Valero is negotiating with the DOJ to resolve this matter. EPA Region VIII vs. Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation (certain underground storage tank systems in Colorado and Wyoming). In 2000, the EPA and state regulators inspected certain retail facilities with underground storage tanks for compliance with federal and state rules and regulations at such facilities. On April 3, 2001, UDS received an administrative complaint from the EPA seeking penalties in connection with alleged violations and non compliance issues arising primarily prior to October 1999. This matter was settled in November 2001 upon payment of $126,764 in penalties. California Environmental Protection Agency Department of Toxic Substances Control. Valero received a Draft Enforcement Order on July 17, 2001 pertaining to its Benicia Refinery. The Order alleged noncompliance with several state and federal waste management requirements. Valero entered into discussions with the agency to resolve the matter, and the agency modified its allegations and reduced the stated penalties to an amount less than $100,000. New Mexico v. General Electric, et al., United States District Court for the District of New Mexico (served January 5, 2000). The South Valley of Albuquerque, New Mexico has been designated as a federal Superfund site under 20 CERCLA. Under various state and federal administrative orders, EPA and the State of New Mexico have been directing the cleanup of certain groundwater contamination plumes that are alleged to impact the groundwater supply of Albuquerque. In 1999, the State of New Mexico sued several companies, including General Electric and UDS, seeking recovery of natural resource damage under CERCLA and certain New Mexico environmental laws. General Electric, the single largest potentially responsible party, filed cross claims against several other parties, including UDS, seeking contribution. Trial is scheduled for the fall of 2002. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) (Corpus Christi West Plant). Valero received notices of enforcement from the TNRCC on May 1, 2001; June 22, 2001; August 30, 2001; and December 7, 2001, for alleged noncompliance with certain TNRCC air upset, air emission and record keeping requirements. Valero has asked the TNRCC to consolidate all pending enforcement actions for this refinery into one enforcement order. The TNRCC has not yet issued an enforcement order related to these notices, and no penalties have been assessed. TNRCC (Houston Refinery). On December 5, 2001, the TNRCC issued a notice of enforcement action for alleged noncompliance with certain TNRCC air upset/maintenance regulations and certain air emission and record keeping requirements. TNRCC seeks penalties in the amount of $276,499, but Valero is negotiating with TNRCC and expects the penalties to be reduced. TNRCC (McKee Refinery). UDS received notices of enforcement from the TNRCC on May 4, 2001 and June 5, 2001, for alleged noncompliance with certain emissions monitoring and record keeping requirements. Valero also received a notice of enforcement dated February 21, 2002 from the TNRCC for alleged noncompliance with certain emissions and property line requirements. The TNRCC is developing an enforcement action for these alleged violations, and no penalties have been assessed to date. Valero is negotiating to resolve these issues. TNRCC (Texas City Refinery). Valero received a notice of enforcement from the TNRCC on July 7, 2001, for alleged noncompliance with certain TNRCC air upset/maintenance regulations. Valero is contesting most of the TNRCCs allegations in this notice. The TNRCC has not yet issued an enforcement order related to this notice, and no penalties have been assessed. Valero also received a notice of violation on January 2, 2002 regarding a sulfur recovery unit upset that occurred on November 7, 2001. No penalties have been assessed. Valero is contesting this notice. TNRCC (Three Rivers Refinery). A notice of enforcement from the TNRCC was issued on August 31, 2001 for alleged noncompliance with certain air upset/maintenance regulations and record keeping requirements. The TNRCC has not issued an enforcement order related to this notice, and no penalties have been assessed. Valero also received a notice of violation on February 11, 2002 for alleged noncompliance with air upset/maintenance regulations, record keeping requirements and flaring regulations. The TNRCC has not issued an enforcement order related to this notice, and no penalties have been assessed. MTBE Litigation. Valero has been named as defendant in several cases alleging MTBE contamination in groundwater in New York, Texas and California. Complaints in the three New York cases including those in Berisha and OBrien v. Amerada Hess Corporation, et al., Case No. MDL 1358, Master File C.A. No. 1:00 1898 [SAS], United States District Court for the Southern District of New York allege that the gasoline suppliers produced and or distributed gasoline that is alleged to be defective because it contained MTBE. The four Texas cases are based on the alleged discharge of gasoline into East Caddo Creek in Hunt County, Texas on March 9, 2000 when a pipeline belonging to Explorer Pipeline Company ruptured. Valero was named in City of Dallas v. Explorer Pipeline Company, Inc., Valero 21 Energy Corporation, et al., 160th State District Court, Dallas County, Texas (filed May 14, 2001) and related private landowner cases. The three California cases are primarily based on a product liability/product defect theory. In the New York, Texas and California cases, the plaintiffs generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any one of these claims or proceedings would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position, but that an adverse result in a majority of these cases could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position. Other Litigation Union Oil Company of California v. Valero Energy Corporation, United States District Court, Central District of California (filed January 22, 2002). On January 22, 2002, Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Valero in California federal court. The complaint seeks a 5.75 cent per gallon royalty on all reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocals 393 and 126 patents. These patents cover certain compositions of cleaner burning gasoline. The complaint seeks treble damages for Valeros alleged willful infringement of Unocals patents. In a previous lawsuit, Unocal prevailed against five other major refiners involving its 393 patent. In August 2001, the FTC announced that it would begin an antitrust investigation concerning Unocals conduct with a joint industry research group during the time that Unocal was prosecuting its patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The FTC could potentially issue an injunction against Unocals enforcement of its patents as a result of the FTC investigation. In 2001, the PTO began a reexamination of Unocals 393 patent, and in January 2002, the PTO issued a notice of rejection of all claims of the 393 patent. Unocal has the opportunity to respond to the PTOs action. In January 2002, the PTO reversed an earlier denial and began a reexamination of Unocals 126 patent. Both reexaminations could affect the scope and validity of the patents. Notwithstanding the judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation, Valero believes that it has several strong defenses to Unocals lawsuit, including those arising from Unocals misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that Valero will prevail, and an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on Valeros results of operations and financial position. Teco Pipeline Company v. Valero Energy Corporation, et al., 215th State District Court, Harris County, Texas (filed April 24, 1996). Valero, together with Old Valero and certain of its natural gas related subsidiaries, were sued by Teco Pipeline Company regarding the operation of a 340 mile pipeline in West Texas in which a subsidiary of Old Valero owned a 50% undivided interest and Teco owned a 50% undivided interest. A subsidiary of Old Valero was the operator of the pipeline. The plaintiff asserted that the defendants acted in bad faith and negatively affected the economics of the pipeline in order to provide financial advantages to facilities or entities owned by the defendants. Arbitration of the matter began in February 2001 and concluded in the fourth quarter of 2001. In December 2001, the arbitration panel ruled against the plaintiff, and this matter was closed. Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the range of any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and Valero cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 22 ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2001. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Common Stock. Valeros common stock has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since August 1, 1997 (the business day immediately following the Restructuring) under the symbol "VLO." In connection with the UDS Acquisition on December 31, 2001, approximately 45.9 million shares of Valero common stock were issued to UDS shareholders in exchange for shares of UDS common stock under the terms of the merger agreement (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As of February 28, 2002, there were 7,265 holders of record and an estimated 50,500 additional beneficial owners of Valeros common stock. The following table sets forth for each quarter in the preceding two years the range of the high and low sales prices of Valeros common stock as reported by the NYSE and the amount of per share dividends.
