ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of the results of operations and financial condition of Valero should be read in conjunction with Items 1 2, Business Properties and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per share amounts assume dilution. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K, including without limitation the discussion below under the heading Results of Operations Outlook, contains certain estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions and other forward looking statements (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties. While these forward looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect Valeros current judgment regarding the direction of its business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. These forward looking statements can generally be identified by the words anticipate, believe, expect, plan, intend, estimate, project, budget, forecast, will, could, should, may and similar expressions. These forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: future refining margins, including gasoline and heating oil margins; future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and convenience store merchandise margins; expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil discounts, and operating expenses; anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; Valeros anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on Valeros results of operations; anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada and elsewhere; expectations regarding environmental and other regulatory initiatives; and the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. Valeros forward looking statements are based on its beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time the statements are made. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: acts of terrorism aimed at either Valeros facilities or other facilities that could impair Valeros ability to produce and or transport refined products or receive foreign feedstocks; political conditions in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil and petrochemicals; the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; environmental and other regulations at both the state and federal levels and in foreign countries; 25 Table of Contents the level of foreign imports of refined products; accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting Valeros refineries, machinery, pipelines or equipment, or those of Valeros suppliers or customers; changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles; cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products; rulings, judgments or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; the introduction or enactment of federal or state legislation which may adversely affect Valeros business or operations; changes in the credit ratings assigned to Valeros debt securities and trade credit; changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect Valeros future results of operations and whether any forward looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Valeros forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward looking statements. Valero does not intend to update these statements unless it is required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to Valero or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 26 Table of Contents Overview As of December 31, 2003, Valero owned and operated 14 refineries in the United States and Canada with a combined throughput capacity, including crude oil and other feedstocks, of approximately 2.1 million barrels per day. Valero markets refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a network of more than 4,500 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States and eastern Canada. Valeros operations are affected by: company specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds, seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products, and industry factors, such as movements in and the absolute price of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. Valeros profitability is determined in large part by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, or the refined product margin. Additionally, since almost 50% of Valeros throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks, Valeros profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil discount. During 2003, both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts improved significantly from 2002 levels. Due to various factors, including strong refined product demand in both domestic and foreign markets and an anticipated reduction in supply attributable to various factors, including the ban on MTBE in certain areas of the United States and implementation of the new clean fuel Tier II regulations, Valero believes that the outlook for both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts is favorable. The positive 2003 results from Valeros operations, as well as certain investing and financing activities during 2003, are expected to favorably position Valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return, continued growth and improved earnings stability. During 2003, Valero reduced its debt by approximately $726 million, resulting in a decrease in its debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) from approximately 50% at December 31, 2002 to approximately 40% at the end of 2003. During 2003, Valeros debt and debt to capitalization ratio were positively impacted by the following: the generation of $1.8 billion of cash from operating activities; the ceasing of consolidation of Valero L.P., which removed Valero L.P.s debt from Valeros consolidated balance sheet, and the receipt of $380 million of proceeds resulting from the subsequent contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P.; the issuance of 6.3 million shares of Valero common stock, the proceeds of which were used for repayments of borrowings under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities; and the issuance of 4.9 million shares of Valero common stock resulting from the settlement of purchase contracts associated with the $172.5 million of Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units). In addition during 2003, Valero continued its strategic growth through the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the start up of a 45,000 barrel per day coker unit at the Texas City Refinery. The St. Charles Refinery operated at 95% of capacity, averaging almost 200,000 barrels per day of throughput, since Valero acquired it on July 1, 2003. The St. Charles Refinery contributed approximately $39 million to Valeros operating income for the last six months of 2003. The 45,000 barrel per day coker unit at the Texas City Refinery began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will enable the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil. The ability to process the lower cost crude oil is expected to significantly lower the refinerys average feedstock costs. Going forward, the St. Charles Acquisition and the start up of the coker unit at the Texas City Refinery are expected to further enable Valero to benefit from wider sour crude oil discounts that Valero believes will occur. Valero believes that it has significantly improved its feedstock flexibility and leverage to benefit from an expected continuation of good refining industry fundamentals. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2003 Compared to 2002 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2003 (a) 2002 Change Operating revenues $ 37,968.6 $ 29,047.9 $ 8,920.7 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 33,587.1 25,863.2 7,723.9 Refining operating expenses 1,656.0 1,331.6 324.4 Retail selling expenses 693.6 674.5 19.1 Administrative expenses 299.4 258.4 41.0 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 417.1 388.3 28.8 Retail 39.6 43.1 (3.5 ) Administrative 53.8 17.9 35.9 Total costs and expenses 36,746.6 28,577.0 8,169.6 Operating income 1,222.0 470.9 751.1 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

General Valeros net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $621.5 million, or $5.09 per share, compared to $91.5 million, or $0.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the fourth quarter of 2003, Valeros net income was $131.6 million, or $1.01 per share, compared to $89.0 million, or $0.81 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2002. 31 Table of Contents Operating revenues increased 31% from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. The increase in operating income from $470.9 million for 2002 to $1.2 billion for 2003 was attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valeros refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for Valeros refining segment was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $744.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a 15% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors: Gasoline and distillate margins improved significantly during 2003 compared to 2002 due to strong demand and lower inventory levels. Demand for distillates improved significantly in 2003 due to colder winter weather in the Northeast and fuel switching demand in early 2003 caused by high natural gas prices. Refined product inventories were lower than the inventory levels that existed during most of 2002 due to the stronger demand combined with lower refinery production rates resulting from a large number of maintenance turnarounds in the refining industry in the first quarter of 2003 and the continuing impact of the oil workers strike in Venezuela in early 2003, which also reduced production rates. The high inventory levels in 2002 were caused by weaker economic conditions, an unusually warm winter in the northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet fuel demand. Discounts on Valeros sour crude oil feedstocks increased for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due mainly to the resumption of higher crude oil production rates by OPEC. Valeros throughput volumes for 2003 increased from 2002 due to incremental volumes from the St. Charles Refinery commencing in July 2003 and increased refinery utilization rates during 2003, as eight of Valeros refineries were affected by turnaround activities during 2002. Also during 2002, production at several refineries was reduced at various times during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions. The above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of: a net benefit of approximately $76 million in 2002 resulting from the settlement of petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges, a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of Valeros LIFO inventories in 2002, approximately $62 million resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, and an increase in unplanned downtime during 2003 at certain of Valeros refineries. Refining operating expenses were 24% higher for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003, higher energy costs (primarily related to natural gas), an increase in employee compensation expense including increased variable compensation, and increased maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime. However, the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was only 8% from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. 32 Table of Contents Retail Retail operating income was $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $83.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in both the U.S. and Northeast retail systems and operational improvements. During 2003, Valero continued to implement its U.S. retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or non strategic stores. During 2003, Valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores. These changes contributed to improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003. Corporate Expenses and Other Administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable compensation expense of approximately $21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002. Also, in December 2003, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized and reflected in administrative depreciation and amortization expense to write down the carrying value of Valeros current headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs, as described further in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses, ad valorem taxes and litigation costs. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valeros equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Valeros ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. Valeros ownership interest in Valero L.P. has been further reduced to 45.7% as of December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of the issuance of additional common units by Valero L.P. in April and August 2003. Prior to March 18, 2003, Valero consolidated the operations of Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations. The increase in other income, net from 2002 to 2003 is due mainly to a gain of $17.0 million related to the sale of notes receivable from Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro) in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Refinery and related assets in 2002. This gain was offset by a $7.1 million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation of $4.2 million. Net interest expense decreased $24.4 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in debt levels from $5 billion as of December 31, 2002 to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the PEPS Units in August 2003. Income tax expense increased from $58.2 million in 2002 to $365.1 million in 2003 due to the significant increase in pre tax income. 33 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Net income $ 621.5 $ 91.5 Income tax expense 365.1 58.2 Depreciation and amortization expense 510.5 449.3 Interest and debt expense, net 261.3 285.7 Other amortizations (3.8 ) (5.9 ) EBITDA $ 1,754.6 $ 878.8 Valero utilizes the financial measure of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which is not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles. Management presents EBITDA in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its press releases. Management uses this financial measure because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA is used in the computation of certain debt covenant ratios included in Valeros various debt agreements. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor is it presented as an alternative to operating income or income before income taxes. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Valeros method of computation of EBITDA may or may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The following is the computation of the ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 EBITDA $ 1,754.6 $ 878.8 Divided by interest incurred 287.6 301.9 Ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred 6.1 x 2.9 x Valero utilizes the ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred, which is not defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles.

General Valeros net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $91.5 million, or $0.83 per share, compared to net income of $563.6 million, or $8.83 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. 38 Table of Contents Operating revenues increased 94% for 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of the additional throughput volumes from the refinery operations acquired in the UDS, El Paso and Huntway Acquisitions and the additional revenues generated from the retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition, partially offset by a decline in refined product prices. However, operating income for 2002 declined $530.5 million, or 53%, from the $1.0 billion reported in 2001 due mainly to a $542.1 million decrease in operating income from the refining segment and a $115.0 million increase in administrative expenses (including related depreciation and amortization expense), partially offset by an increase of $126.6 million in operating income from the retail segment attributable to the retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition. Operating income for 2002 benefited from synergies that were created as a result of the merger between Valero and UDS. Synergies of the combined company resulted in both gross margin improvements and reductions in operating and administrative expenses. The gross margin synergies related primarily to a reduction in inventory levels, yield optimization and operational initiatives. Operating and administrative expense synergies were achieved mainly from incorporating best practices between the two companies procurement and energy contract initiatives and eliminating salaries and benefits associated with former UDS executives and other employees. Refining Operating income for Valeros refining segment declined from $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $618.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in refining segment operating income was due principally to a 34% decline in the throughput margin per barrel attributable to depressed sour crude oil discounts and lower refined product margins in all of Valeros markets. During 2002, refining total throughput margin was negatively impacted by the following factors: discounts on Valeros sour crude oil feedstocks during 2002 declined approximately 50% from 2001 levels primarily due to OPECs crude oil production cuts in 2002, which limited the availability of sour crude oil on the world market, whereas 2001 benefited from increased supplies of sour crude oil while demand for sweeter crude oil increased to meet lower sulfur requirements for certain refined products; gasoline and distillate margins declined significantly from 2001 to 2002 due to high inventory levels for these products as a result of an increase in gasoline imports, increased gasoline production (particularly in California), an unusually warm winter in the northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet fuel demand. Although gasoline demand increased during the year, high imports of gasoline kept inventories at above normal levels; and Valeros refinery utilization rates were significantly below its normal operating rates during 2002 as eight of Valeros refineries were affected by turnaround activities. In addition to the scheduled downtime, Valero also experienced significant unplanned maintenance at its refineries during 2002, and production at most of its refineries was reduced at various times during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions. The above decreases in refining throughput margin were partially offset by the increased throughput volumes resulting from the UDS, Huntway and El Paso Acquisitions, a net benefit of approximately $76 million resulting from the settlement in June and August 2002 of petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges, and a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of its LIFO inventories. Refining operating expenses and refining depreciation and amortization expense were 57% and 70% higher, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of the additional refinery operations from the UDS, El Paso and Huntway Acquisitions. However, these operating costs on a per barrel basis remained stable from 2001 to 2002 as a result of the additional throughput volumes from these acquisitions. 39 Table of Contents Retail Retail operating income was $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 retail operating income includes both the U.S. and Northeast retail operations acquired in the UDS Acquisition. The 2001 retail operations included only 11 northern California retail stores operated by Valero at that time. During 2002, pursuant to a plan adopted in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, Valero implemented various changes in its retail operations that benefited results in 2002 and are expected to continue to benefit future results for the retail segment. As part of these changes, 76 stores were reimaged and upgraded in 2002. These changes also included the closure or divestiture of approximately 160 stores and the identification of an additional 150 stores for closure or divestiture. Gains or losses on divested stores are recognized to the extent of the difference between any net proceeds received on disposition and the net book value of each store. Retail selling expenses and retail depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 were significantly higher than 2001 due to the additional retail stores acquired in the UDS Acquisition. Corporate Expenses and Other Administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased $115.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was due primarily to additional administrative expenses resulting from the UDS Acquisition and increases in employee salaries and benefits and professional services, partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of the lower level of operating income recognized during 2002 and the nonrecurrence in 2002 of integration and early retirement costs incurred in 2001 in connection with the UDS Acquisition. Other income (expense), net increased $13.2 million from expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to income of $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to a $7.0 million increase in equity income from Valeros investments in joint ventures and $5.9 million of interest income related to the amortization of the discount on the notes receivable from Tesoro in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business. Net interest and debt expense increased $197.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was due primarily to interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance the UDS Acquisition coupled with interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the UDS Acquisition, as well as the full year effect of interest expense on the capital lease obligations associated with the June 1, 2001 El Paso Acquisition. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represents the minority unitholders share of the net income of Valero L.P. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts increased to $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 due to the distributions incurred on the $200 million TOPrS assumed in the UDS Acquisition. Income tax expense decreased $273.1 million from 2001 to 2002 mainly as a result of lower operating income and higher interest expense. 40 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Net income $ 91.5 $ 563.6 Income tax expense 58.2 331.3 Depreciation and amortization expense 449.3 237.7 Interest and debt expense, net 285.7 88.5 Other amortizations (5.9 ) EBITDA $ 878.8 $ 1,221.1 The following is the computation of the ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 EBITDA $ 878.8 $ 1,221.1 Divided by interest incurred 301.9 99.1 Ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred 2.9 x 12.3 x OUTLOOK During January and February 2004, refining industry fundamentals continued to improve, resulting in both higher refined product margins and wider sour crude oil discounts than those realized in the fourth quarter of 2003. In regard to refined products, distillate demand has been strong primarily due to the cold weather in the Northeast, which has helped support heating oil margins at attractive levels. Gasoline margins have also increased since the end of 2003 as a result of strong demand resulting from improved economies in both the United States and Asia. In addition, gasoline margins have benefited from reduced imports attributable in part to the impact of the new lower sulfur specifications for gasoline that became effective January 1, 2004 and the effect of the removal of MTBE from gasoline in several states. Refined product supplies are expected to be further impacted in the short term as a high level of industry wide turnaround activity is anticipated during the first quarter of 2004. Valero expects these factors to continue to support strong gasoline margins as summer approaches. In addition to the favorable outlook for refined product margins, sour crude oil discounts have widened significantly from the fourth quarter of 2003 and are expected to continue to benefit from various factors. These factors include an expected increase in sour crude oil supplies on world markets, partly due to certain refiners processing more sweet crude oil and less sour crude oil as a result of the new lower sulfur specifications. Also, the favorable economic environment anticipated for 2004 should result in the production of more sour crude oil to satisfy expected higher refined product demand, which should also contribute to wide sour crude oil discounts. The significant turnaround activity is also projected to positively impact sour crude oil discounts since a significant amount of the reduced capacity resulting from these turnarounds is sour crude oil processing capacity. Operationally, Valero expects to benefit during 2004 from the full year effect of the St. Charles Refinery that was acquired in July 2003 and from an expansion of that facilitys crude and coker units in March 2004. Valero also expects to benefit throughout 2004 from a new 45,000 barrel per day coker unit at the Texas City Refinery that began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, Valeros acquisition of the Aruba Refinery in March 2004 is expected to be accretive to Valeros earnings for 2004 and beyond. The Aruba Refinery processes heavy, sour crude oil, primarily Mayan crude oil, and therefore complements Valeros strategy of processing heavy, sour crude oil that generally sells at a discount to sweet crude oil. 41 Table of Contents As a result of these factors, Valero believes it is well positioned to capitalize during 2004 on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.8 billion compared to $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under Results of Operations and changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under Valeros accounts receivable sales programs. During 2003, the amount of receivables sold under the program increased by $350 million, while during 2002, working capital was unfavorably impacted by a $123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold. For the year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to the $350.0 million increase in the amount of receivables sold, changes in working capital included a $415.8 million increase in accounts payable, which more than offset a $270.0 million increase in inventories. Inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at December 31, 2003 attributable primarily to (i) lower than normal feedstock levels at December 31, 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers strike in Venezuela and (ii) increased refinery utilization rates during 2003. In addition to the $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003, including proceeds of approximately $300 million from the issuance of senior notes in June, $250.3 million from the issuance of common stock in March, $379.9 million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P., $89.6 million from the sale of Tesoro notes held by Valero, and $94.2 million from the disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other property, plant and equipment. Valero used these proceeds to: fund $1.1 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; exercise options under certain structured lease arrangements to purchase $275.0 million of property and exercise an option under certain capital leases to purchase for $289.3 million the Corpus Christi East Refinery and related refined product logistics assets; fund part of the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery for $309.0 million; redeem the $200 million of TOPrS and $100 million of 8% debentures; fund a $106.1 million investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $50.6 million of earn out payments and approximately $35.0 million of other acquisitions; and pay common and preferred stock dividends of $50.6 million. The remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under Valeros committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $272.3 million compared to $905.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $633.2 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was due primarily to the unfavorable change in income as described above under Results of Operations and an $80.1 million increase in the amount of cash used to fund working capital and deferred charges and credits. Changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2002 included: 42 Table of Contents a significant increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable resulting from increased commodity prices from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002; an increase in receivables of approximately $123 million due to a reduction in the amount of receivables sold under Valeros accounts receivable sales facility; the receipt of approximately $141 million of income tax refunds, net of payments; and a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of payments for change in control benefits to former UDS employees and a decrease in employee bonuses. Valeros investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 provided net cash of $248.6 million. Valeros investing activities included the receipt of $300.9 million from the liquidation of its investment in the Diamond Koch joint venture and $925.0 million from the sale of the Golden Eagle Business, partially offset by payments of $803.4 million for capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs and earn out payments and net cash requirements related to the Golden Eagle Business of $183.5 million. During 2002, operating and investing activities provided $520.9 million of cash, which was used primarily to reduce Valeros debt by $412.9 million with a resulting increase of $109.5 million in Valeros cash balance. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2003, Valero expended $1.1 billion for capital investments of which $975.8 million related to capital expenditures (including approximately $540 million for environmental projects) and $136.4 million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003 included $438 million to fund construction of gasoline desulfurization units at the Texas City, Paulsboro, Quebec and Corpus Christi West Refineries in response to Tier II sulfur regulations. The capital expenditure amount above excludes $134 million and $55 million, respectively, related to a coker facility at the Texas City Refinery and the expansion of the former UDS headquarters facility, which will be Valeros new corporate headquarters, both of which were being funded through structured lease arrangements 43 Table of Contents through December 31, 2003 (see the discussion below in Structured Lease Arrangements under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition to the $1.1 billion of capital investments discussed above, $275.0 million was expended for the purchase of certain convenience stores and Valeros current headquarters buildings, which were previously subject to structured lease arrangements (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $106.1 million was invested in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $50.6 million of payments were made related to the earn out contingency agreements discussed below and $344 million of cash was expended for strategic acquisitions. In connection with Valeros acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997, the Paulsboro Refinery in 1998, and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years, five years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Any payments due under these earn out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2003, Valero made earn out contingency payments of $35.0 million related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc. and $15.6 million related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery. No future earn out payments related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery will be due as the term of that earn out arrangement expired in September 2003. Based on estimated margin levels for 2004, earn out payments related to the Basis Petroleum and St. Charles Acquisitions of approximately $35 million and $50 million, respectively, would be due in May 2004 and January 2005. For 2004, excluding the Aruba Refinery, Valero expects to incur approximately $1.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.3 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $625 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $215 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for 2004 for the Aruba Refinery are estimated to be approximately $100 million. The capital expenditure estimate excludes the purchase of properties previously leased under four structured lease arrangements, as further discussed in Structured Lease Arrangements under Off Balance Sheet Arrangements below. The capital expenditure estimate also excludes anticipated expenditures related to the earn out contingency agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. Valero continuously evaluates its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant. Contractual Obligations Valeros contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ $ 409.6 $ 560.0 $ 356.9 $ 6.5 $ 2,972.0 $ 4,305.0 Capital lease obligations 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.6 3.4 6.0 Operating lease obligations 172.8 152.1 136.9 116.5 88.1 197.3 863.7 Structured lease arrangements 15.3 23.4 21.9 1.1 61.7 Purchase obligations 2,009.6 1,161.0 789.9 775.6 578.8 841.5 6,156.4 Total $ 2,198.2 $ 1,746.6 $ 1,509.2 $ 1,250.6 $ 674.0 $ 4,014.2 $ 11,392.8 Long Term Debt Payments for long term debt are at stated values and include payments for debt related to bank facilities as described below under the caption Other Commercial Commitments. None of Valeros agreements have rating agency triggers that would automatically require Valero to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of Valeros senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, borrowings 44 Table of Contents under some of Valeros bank credit facilities, structured leases and other arrangements would become more expensive. Operating Lease Obligations Valeros operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by Valero under subleases. Operating lease obligations exclude long term operating lease commitments that have been funded through structured lease arrangements with non consolidated third party entities as discussed below under the caption Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are reflected separately in the table above. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. Valero has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries. Many of Valeros purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on Valeros usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on minimum quantities to be purchased and or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. Future payments related to benefit plans are not included in the table above due to the difficulty in estimating such payments that results from the many variables affecting the calculation. Valero has not made in the past, nor does it expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that it has not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2003, Valeros committed lines of credit included (in millions): Borrowing Capacity Expiration 3 year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 5 year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn $ 115.0 July 2005 In November 2003, Valero replaced its previous $750 million 364 day revolving bank credit facility with a new $750 million three year revolving credit facility with terms and conditions similar to the 364 day facility. 45 Table of Contents Valeros other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 were as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Total Amounts 2004 2005 2006 Committed Borrowings under lines of credit: 3 year revolving credit facility $ $ $ 130.0 $ 130.0 5 year revolving credit facility 130.0 130.0 Letters of credit 256.1 6.0 245.0 507.1 Total commercial commitments $ 256.1 $ 6.0 $ 505.0 $ 767.1 As of December 31, 2003, Valero had $256.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under its uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $7.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under its Canadian committed facility and $245.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under its committed facilities. Under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities, Valeros debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 40.3% as of December 31, 2003 as compared to 50.4% as of December 31, 2002. For purposes of the computation as of December 31, 2002, 50% of the $200 million of TOPrS and 20% of the $172.5 million of trust preferred securities issued as part of the PEPS Units were included as debt. Valeros refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact Valeros overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, Valero believes that its portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, Valero has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts receivable. Valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund its ongoing operating requirements. Valero expects that, to the extent necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to Valero. PEPS Units As of December 31, 2002, the company obligated preferred securities of subsidiary trusts in Valeros consolidated balance sheet included $172.5 million of 7.75% PEPS Units (6.9 million units at $25.00 per unit). The PEPS Units were issued in 2000 by Valero under a shelf registration statement. Upon issuance, each PEPS Unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by VEC Trust I and an associated purchase contract obligating the holder of the PEPS Unit to purchase on August 18, 2003 a number of shares of common stock from Valero for $25 per purchase contract. The number of shares of common stock issuable for each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on the average price of Valero common stock for the relevant 20 day trading period. Under the original agreement, holders of PEPS Units could settle their purchase contracts by paying cash to Valero or by remarketing their pledged trust preferred securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to settle the purchase contracts. In accordance with the original agreement, the distribution rate on the trust preferred securities was to be reset on August 18, 2003 based on the price for which the trust preferred securities were remarketed. In accordance with the terms of the trust, on August 12, 2003, Valero dissolved VEC Trust I and substituted its senior deferrable notes for the trust preferred securities. As a result, Valeros senior deferrable notes were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust preferred 46 Table of Contents securities, with the interest rate on the senior deferrable notes to be reset on August 18, 2003 based upon the price for which the senior deferrable notes were remarketed. The remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for August 13, 2003. The holders of approximately 6.36 million PEPS Units opted to settle their purchase contract obligations by remarketing the senior deferrable notes (totaling $158.9 million), while holders of approximately 0.54 million PEPS Units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and retain their senior deferrable notes (totaling $13.6 million) in lieu of participating in the remarketing. On August 13, Valero received notice from the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing (as defined in the prospectus supplement related to the PEPS Units) of the senior deferrable notes was deemed to have occurred. The $158.9 million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to Valero to satisfy the holders purchase contract obligations were retained by Valero in full satisfaction of the holders obligations under the purchase contracts and were canceled on August 18, 2003. The remaining $13.6 million of senior deferrable notes mature on August 18, 2005 and bear an interest rate of 6.797%. Valero, in turn, issued 4.9 million shares of its common stock at a price of $34.95 per share in settlement of the 6.9 million purchase contracts. Equity On March 28, 2003, Valero sold in a public offering 6.3 million shares of its common stock at a price of $40.25 per share and received net proceeds of $250.3 million. These shares were issued under Valeros shelf registration statement, with the proceeds used to repay borrowings under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities. In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, Valero issued 10 million shares of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock. Valero pays annual dividends of $0.50 for each share of convertible preferred stock when and if declared by its board of directors. Dividends are paid quarterly, provided that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a particular calendar quarter if Valero does not declare a dividend on its common stock during that calendar quarter. Under common stock repurchase programs approved by Valeros Board of Directors, Valero repurchases shares of its common stock from time to time for use in connection with its employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes. During 2003, Valero repurchased shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of $73.2 million. Through February 2004, Valero has not had any significant additional common share repurchases under these programs. On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 7.8 million shares of its common stock, which included 1.0 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter, at a price of $53.25 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriters discount and commissions, of $406.0 million. These shares were issued under Valeros shelf registration statement to partially fund the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related operations. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2003, Valero contributed approximately $121 million to its qualified pension plans. Based on a 6.25% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of the assets in Valeros qualified plans were equal to approximately 68% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2003. However, the qualified plans were more than 90% funded based on their current liability, which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Environmental Matters Valero is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters will increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of Valeros refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding 47 Table of Contents Valeros environmental matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental regulations, see Environmental Matters in Items 1 2, Business Properties. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2002, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with a third party financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to $250 million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October 2005. In June 2003, Valero amended its agreement to add two additional financial institutions to the program and to increase the size of its facility by $350 million to $600 million. Under this program, wholly owned subsidiaries of Valero sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third party financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions was $600 million. Structured Lease Arrangements As of December 31, 2003, Valero had various long term operating lease commitments that were funded through structured lease arrangements with a financial institution (the lessor), which are summarized below (in millions): Facility Amount Drawn on Leased Facilities Amount December 31, 2003 Expiration Convenience stores and refining assets $ 100.6 $ 100.6 June 2005 Coker facility 300.0 247.1 August 2006 Refining assets and corporate aircraft 61.4 61.4 September 2006 Corporate headquarters facility 170.0 121.6 February 2007 The lessor constructed or purchased the related assets and then leased them to Valero. The assets held by the lessor were funded through equity contributions of the lessor ranging from 3% to 5% of the fair market value of the asset and borrowings from other financial institutions. Neither Valero, its affiliates nor any related parties held any interest in the lessor. For each lease, Valero had the option to purchase the leased assets at any time during the lease term for a price that approximated fair value. Valero has historically used these structured lease arrangements to provide additional liquidity to fund its ongoing operations. However, the cost of administering such structured lease arrangements has escalated over the years, in large part due to more extensive and increasingly complex accounting rules related to such transactions. Recent accounting pronouncements, including Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which is discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as speeches by representatives of organizations such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FASB, have emphasized the need for and the desirability of more transparency in reported financial information. To achieve that objective, new accounting pronouncements related to structured leases have become more complex and compliance with such pronouncements has become increasingly costly and burdensome. Valero desires to support the accounting professions objectives for enhanced transparency in financial reports and, at the same time, eliminate the ongoing and increasing costs inherent in ensuring that these arrangements continue to qualify for off balance sheet treatment. As a result, in March 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of its four existing structured lease 48 Table of Contents arrangements, and the leased properties were purchased through borrowings under Valeros existing bank credit facilities. Valero anticipates refinancing these amounts through the issuance in the near future of term notes at favorable rates. If the purchase of the leased properties had occurred as of December 31, 2003, Valeros outstanding debt would have increased by $531 million, and Valeros debt to capitalization ratio would have been 43.5%. As indicated above in the discussion of Other Commercial Commitments, Valero believes that it has sufficient funds available from various sources to fund its ongoing operating requirements. As a result, Valero does not believe that the above action will significantly affect its liquidity or its ability to fund its ongoing operations. Guarantees In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business, Valero guaranteed certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2003. This lease expires in 2010. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for Valeros financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to have, a material effect on Valeros consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about Valeros critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes Valeros significant accounting policies. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and produced products are determined under the last in, first out (LIFO) method of inventory pricing. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted average cost method. Valero utilizes the dollar value LIFO method and uses average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its LIFO inventory. Property, Plant and Equipment Valero records depreciation expense on its property, plant and equipment using the composite method of depreciation. Under the composite method of depreciation, the costs of minor property units, net of salvage value, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income. Accounting for property, plant and equipment requires various judgments and estimates, including a determination of remaining useful lives, salvage values and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses. In June 2001, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued an exposure draft of a proposed Statement of Position (SOP) entitled Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment, which addressed accounting for depreciation and replacement of property, plant and equipment. The exposure draft concluded that component accounting for a replacement of property, 49 Table of Contents plant and equipment should occur at the time of replacement. If an entity replaces part of a property, plant and equipment asset that has not previously been accounted for as a component, and the replacement meets the definition of a component, then the entity should capitalize the cost of the replacement, account for it as a separate component, estimate the net book value of the replaced item, and charge the net book value of the replaced item to depreciation expense in the period of replacement. Therefore, a consequence of not previously applying component accounting is that the net book value of the replaced item is charged to depreciation expense in the period of the replacement, with net book value calculated using the expected useful life of the total property, plant and equipment asset to which the component relates. In addition, if the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and component rather than composite accounting is required, significant additional estimates and judgments will be required due to the additional volume of assets to be accounted for individually. The proposed SOP is expected to be considered for approval by the FASB in April 2004. If the proposed SOP is approved, its provisions would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. Impairment of Long Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Long lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the long lived asset, goodwill and other intangible assets. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting Valeros earnings. Refinery Turnaround Costs Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at Valeros refineries, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs. The frequency of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit. As of December 31, 2003, Valero had $192.3 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet. The AICPAs exposure draft of a proposed SOP entitled Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and Equipment, discussed above under Property, Plant and Equipment, also addressed accounting for the costs of planned major maintenance activities. The exposure draft concluded that the total cost of planned major maintenance activities cannot be deferred, but that the individual costs incurred in such planned major maintenance activities should be evaluated to determine if they represent the acquisition of additional components or the replacement of existing components. All other costs incurred in a planned major maintenance activity should be charged to expense as incurred. If the provisions of the exposure draft are enacted and turnaround costs are ultimately expensed as incurred, Valeros reported income would become more volatile. The proposed SOP is expected to be considered for approval by the FASB in April 2004. If 50 Table of Contents the proposed SOP is approved, its provisions would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, Valero must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Valero believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. Valero has recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits carried forward, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on Valeros estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from the estimates or Valero adjusts the estimates in future periods, Valero may need to revise the valuation allowance. The net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2003 were $600.1 million, net of a valuation allowance of $82.6 million. Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. An entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit adjusted risk free rate, and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation. These estimates and assumptions are very subjective. However, Valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effect of Valeros adoption of Statement No. 143. Environmental Liabilities Valeros operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as Valeros own internal environmental policies. Valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental exposures. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible contamination, the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of Valeros liability in proportion to other parties, improvements in cleanup technologies, and the extent to which environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside Valeros control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moodys published Aa corporate bond rate as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan 51 Table of Contents assets is based on a compounded return calculated for Valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, representative of the asset mix in Valeros qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in Valeros consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2004 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Change in benefit obligation: Discount rate $ 35.6 $ 8.5 Compensation rate 13.6 Health care cost trend rate 3.7 Change in expense: Discount rate 5.5 0.6 Expected return on plan assets 1.2 Compensation rate 3.2 Health care cost trend rate 0.5 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and natural gas purchases and refined product sales (cash flow hedges). In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in Valeros hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. Valeros positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valeros stated risk management policy which has been approved by Valeros Board of Directors. 52 Table of Contents The following tables provide information about Valeros derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock or product purchases and refined product sales, economic hedges held to: manage price volatility in refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock, natural gas and refined product purchases, and trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 53 Table of Contents December 31, 2003 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 26,464 $ 31.72 N/A $ 839.4 $ 860.1 $ 20.7 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 2 29.84 N/A Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 36,110 N/A $ 31.59 1,140.7 1,180.5 (39.8 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,020 27.89 30.38 N/A 152.0 152.0 2004 (natural gas) 915 5.66 6.08 N/A 0.4 0.4 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,520 34.01 31.62 N/A (147.3 ) (147.3 ) 2004 (natural gas) 458 6.08 5.61 N/A (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 17,266 32.05 N/A 553.5 567.2 13.7 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 14,600 N/A 33.35 487.0 502.1 (15.1 ) 2004 (natural gas) 540 N/A 5.24 2.8 3.3 (0.5 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 2,658 10.73 10.97 N/A 0.6 0.6 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,428 1.66 2.02 N/A 2.6 2.6 Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 16,604 37.25 N/A 618.5 622.9 4.4 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 19,788 N/A 36.32 718.7 730.1 (11.4 ) Options long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 24,719 9.72 N/A 7.0 12.5 5.5 2004 (natural gas) 913 N/A 5.05 0.5 0.9 0.4 Options short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 34,269 N/A 9.68 (13.7 ) (13.2 ) (0.5 ) Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,330 17.09 18.43 N/A 11.2 11.2 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,675 18.99 17.75 N/A (10.7 ) (10.7 ) Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 22,396 31.21 N/A 699.1 724.2 25.1 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 26.46 N/A 5.3 5.7 0.4 2004 (natural gas) 300 5.08 N/A 1.5 1.7 0.2 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 21,416 N/A 31.79 680.8 703.6 (22.8 ) 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 N/A 31.71 6.3 6.7 (0.4 ) 2004 (natural gas) 300 N/A 5.75 1.7 1.8 (0.1 ) Options long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 12,671 13.62 N/A 3.7 8.0 4.3 Options short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,647 N/A 8.56 (3.0 ) (0.7 ) (2.3 ) 54 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 13,290 $ 31.23 N/A $ 415.0 $ 426.8 $ 11.8 Futures short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 15,070 N/A $ 30.85 464.9 492.3 (27.4 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 26,820 26.45 26.98 N/A 14.4 14.4 Swaps short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 26,520 31.27 30.58 N/A (18.1 ) (18.1 ) Futures long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 16,556 30.22 N/A 500.4 516.6 16.2 Futures short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 13,599 N/A 29.02 394.7 424.9 (30.2 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 4,716 1.19 0.81 N/A (1.8 ) (1.8 ) Swaps short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 21,651 3.00 3.18 N/A 3.8 3.8 Futures long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 20,161 33.31 N/A 671.5 687.8 16.3 Futures short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 20,178 N/A 32.21 649.9 675.8 (25.9 ) Options long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 5,414 3.73 N/A (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Options short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 3,800 N/A 3.50 (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 6,150 8.83 9.63 N/A 4.9 4.9 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 450 2.91 3.03 N/A 0.1 0.1 Swaps short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 10,900 7.21 6.70 N/A (5.6 ) (5.6 ) 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 300 4.03 3.75 N/A (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Futures long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 8,866 30.80 N/A 273.0 286.1 13.1 2003 (natural gas) 950 4.78 N/A 4.5 4.4 (0.1 ) Futures short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 7,524 N/A 29.85 224.6 244.2 (19.6 ) 2003 (natural gas) 250 N/A 4.42 1.1 1.2 (0.1 ) Options long: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 4,332 13.45 N/A (0.4 ) 2.1 2.5 2003 (natural gas) 400 3.00 N/A Options short: 2003 (crude oil and refined products) 2,564 N/A 5.00 (2.7 ) 0.6 (3.3 ) 2003 (natural gas) 250 N/A 4.00 0.1 0.2 (0.1 ) 55 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK Valeros primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its long term debt obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, Valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero assumed certain interest rate swap agreements entered into by UDS in order to manage interest rate exposure on certain fixed rate debt obligations. These agreements, which were all terminated in early 2003, were accounted for as speculative transactions. The following table provides information about Valeros long term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (in millions, except interest rates), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. During May 2002, Valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its Canadian operations that Valero intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of U.S. dollars. The following tables present the notional amounts of these contracts by expected (contractual) maturity dates and the total fair value of the contracts as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions): December 31, 2003 Expected Maturity Dates Fair 2004 2005 2006 2007 Total Value Notional amount $ 7.1 $ 31.7 $ 38.1 $ 94.8 $ 171.7 $ (36.6 ) December 31, 2002 Expected Maturity Dates Fair 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Total Value Notional amount $ 50.9 $ 37.9 $ 31.7 $ 38.1 $ 94.8 $ 253.4 $ 6.1 In February 2004, Valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its Canadian operations. As a result, Valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by Valero of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. As of December 31, 2003, Valero had other commitments to purchase $16.7 million of U.S. dollars and sell $6.7 million of U.S. dollars. Valeros market risk was minimal on these contracts as they matured on or before January 9, 2004. 57 Table of Contents
