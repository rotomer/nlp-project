ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of the results of operations and financial condition of Valero should be read in conjunction with Items 1 2, Business Properties, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per share amounts assume dilution. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10 K, including without limitation the discussion below under the heading Results of Operations Outlook, contains certain estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions and other forward looking statements (as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that involve various risks and uncertainties. While these forward looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect Valeros current judgment regarding the direction of its business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. These forward looking statements can generally be identified by the words anticipate, believe, expect, plan, intend, estimate, project, budget, forecast, will, could, should, may and similar expressions. These forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: future refining margins, including gasoline and heating oil margins; future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil and convenience store merchandise margins; expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil discounts, and operating expenses; anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; Valeros anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on Valeros results of operations; anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada and elsewhere; expectations regarding environmental and other regulatory initiatives; and the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. Valeros forward looking statements are based on its beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time the statements are made. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: acts of terrorism aimed at either Valeros facilities or other facilities that could impair Valeros ability to produce and or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; political conditions in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil and petrochemicals; the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; environmental and other regulations at both the state and federal levels and in foreign countries; 25 Table of Contents the level of foreign imports of refined products; accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting Valeros refineries, machinery, pipelines or equipment, or those of Valeros suppliers or customers; changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles; cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products; rulings, judgments or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; the introduction or enactment of federal or state legislation which may adversely affect Valeros business or operations; changes in the credit ratings assigned to Valeros debt securities and trade credit; changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect Valeros future results of operations and whether any forward looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Valeros forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward looking statements. Valero does not intend to update these statements unless it is required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to Valero or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. Valero undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to any such forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 26 Table of Contents OVERVIEW Generally, Valeros operations are affected by: company specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds, seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products, and industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. Valeros profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. Since approximately 50% of Valeros total throughput represents sour crude oil feedstocks, Valeros profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil discount. For the year 2004, both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best ever experienced by Valero. The strength of those positive industry fundamentals significantly enhanced Valeros results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, resulting in earnings per share of $6.53. This represented a 156% increase over the $2.55 per share earnings reported for 2003, as adjusted to reflect the effect of a two for one stock split discussed below. Valeros operating results during 2004 benefited significantly from recent investments that increased Valeros capacity to process lower cost feedstocks. In March 2004, Valero continued its strategic growth through the acquisition of the Aruba Refinery and related marine, bunkering and marketing operations. The Aruba Refinery, which processes heavy, sour crude oil, contributed approximately $290 million to Valeros operating income for 2004. In addition, the 45,000 BPD coker unit at the Texas City Refinery, which began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2003 and also processes heavier, lower cost crude oil, generated nearly $200 million of operating income in 2004. Furthermore, during 2004, Valero realized the benefits from a full year of operations of the St. Charles Refinery that was acquired on July 1, 2003. The St. Charles Refinery generated approximately $335 million of operating income in 2004. The positive 2004 results from Valeros operations, as well as certain investing and financing activities during 2004, significantly improved Valeros financial position and are expected to favorably position Valero to meet its objectives of increased shareholder return, continued growth and improved earnings stability. Valeros debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) decreased from approximately 40% at December 31, 2003 to 30.7% at the end of 2004. During 2004, Valeros debt to capitalization ratio was positively impacted by the generation of $3.0 billion of cash from operating activities and the sale of 15.6 million shares of common stock which partially funded the Aruba Acquisition. As discussed further under Outlook below, Valeros increasing ability to process heavier sour crude oils is expected to enable Valero to further benefit from wide sour crude oil discounts that Valero believes will occur. Valero believes that it is well positioned to benefit from an expected continuation of favorable refining industry fundamentals. On July 15, 2004, Valeros board of directors approved a two for one split of Valeros common stock, which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on October 7, 2004 to stockholders of record on September 23, 2004. All share and per share data (except par value) in this Form 10 K have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2004 Compared to 2003 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2004 (a) 2003 (b) Change Operating revenues (c) $ 54,618.6 $ 37,968.6 $ 16,650.0 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (c) 47,797.3 33,587.1 14,210.2 Refining operating expenses 2,140.2 1,656.0 484.2 Retail selling expenses 704.7 693.6 11.1 General and administrative expenses 378.8 299.4 79.4 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 518.6 417.1 101.5 Retail 57.8 39.6 18.2 Corporate 42.0 53.8 (11.8 ) Total costs and expenses 51,639.4 36,746.6 14,892.8 Operating income 2,979.2 1,222.0 1,757.2 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

(a) Includes the operations related to the Aruba Acquisition commencing on March 5, 2004. (b) Includes the operations of the St. Charles Refinery commencing on July 1, 2003. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, and approximately $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, as further discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) On March 18, 2003, Valeros ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in the partnership. (e) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, are based on 366 days and 365 days, respectively, which results in 183,000 barrels per day and 99,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery in 2004 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, respectively. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. Throughput volumes for the St. Charles Refinery for the 184 days of its operations during 2003 averaged 197,000 barrels per day. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (g) The Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles and Aruba Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore and Denver Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The CARBOB 87 gasoline differential for 2003 represents CARB 87 gasoline, which includes MTBE as a blending component, for the periods prior to October 31, 2003. Prices for products meeting these specifications ceased to be available after October 31, 2003. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect Valeros operations and profitability. (i) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. 31 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 44% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $1.2 billion for 2003 to $3.0 billion for 2004 and net income from $621.5 million for 2003 to $1.8 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valeros refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for Valeros refining segment was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 billion from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors: Discounts on Valeros sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2004 compared to 2003 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, (ii) high gasoline margins, which increased the demand for sweet versus sour crude oil due to the higher gasoline content of sweet crude oil, and (iii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in more gasoline production by less complex foreign refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. Gasoline margins increased in all of Valeros refining regions during 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to strong demand. Gasoline demand was up in 2004 primarily due to strong U.S. and global economic activity. Distillate margins also increased in all of Valeros refining regions in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to increased foreign and U.S. demand resulting from improved economies. Petrochemical feedstock margins improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 due to increased demand for such feedstocks resulting from a stronger worldwide economy. Valeros throughput volumes increased 327,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to incremental throughput of 117,000 barrels per day at the St. Charles Refinery, which was acquired in July 2003, and 183,000 barrels per day of throughput at the Aruba Refinery during the partial period commencing on its acquisition date of March 5, 2004. The above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of: lower margins on products such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, sulfur and petroleum coke due to an increase in the price of crude oil in 2004 compared to 2003, an approximate $20 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, a higher level of turnaround activity in 2004 compared to 2003, and approximately $231 million of hedging losses in 2004 related to forward sales of distillates and associated crude oil purchases. Refining operating expenses were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003 and the Aruba Refinery in March 2004, higher energy costs (primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices), increased maintenance expense, an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increases in insurance expense, injected catalyst, 32 Table of Contents professional fees and regulatory costs. Although total refining operating expenses increased 29% from 2003 to 2004, this increase was 9% on a per barrel basis. The lower percentage increase on a per barrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the St. Charles and Aruba Acquisitions. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects, the acquisitions of the St. Charles and Aruba Refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $175.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $36.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. Retail fuel margins in the United States decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer, and fuel sales declined in the United States due to fewer stores. Retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations. In the Northeast, operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Employee compensation and benefits increased approximately $41 million from 2003 to 2004, including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valeros equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, Valeros ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes an impairment charge of $57.2 million to write off the carrying amount of Valeros equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P., as further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of this impairment charge, other income declined $6.0 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a $17.0 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the Golden Eagle Business (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the Javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units) in August 2003. Income tax expense increased $541.2 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175% increase in income before income tax expense.

(c) On March 18, 2003, Valeros ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for its investment in the partnership. (d) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the year ended December 31, 2003, are based on 365 days, which results in 99,000 barrels per day being included for the St. Charles Refinery. Throughput volumes for the St. Charles Refinery for the 184 days of its operations during 2003 averaged 197,000 barrels per day. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) The Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs and St. Charles Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore and Denver Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.

The increases in operating income from $470.9 million for 2002 to $1.2 billion for 2003 and net income from $91.5 million for 2002 to $621.5 million for 2003 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for Valeros refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for Valeros refining segment was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $744.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 28% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and a 15% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Refining total throughput margin for 2003 increased due to the following factors: Gasoline and distillate margins improved significantly during 2003 compared to 2002 due to stronger demand and lower inventory levels. Demand for distillates improved significantly in 2003 due to colder winter weather in the Northeast and fuel switching demand in early 2003 caused by high natural gas prices. Refined product inventories were lower than the inventory levels that existed during most of 2002 due to the stronger demand combined with lower refinery production rates resulting from a large number of maintenance turnarounds in the refining industry in the first quarter of 2003 and the continuing impact of the oil workers strike in Venezuela in early 2003, which also reduced production rates. The high inventory levels in 2002 were caused by weaker economic conditions, an unusually warm winter in the northeastern part of the United States and in Europe, and lower jet fuel demand. Discounts on Valeros sour crude oil feedstocks increased for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due mainly to the resumption of higher crude oil production rates by OPEC. Valeros throughput volumes for 2003 increased from 2002 due to incremental volumes from the St. Charles Refinery commencing in July 2003 and increased refinery utilization rates during 2003, as eight of Valeros refineries were affected by turnaround activities during 2002. Also during 2002, production at several refineries was reduced at various times during the year due to uneconomic operating conditions. The above increases in throughput margin for 2003 were partially offset by the effects of: a net benefit of approximately $76 million in 2002 resulting from the settlement of petroleum products purchase agreements and related hedges, a $39 million benefit from the liquidation of certain of Valeros LIFO inventories in 2002, an approximate $62 million reduction resulting from Valero ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, and an increase in unplanned downtime during 2003 at certain of Valeros refineries. Refining operating expenses were 24% higher for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 due primarily to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003, higher energy costs (primarily related to natural gas), an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increased maintenance expense associated with unplanned downtime. Although total operating expenses increased 24%, the increase in refining operating expenses on a per barrel basis was 8% from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in throughput volumes for the reasons discussed above. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 7% from the year ended 38 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to depreciation expense related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $211.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $83.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of higher retail fuel margins in both the U.S. and Northeast retail systems and operational improvements. During 2003, Valero continued to implement its U.S. retail strategy that commenced in 2002 of investing in certain key stores and disposing of certain underperforming or non strategic stores. During 2003, Valero reimaged and upgraded 150 stores and closed or divested 122 stores. These changes contributed to improved operating income for the retail segment in 2003. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Part of the increase was due to the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million in 2003 as a result of improved financial performance in 2003 as compared to 2002. Also, in December 2003, a $25.8 million impairment charge was recognized and reflected in corporate depreciation and amortization expense to write down the carrying amount of Valeros former headquarters facilities to fair value less selling costs, as described further in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits expenses, ad valorem taxes and litigation costs. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents Valeros equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero L.P. and began using the equity method to account for its investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that Valero consolidated such operations. The increase in other income, net from 2002 to 2003 was due mainly to a gain of $17.0 million related to the sale of notes receivable from Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company (Tesoro) in connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in 2002. This gain was offset by a $7.1 million decrease in equity income from joint ventures and $4.2 million of expense resulting from the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation. Net interest and debt expense decreased $24.4 million from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in debt levels from $5 billion as of December 31, 2002 to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2003 and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to a larger capital investment program. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts decreased $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% TOPrS in June 2003 and the settlement of the PEPS Units in August 2003. Income tax expense increased from $58.2 million in 2002 to $365.1 million in 2003 due to the significant increase in pre tax income. 39 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Sour crude oil discounts in January and February 2005 have improved significantly from early 2004 levels and are expected to remain strong throughout 2005. Two primary factors support an expectation of continuing wide sour crude oil discounts. First, a projected increase in the global demand for crude oil in 2005 is expected to result in higher production of medium and heavy sour crude oils. However, global conversion capacity to process this incremental sour crude oil is limited. Lack of conversion capacity will result in higher yields of residual fuel by product for which demand is declining due to tighter environmental standards. Sour crude oil discounts will stay wide to justify the yield of low value resid in low conversion refineries. Refineries with conversion capacity to upgrade the resid will benefit. Secondly, as refiners seek to meet the requirements of the global movement to cleaner fuels, the demand for sweet crude oils continues to grow due to their higher yield of clean products, leading to increased prices for sweeter crude oils. In addition to the very favorable outlook for sour crude oil discounts, the outlook for refined product margins appears favorable as a result of continued strong demand for both gasoline and diesel. The favorable factors that were in place in 2004 are expected to continue in 2005 as worldwide demand continues to exceed production capacity. In addition, refined product margins should benefit from a further tightening of fuel specifications worldwide, making it more difficult for foreign refiners to meet the U.S. specifications on imports. Operationally, Valero expects to benefit during 2005 from the full year effect of the Aruba Refinery that was acquired in March 2004 and also expects to benefit from strategic projects that were completed during 2004 and will be completed during 2005, particularly those projects that further Valeros strategy of processing heavier and more sour feedstocks. For 2005, throughput volume is expected to increase approximately 100,000 BPD compared to 2004. As a result of these factors, Valero believes it is well positioned to capitalize on the expected positive industry fundamentals and the resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.2 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due to the significant increase in income in 2004 as described above under Results of Operations, partially offset by a $226.6 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years. As reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the year ended December 31, 2004, working capital requirements decreased by approximately $203 million, largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities, while 2003 benefited primarily from a $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under Valeros accounts receivable sales program. Other significant working capital changes for 2004, which substantially offset each other, included increases in receivables, accounts payable, inventories and taxes other than income taxes. All of these changes were attributable to increases in both throughput volumes and commodity prices from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004. Valeros cash balance increased by $494.4 million during 2004. 40 Table of Contents In addition to the $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2004, including proceeds of approximately $406 million from the sale of common stock, approximately $135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to Valeros benefit plans, approximately $109 million of proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment, and approximately $64 million of net borrowings (borrowings net of debt repayments). Valero used these proceeds to: fund $1.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; exercise options under structured lease arrangements to purchase $567.1 million of leased property; fund the Aruba Acquisition for $541.3 million, net of cash acquired; purchase 9.7 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $317.4 million; fund contingent payments in connection with acquisitions of $53.4 million; invest $35.9 million in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and pay common and preferred stock dividends of $79.4 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.8 billion compared to $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.5 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the significant increase in income in 2003 as described above under Results of Operations and changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during 2003 and 2002 as further reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary cause of the change in working capital between the years related to changes in the amount of receivables sold under Valeros accounts receivable sales program. During 2003, the amount of receivables sold under the program increased by $350 million, while during 2002, working capital was increased by a $123 million decrease in the amount of receivables sold. For the year ended December 31, 2003, in addition to the $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold, changes in working capital included a $415.8 million increase in accounts payable, which more than offset a $270.0 million increase in inventories. Inventories increased due to higher volumes of feedstock and refined product inventories on hand at December 31, 2003 attributable primarily to (i) lower than normal feedstock levels at December 31, 2002 resulting from the effect of the oil workers strike in Venezuela and (ii) increased refinery utilization rates during 2003. In addition to the $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, Valero generated cash from various other sources during 2003, including proceeds of approximately $300 million from the issuance of senior notes in June, $250.3 million from the issuance of common stock in March, $379.9 million from the contribution and sale of certain assets to Valero L.P., $89.6 million from the sale of Tesoro notes held by Valero, and $94.2 million from the disposition of certain parts of its home heating oil business and other property, plant and equipment. Valero used these proceeds to: fund $1.1 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; exercise options under certain structured lease arrangements to purchase $275.0 million of property and exercise an option under certain capital leases to purchase for $289.3 million the Corpus Christi East Refinery and related refined product logistics assets; fund part of the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery for $309.0 million; redeem the $200 million of TOPrS and $100 million of 8% debentures; fund a $106.1 million investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $50.6 million of earn out payments and approximately $35.0 million of other acquisitions; and pay common and preferred stock dividends of $50.6 million. 41 Table of Contents The remaining proceeds were used primarily to reduce borrowings under Valeros committed and uncommitted bank credit facilities. Aruba Acquisition On March 5, 2004, Valero completed the purchase of El Paso Corporations Aruba Refinery and related marine, bunkering and marketing operations. Consideration for the purchase consisted of $200 million in existing cash, approximately $27 million in borrowings under Valeros existing bank credit facilities and approximately $406 million in net proceeds from the sale of 15.6 million shares of Valero common stock. In addition, upon termination on May 4, 2004 of an agreement in existence with a third party marketing firm on the date of acquisition, Valero paid $67.8 million related to certain refined product inventories owned by the third party marketing firm. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero expended approximately $1.6 billion for capital investments of which $1.3 billion related to capital expenditures (including approximately $523 million for environmental projects and approximately $360 million for strategic projects) and $304.2 million related to deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004 included approximately $184 million to fund construction of gasoline desulfurization units at the Paulsboro, St. Charles, Quebec, Houston, McKee and Corpus Christi West Refineries in response to Tier II regulations. In addition to the $1.6 billion of capital investments discussed above, $567.1 million was expended for the purchase of various leased properties, which were previously subject to structured lease arrangements (see Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $35.9 million was invested in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, $53.4 million of payments were made related to the contingent earn out agreements discussed below and other contingencies related to acquisitions, and $541.3 million of cash was expended on the Aruba Acquisition. In connection with Valeros acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Any payments due under these earn out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2004, Valero made an earn out payment of $35.0 million related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc. In January 2005, Valero made an earn out payment of $50.0 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2005, an earn out payment related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition of $35 million would be due in May 2005. For 2005, Valero expects to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.7 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $900 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $300 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. Valero continuously evaluates its capital budget and makes changes as economic conditions warrant. In connection with Valero L.P.s proposed merger of Kaneb Services LLC and Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P., Valero expects to contribute approximately $28 million to Valero L.P. to maintain Valeros 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Valeros contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 409.6 $ 259.5 $ 329.0 $ 6.5 $ 208.5 $ 3,163.5 $ 4,376.6 Capital lease obligations 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 3.7 11.2 Operating lease obligations 195.8 169.0 147.1 121.2 87.0 196.4 916.5 Purchase obligations 8,582.1 1,646.3 1,169.1 1,068.8 1,049.4 1,009.8 14,525.5 Total $ 9,189.0 $ 2,076.3 $ 1,646.7 $ 1,198.0 $ 1,346.4 $ 4,373.4 $ 19,829.8 Long Term Debt Payments for long term debt are at stated values. On March 22, 2004, Valero issued $200 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due April 1, 2009 and $200 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due April 1, 2014 under its prior shelf registration statement. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities. On March 29, 2004, Valero borrowed $200 million under a five year term loan with a maturity date of March 31, 2009 and bearing interest based on Valeros debt rating. Principal payments were scheduled to begin March 2007 with a $50.0 million principal payment due at that time and semi annual payments of $37.5 million due thereafter until maturity. The net proceeds from this borrowing were used to repay borrowings under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities. In December 2004, Valero repaid the entire outstanding balance of the term loan. None of Valeros agreements have rating agency triggers that would automatically require Valero to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of Valeros senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of Valeros bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. Operating Lease Obligations Valeros operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by Valero under subleases. Structured Lease Arrangements During the first quarter of 2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of the four structured lease arrangements that existed as of December 31, 2003. Valero purchased the leased properties for $567.1 million, using borrowings under its existing bank credit facilities. Subsequent to this purchase, Valero issued $400 million of Senior Notes and borrowed $200 million under a bank term loan, which are described above under Long Term Debt, to refinance these borrowings under its existing bank credit facilities and to take advantage of favorable treasury rates. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. Valero has various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply 43 Table of Contents arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its refineries. Substantially all of Valeros purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on Valeros usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2004, Valeros short term and long term purchase obligations increased by approximately $8.4 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2003. The increase is almost entirely attributable to an increase in obligations under crude oil supply contracts resulting mainly from significantly higher crude oil prices as of December 31, 2004 and new contracts in 2004, including contracts for feedstock to supply the Aruba Refinery which was acquired in March 2004. Valero has not made in the past, nor does it expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that it has not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. Other Long term Liabilities Valeros other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2004. However, certain expected payments related to Valeros anticipated pension contribution in 2005 and its other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2004, Valeros committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): Borrowing Capacity Expiration 3 year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 5 year revolving credit facility $ 750.0 December 2006 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn $ 115.0 July 2005 Valeros other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Total Amounts 2005 2006 2007 Committed Letters of credit $ 503.7 $ $ 0.1 $ 503.8 As of December 31, 2004, Valero had $218.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $8.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under its Canadian committed revolving credit facility and $278.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under its 3 year and 5 year committed revolving credit facilities. Under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities definitions, Valeros debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 30.7% as of December 31, 2004 compared to 40.3% as of December 31, 2003. Valeros refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact Valeros overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, Valero believes that its portfolio of accounts 44 Table of Contents receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, Valero has not had any significant problems collecting its accounts receivable. On August 25, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a new shelf registration statement on Form S 3 filed by Valero to register $3.5 billion of securities for potential future issuance. Valero believes it has sufficient funds from operations, and to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund its ongoing operating requirements. Valero expects that, to the extent necessary, it can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms acceptable to Valero. Equity On February 5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 15.6 million shares of its common stock, which included 2.0 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter, at a price of $26.63 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriters discount, commissions and other issuance costs, of $405.8 million. These shares were issued under Valeros prior shelf registration statement to partially fund the Aruba Acquisition. Valero purchases shares of its common stock in open market transactions to meet its obligations under employee benefit plans. Valero also purchases shares of its common stock from its employees and non employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During 2004, Valero purchased 9.7 million shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of $317.4 million. Through February 2005, Valero has purchased an additional 1.4 million common shares under these programs at a cost of $77.6 million. No shares were purchased during 2004 or through February 2005 under Valeros $400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on December 3, 2001. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2004, Valero contributed approximately $73 million to its qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.75% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the assets in Valeros qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 73% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2004. However, the qualified pension plans were more than 90% funded based on their current liability, which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its qualified pension plans during 2005 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its qualified pension plans during 2005. Environmental Matters Valero is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of Valeros refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding Valeros environmental matters, including a discussion of capital expenditures related to environmental regulations, see Environmental Matters in Items 1 2, Business Properties and Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2004, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility with three third party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600 million of eligible trade and credit card receivables, which matures in October 2005. Valero uses this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, a wholly owned subsidiary of Valero sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third party financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions was $600 million. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require Valero to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on Valeros consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2004, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on Valeros liquidity and would not have affected Valeros ability to comply with restrictive covenants in its credit facilities. Valero is not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. Valeros board of directors has approved an extension of this program, which is subject to finalization of the terms of the agreements with the third party financial institutions. Guarantees In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in May 2002, Valero guaranteed certain lease payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $34 million as of December 31, 2004. This lease expires in 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2004, Valero was not required to, and did not, make any payments under this guarantee. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for Valeros financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to have, a material effect on Valeros consolidated financial statements, except as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about Valeros critical accounting policies, including separate identification of those involving critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes Valeros significant accounting policies. 46 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on Valeros consolidated financial position and results of operations. Valero believes that all of its estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting Valeros earnings. Valeros impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with Valeros business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Valero recognized an impairment charge of $57.2 million in 2004 related to its equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and an impairment charge of $25.8 million in 2003 related to Valeros former headquarters buildings as discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2002. Environmental Liabilities Valeros operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as Valeros own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of Valeros obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes. 47 Table of Contents The balance of and changes in Valeros accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Valero believes that it has adequately accrued for its environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Valero has significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside Valeros control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on Moodys published Aa corporate bond rate as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for Valero by an outside consultant using historical market index data from 1926 through 2001 with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, representative of the asset mix in Valeros qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in Valeros consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2005 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in benefit obligation: Discount rate decrease $ 42.8 $ 9.4 Compensation rate increase 16.2 Health care cost trend rate increase 3.4 Increase in expense: Discount rate decrease 6.3 0.8 Expected return on plan assets decrease 1.4 Compensation rate increase 3.6 Health care cost trend rate increase 0.4 Other Critical Accounting Policies The following accounting policies are less sensitive to management estimates but are presented to enable a more complete understanding and comparability of Valeros more significant accounting policies. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing and refined products are determined under the last in, first out (LIFO) method of inventory pricing. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined under the weighted average cost method. Valero utilizes the dollar value LIFO method and uses average purchase prices during the year to value any increments to its LIFO inventory. Property, Plant and Equipment Valero records depreciation expense on its property, plant and equipment primarily using the composite method of depreciation. Under the composite method of depreciation, the costs of minor property units, net of salvage value, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation while gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units are recorded in income. Although accounting for property, plant 48 Table of Contents and equipment requires various judgments and estimates, including a determination of remaining useful lives, salvage values and the significance of dispositions in determining the accounting for gains and losses, changes in such estimates for any particular asset are not expected to significantly affect Valeros results of operations or financial condition due to Valeros use of the composite method of depreciation. Refinery Turnaround Costs Refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at Valeros refineries, are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs. The frequency of refinery turnarounds varies with each refinery operating unit. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had $320.4 million of deferred refinery turnaround costs included in its consolidated balance sheet. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, Valero must assess the likelihood that its deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent Valero believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. Valero had a valuation allowance recorded as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on Valeros estimates of taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from the estimates or Valero adjusts the estimates in future periods, Valero may need to revise the valuation allowance. However, significant changes in such valuation allowances have not had in the past, and are not expected to have in the future, a material effect on Valeros financial condition or results of operations. The net deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $526.7 million and $600.1 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $83.3 million and $82.6 million, respectively. Asset Retirement Obligations Effective January 1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which established accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost. An entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit adjusted risk free rate, and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation. These estimates and assumptions are very subjective. However, Valero believes it has adequately accrued for its asset retirement obligations and that changes in estimates in future periods would not have a significant effect on Valeros financial condition or results of operations. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an explanation of the effect of Valeros adoption of Statement No. 143. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). Valero also uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases that do not receive hedge accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in Valeros hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. Valeros positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valeros stated risk management policy which has been approved by Valeros board of directors. The following tables provide information about Valeros derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, economic hedges held to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, and trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. The gain (loss) on swaps is equal to the fair value amount and represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price times the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the gain (loss) represents (i) the excess of the fair value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the fair value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2004 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 17,423 $ 46.39 N/A $ 808.2 $ 772.4 $ (35.8 ) Futures short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 26,726 N/A $ 46.00 1,229.3 1,190.0 39.3 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 67,378 37.05 42.84 N/A 390.3 390.3 Swaps short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 67,378 48.54 41.65 N/A (464.1 ) (464.1 ) Futures long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 28,354 45.39 N/A 1,287.0 1,286.1 (0.9 ) Futures short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 23,152 N/A 45.95 1,063.7 1,066.6 (2.9 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 3,505 11.49 11.37 N/A (0.4 ) (0.4 ) Swaps short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 4,239 10.10 10.25 N/A 0.6 0.6 Futures long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 19,230 46.90 N/A 901.9 896.2 (5.7 ) Futures short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 17,787 N/A 47.55 845.8 823.8 22.0 Options long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 1,000 35.00 N/A 2.8 4.7 1.9 Options short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 4,201 N/A 21.69 (2.4 ) 2.4 (4.8 ) Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 25,460 35.15 39.17 N/A 102.4 102.4 Swaps short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 23,585 42.66 38.20 N/A (105.3 ) (105.3 ) Futures long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 15,956 45.09 N/A 719.5 725.4 5.9 2005 (natural gas) 210 7.04 N/A 1.5 1.3 (0.2 ) Futures short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 21,781 N/A 45.81 997.7 1,002.8 (5.1 ) 2005 (natural gas) 210 N/A 6.38 1.4 1.3 0.1 Options long: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 1,550 48.35 N/A 1.3 1.6 0.3 Options short: 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 150 N/A 10.55 (0.2 ) (0.4 ) 0.2 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2003 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Contract Pay Receive Contract Fair Gain Volumes Price Price Value Value (Loss) Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 26,464 $ 31.72 N/A $ 839.4 $ 860.1 $ 20.7 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 2 29.84 N/A Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 36,110 N/A $ 31.59 1,140.7 1,180.5 (39.8 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,020 27.89 30.38 N/A 152.0 152.0 2004 (natural gas) 915 5.66 6.08 N/A 0.4 0.4 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 61,520 34.01 31.62 N/A (147.3 ) (147.3 ) 2004 (natural gas) 458 6.08 5.61 N/A (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 17,266 32.05 N/A 553.5 567.2 13.7 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 14,600 N/A 33.35 487.0 502.1 (15.1 ) 2004 (natural gas) 540 N/A 5.24 2.8 3.3 (0.5 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 2,658 10.73 10.97 N/A 0.6 0.6 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,428 1.66 2.02 N/A 2.6 2.6 Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 16,604 37.25 N/A 618.5 622.9 4.4 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 19,788 N/A 36.32 718.7 730.1 (11.4 ) Options long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 24,719 9.72 N/A 7.0 12.5 5.5 2004 (natural gas) 913 5.05 N/A 0.5 0.9 0.4 Options short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 34,269 N/A 9.68 (13.7 ) (13.2 ) (0.5 ) Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,330 17.09 18.43 N/A 11.2 11.2 Swaps short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 8,675 18.99 17.75 N/A (10.7 ) (10.7 ) Futures long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 22,396 31.21 N/A 699.1 724.2 25.1 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 26.46 N/A 5.3 5.7 0.4 2004 (natural gas) 300 5.08 N/A 1.5 1.7 0.2 Futures short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 21,416 N/A 31.79 680.8 703.6 (22.8 ) 2005 (crude oil and refined products) 200 N/A 31.71 6.3 6.7 (0.4 ) 2004 (natural gas) 300 N/A 5.75 1.7 1.8 (0.1 ) Options long: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 12,671 13.62 N/A 3.7 8.0 4.3 Options short: 2004 (crude oil and refined products) 7,647 N/A 8.56 (3.0 ) (0.7 ) (2.3 ) 52 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK Valeros primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to its long term debt obligations. Valero manages its exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, Valero utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of its exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about Valeros long term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates.

These interest rate swap contracts currently have an estimated pay rate of 3.6% and hedge $200 million of debt with a fixed interest rate of 4.75%. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Valero enters into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. During May 2002, Valero entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in its Canadian operations that Valero intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, Valero sold $400 million of Canadian dollars and bought $253.4 million of U.S. dollars. In February 2004, Valero redeemed its remaining balance of this investment in its Canadian operations. As a result, Valero liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by Valero of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had other commitments to purchase $5.0 million of U.S. dollars. Valeros market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 6, 2005. As of December 31, 2004, Valero had also entered into a foreign currency exchange contract relating to the purchase of commercial paper, which requires Valero to sell $20.0 million of U.S. dollars in May 2005. The effect on this contract of a hypothetical 10% change in the year end exchange rate would be approximately $2 million. 54 Table of Contents
