Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance. The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, CARB gasoline, the Tier II gasoline and distillate standards and the Maximum Available Control Technology rule under the Clean Air Act, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations. A significant portion of our feedstock requirements are satisfied through supplies originating in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Ecuador and Africa. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. 12 Table of Contents Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage. The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with numerous other companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. Our operations expose us to many operating risks, not all of which are insured. Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. They are also subject to the additional hazards of loss from severe weather conditions. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 13 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We hereby incorporate by reference into this Item the environmental disclosures contained in the following sections of this report: Item 1 under the caption Risk Factors Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance, Item 3 Legal Proceedings under the caption Environmental Enforcement Matters, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Environmental Matters, and

We market refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a network of approximately 5,000 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States, Canada and Aruba under various brand names including primarily Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar and Beacon. During the second quarter of 2005, we announced our plan to retire the Diamond Shamrock brand and convert those U.S. retail and wholesale sites to the Valero brand. This program is progressing well, with 385 sites having been converted to the Valero brand by the end of 2005 and 894 sites remaining to be rebranded during 2006 and early 2007. Our operations are affected by: company specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds; seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products; and industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. Since almost 70% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil discount. During 2005, we benefited from even stronger industry fundamentals than the already strong industry fundamentals experienced in 2004. In reporting our results for 2004, we indicated that both refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts were the best we had ever experienced. During 2005, gasoline and distillate margins improved in all four of our refining regions, with overall distillate margins more than double the 2004 margins. In addition, the sour crude oil discount increased more than 30%. This improvement in gasoline and distillate margins combined with the strong sour crude oil discounts contributed to a significant increase in operating results in 2005 compared to the prior year, resulting in earnings per share of $6.10 for 2005, or an 87% increase over the $3.27 earnings per share reported for 2004. On September 1, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Premcor. Premcor owned and operated refineries in Port Arthur, Texas, Lima, Ohio, Memphis, Tennessee, and Delaware City, Delaware, with a combined crude oil throughput capacity of approximately 800,000 barrels per day. We benefited from the addition of the four former Premcor refineries, which generated approximately $810 million of operating income during the last four months of 2005. The positive industry fundamentals experienced during the year ended December 31, 2005, combined with the incremental operating income generated from the Premcor Acquisition, resulted in net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 that was approximately double the net income reported for the year ended December 31, 2004. We reported net income of $3.6 billion for 2005, compared to $1.8 billion for 2004. Our debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) decreased approximately 6% during 2005 to 24.8%. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2005 Compared to 2004 Financial Highlights (millions of

A $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded under our LIFO accounting policy was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (b) Includes the operations related to the Aruba Acquisition commencing on March 5, 2004. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 and approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality or grade requirements. For further explanation of this accounting treatment, see the discussion about EITF No. 04 13 in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (e) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the year ended December 31, 2004 are based on 366 days, which results in 183,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2004. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. (f) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke and asphalt. (g) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis and Lima Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec, Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000 and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent and Northeast regions. (i) The information presented for the Mid Continent region includes the operations of the Denver Refinery through May 31, 2005, the date of our sale of this facility to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. (Suncor). Throughput volumes for the Mid Continent region 27 Table of Contents include 15,000 and 37,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (j) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (k) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 50% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 83%, from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment, partially offset by a $34 million decrease in the retail segment and a $107 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of $3.70 per barrel, or 50%, and a 15% increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $989 million. Refining total throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors: Distillate margins increased significantly in all of our refining regions during 2005 compared to 2004, with margins in the Gulf Coast region almost triple the margins in 2004 and margins in the Mid Continent and Northeast regions more than double 2004 margins. The improvement in distillate margins was due to increased foreign and U.S. demand, resulting from improved U.S. and global economies and higher demand for on road diesel and jet fuel. In addition, both gasoline and distillate margins increased significantly in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which reduced the supply of refined products as refineries along the Gulf Coast reduced or shut down their operations because of the hurricanes. Discounts on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2005 compared to 2004 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required most refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, and (ii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. Throughput volumes increased 326,000 barrels per day in 2005 compared to 2004 due mainly to throughput of 247,000 barrels per day at the four refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005, incremental throughput of 40,000 barrels per day at the Aruba Refinery, which was acquired in March 2004, and lower volumes in 2004 due to turnarounds at the St. Charles, Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. The above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of: lower margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke, sulfur, No. 6 fuel oil, asphalt and propylene due to a significant increase in the price of crude oil from 2004 to 2005, and 28 Table of Contents increased pre tax losses of approximately $295 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 37% higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to $420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the Premcor Acquisition, a full year of operations of the Aruba Refinery, and increases in energy costs, employee compensation expense and maintenance expense. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39% from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005, implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, a $15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the write off of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand. Retail Retail operating income was $141 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 19% between the periods. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the U.S. and Northeast as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees. In addition, Northeast selling expenses increased $15 million due to an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $107 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits. These increases were mainly related to the recognition of increased variable compensation expense, resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005, and expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. These increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a California excise tax dispute. Other income (expense), net improved $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a $55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in Javelina Company and Javelina Pipeline Company in November 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. This combined effect, as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances, was partially offset by our 50% interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the Premcor Acquisition. However, the increased interest incurred was almost entirely offset by increased capitalized interest due to an increase in capital projects, including those at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent book to tax differences, 29 Table of Contents which included a deduction from income in 2005 for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, as allowed under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 2004 Compared to 2003 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2004 (a) 2003 (b) Change Operating revenues (c) $ 54,619 $ 37,969 $ 16,650 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (c) 47,797 33,587 14,210 Refining operating expenses 2,141 1,656 485 Retail selling expenses 705 694 11 General and administrative expenses 379 299 80 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 518 417 101 Retail 58 40 18 Corporate 42 54 (12 ) Total costs and expenses 51,640 36,747 14,893 Operating income 2,979 1,222 1,757 Equity in earnings of Valero L.P.

(c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 and approximately $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality or grade requirements. For further explanation of this accounting treatment, see the discussion about EITF No. 04 13 in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) On March 18, 2003, our ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, we ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for our investment in the partnership. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are based on 366 days and 365 days, respectively, which results in 183,000 barrels per day and 99,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery in 2004 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, respectively. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. Throughput volumes for the St. Charles Refinery for the 184 days of its operations during 2003 averaged 197,000 barrels per day. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke and asphalt. (h) The Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles and Aruba Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore and Denver Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The CARBOB 87 gasoline differential for 2003 represents CARB 87 gasoline, which includes MTBE as a blending component, for the periods prior to October 31, 2003. Prices for products meeting these specifications ceased to be available after October 31, 2003. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented 33 Table of Contents to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 44% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. The increases in operating income from $1.2 billion for 2003 to $3.0 billion for 2004 and net income from $622 million for 2003 to $1.8 billion for 2004 were attributable primarily to improved fundamentals for our refining segment as discussed below. Refining Operating income for our refining segment was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 billion from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in refining segment operating income resulted primarily from a 45% increase in refining throughput margin per barrel and an 18% increase in refining throughput volumes, partially offset by a $586 million increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense). Refining total throughput margin for 2004 increased due to the following factors: Discounts on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2004 compared to 2003 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, discounts on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, (ii) high gasoline margins, which increased the demand for sweet versus sour crude oil due to the higher gasoline content of sweet crude oil, and (iii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in more gasoline production by less complex foreign refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. Gasoline margins increased in all of our refining regions during 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to strong demand. Gasoline demand was up in 2004 primarily due to strong U.S. and global economic activity. Distillate margins also increased in all of our refining regions in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to increased foreign and U.S. demand resulting from improved economies. Petrochemical feedstock margins improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 due to increased demand for such feedstocks resulting from a stronger worldwide economy. Our throughput volumes increased 327,000 barrels per day in 2004 compared to 2003 due mainly to incremental throughput of 117,000 barrels per day at the St. Charles Refinery, which was acquired in July 2003, and 183,000 barrels per day of throughput at the Aruba Refinery during the partial period commencing on its acquisition date of March 5, 2004. The above increases in throughput margin for 2004 were partially offset by the effects of: lower margins on products such as asphalt, No. 6 fuel oil, sulfur and petroleum coke due to an increase in the price of crude oil in 2004 compared to 2003, an approximate $20 million reduction resulting from our ceasing consolidation of Valero L.P. commencing in March 2003, a higher level of turnaround activity in 2004 compared to 2003, and approximately $230 million of pre tax losses in 2004 on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. 34 Table of Contents Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to the acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in July 2003 and the Aruba Refinery in March 2004, higher energy costs (primarily related to an increase in natural gas prices), increased maintenance expense, an increase in employee compensation and benefits expense including increased variable and incentive compensation, and increases in insurance expense, injected catalyst, professional fees and regulatory costs. Although total refining operating expenses increased 29% from 2003 to 2004, this increase was 9% on a per barrel basis. The lower percentage increase on a per barrel basis was due to the throughput increases that resulted from the St. Charles and Aruba Acquisitions. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to the implementation of new capital projects, the acquisitions of the St. Charles and Aruba Refineries and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $37 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. Retail fuel margins in the United States decreased due to a rise in crude oil prices during 2004 which could not be fully passed through to the consumer, and fuel sales declined in the United States due to fewer stores. Retail depreciation and amortization expense was higher in 2004 due mainly to gains recognized in 2003 on the disposition of certain home heating oil businesses and service stations. In the Northeast, operating income declined due mainly to an increase in selling expenses resulting primarily from a significant increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate from 2003 to 2004. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Employee compensation and benefits increased approximately $41 million from 2003 to 2004, including the recognition of increased variable and incentive compensation expense of approximately $21 million as a result of improved financial performance between the respective years. The remainder of the increase was attributable primarily to costs related to legal and regulatory matters and increased charitable contributions. Equity in earnings of Valero L.P. represents our equity interest in the earnings of Valero L.P. after March 18, 2003. On March 18, 2003, our ownership interest in Valero L.P. decreased from 73.6% to 49.5%. As a result of this decrease in ownership of Valero L.P. combined with certain other partnership governance changes, we ceased consolidating Valero L.P. as of that date and began using the equity method to account for our investment in Valero L.P. The minority interest in net income of Valero L.P. represented the minority unitholders share of the net income of Valero L.P. during the periods that we consolidated such operations. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes an impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P., as further described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the effect of this impairment charge, other income declined $6 million due primarily to the nonrecurrence of a $17 million gain recognized in 2003 related to the sale of certain notes received as partial consideration for the 2002 sale of the Golden Eagle Business (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $10 million increase in equity income in 2004 from the Javelina joint venture due to higher natural gas liquids prices. 35 Table of Contents Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary trusts ceased during 2003 due to the redemption of the 8.32% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (TOPrS) in June 2003 and the settlement of the Premium Equity Participating Security Units (PEPS Units) in August 2003. Income tax expense increased $541 million from 2003 to 2004 mainly as a result of a 175% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2003 due mainly to income contributed by the Aruba Refinery in 2004, the operations of which are non taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. OUTLOOK In January 2006, we saw a continuation of the positive refining industry fundamentals that we experienced in 2005. Refined product margins for January 2006 were well above historical five year averages. For example, the Gulf Coast gasoline margin for January 2006 was $6.66 per barrel compared to the historical January average for the last five years of $5.18 per barrel, while the Gulf Coast distillate margin was $7.84 per barrel, $3.23 per barrel above the historical January average for the last five years of $4.61 per barrel. Despite a drop in refined product margins in February due primarily to an unusually warm winter and record imports of winter grade gasolines, we expect these strong fundamentals to remain in place throughout 2006. Our outlook for gasoline margins is positive as we expect demand for gasoline during 2006 to remain strong due to continuing strong economic activity in the United States and abroad. We expect that the supply required to satisfy the high demand will be tight for several reasons. First, gasoline inventories in early 2006 on a days of supply basis have been low for this time of year. Second, a very high level of turnaround activity is projected for the first half of 2006 for the U.S. refining industry, which should reduce gasoline production. Third, the industrys typical switch to summer grade gasoline in early March will be complicated this year by the lower sulfur content specifications that have taken effect. Fourth, the effective elimination by Congress of MTBE in the gasoline pool by early in the second quarter of 2006 is expected to result in a loss of gasoline production that will have to be made up through increased imports or the blending of higher cost blendstocks, either of which will require higher margins to attract the necessary supply. And finally, a limited amount of new refining capacity in the U.S. is expected to come on line in 2006. The outlook for low sulfur distillate margins is also favorable. Inventories of on road diesel on a days of supply basis are near historical five year lows. We expect that supplies of on road diesel will remain tight throughout 2006 as demand is expected to exceed production capacity, particularly in light of the EPAs tightening diesel fuel specifications that take effect on June 1, 2006. Sour crude oil discounts are also expected to remain wide for the foreseeable future. The combination of high refined product margins and the new low sulfur specifications for refined products has resulted in increased demand for sweet crude oil versus sour crude oil due to its higher yield of light products and lower sulfur content. Higher utilization rates globally by certain less complex refineries have also resulted in the production of more residual fuel oil. The increased supply of resid supports wider discounts for heavy sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute resid for a portion of their heavy sour crude oil purchases if resid becomes more economic to process than crude oil. Overall, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals and our resulting favorable outlook for refined product margins and sour crude oil discounts during 2006. 36 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.8 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $2.8 billion. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations and an $879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years, as reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, working capital was positively impacted by a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The net cash generated from operating activities during 2005, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from debt borrowings, $428 million of available cash on hand, $227 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans, $78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the Javelina joint venture and $45 million of proceeds from the sale of the Denver Refinery, and a $38 million net return of investment from the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint ventures debt in June 2005, were used mainly to: fund $2.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; make debt repayments of $2.4 billion; fund $2.3 billion of the Premcor Acquisition, net of cash acquired; purchase 13 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $571 million; fund contingent payments of $85 million in connection with prior acquisitions; fund certain minor acquisitions for $62 million; make a general partner contribution to Valero L.P. of $29 million; and pay common and preferred stock dividends of $106 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $1.2 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income in 2004 as described above under Results of Operations, partially offset by a $226 million decrease in the amount of favorable working capital changes between the years. As reflected in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the year ended December 31, 2004, working capital requirements decreased by $203 million compared to a $429 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease for 2004 was largely due to a significant increase in current income tax liabilities, while 2003 benefited primarily from a $350 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program. In addition to the $3.0 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, we generated cash from various other sources during 2004, including proceeds of $406 million from the sale of common stock, $135 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our benefit plans, $108 million of proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment, and $64 million of net borrowings (borrowings net of debt repayments). We used these proceeds to: fund $1.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; exercise options under structured lease arrangements to purchase $567 million of leased property; fund the Aruba Acquisition for $541 million, net of cash acquired; 37 Table of Contents purchase 19 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $318 million; fund contingent payments in connection with prior acquisitions of $53 million; invest $36 million in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project (described further in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); pay common and preferred stock dividends of $79 million; and increase our cash balance by $495 million. Capital Investments On September 1, 2005, we completed our merger with Premcor. We paid the $3.4 billion cash portion of the merger consideration from available cash and proceeds from a $1.5 billion five year bank term loan due in August 2010 (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the $1.5 billion term loan). In addition, we assumed Premcors existing debt, which had a fair value of $1.9 billion as of September 1, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred $2.1 billion for capital expenditures and $441 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2005 included approximately $1.1 billion of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, $85 million of contingent earn out payments were made, $62 million was expended for minor acquisitions, $29 million was contributed to Valero L.P. in conjunction with its acquisition of Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P. (Kaneb Partners) and Kaneb Services LLC (together, the Kaneb Acquisition) to maintain our 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P., and $20 million was expended on the conversion of U.S. retail and wholesale sites from the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand (with approximately $45 million of additional spending anticipated during 2006 and early 2007 on this program). In connection with our acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcors obligation under an earn out contingency agreement related to Premcors acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva). Under this agreement, Motiva is entitled to receive two separate annual earn out contingency payments depending on (a) the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May 2007, and (b) the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through May 2006. Any payments due under all of these earn out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2005, we made earn out payments of $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and $35 million related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition. In January 2006, we made an earn out payment of $50 million related to the St. Charles Acquisition. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2006, earn out payments of $26 million (maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the Basis Petroleum Acquisition and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2006. For 2006, we expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion for capital investments, including approximately $3.0 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $1.3 billion of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 220 $ 287 $ 6 $ 209 $ 208 $ 4,392 $ 5,322 Capital lease obligations 6 7 6 7 6 39 71 Operating lease obligations 320 285 226 160 96 443 1,530 Purchase obligations 17,304 6,258 5,735 1,489 303 2,555 33,644 Total $ 17,850 $ 6,837 $ 5,973 $ 1,865 $ 613 $ 7,429 $ 40,567 Long Term Debt Payments for long term debt are at stated values. In conjunction with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed debt with a fair value of $1.9 billion and $14 million of capital lease obligations. In August 2005, we entered into a $1.5 billion term bank loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Premcor Acquisition, which was fully repaid by December 31, 2005. During January 2005, we repurchased $40 million of our 7.375% notes due in March 2006 and $42 million of our 6.125% notes due in April 2007 at a premium of $4 million. In addition, during 2005, we made scheduled debt repayments of $410 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During September 2005, we repurchased $190 million of the 7.75% senior subordinated notes assumed in the Premcor Acquisition. We also repurchased the 12.5% senior notes assumed in the Premcor Acquisition for $182 million in October 2005 and the Ohio Water Development Authority Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds for $10 million in November 2005. As of December 31, 2005, current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations included mainly $220 million of notes which become due in the first quarter of 2006. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. Following the completion of the Premcor Acquisition, Standard Poors Ratings Services affirmed its rating of our senior unsecured debt of BBB minus and recently changed our outlook from negative to stable while Moodys Investors Service affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook. In February 2006, Fitch Ratings upgraded its rating of our senior unsecured debt to BBB with a stable outlook. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply 39 Table of Contents arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2005, our short term and long term purchase obligations increased by approximately $19.1 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to purchase obligations arising from the Premcor Acquisition totaling approximately $13.0 billion and an increase in obligations under crude oil supply contracts resulting from significantly higher crude oil prices as of December 31, 2005 and new contracts in 2005. We have not made in the past, nor do we expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. Other Long term Liabilities Our other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2005. However, certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2006 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2005, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration 5 year revolving credit facility $2.5 billion August 2010 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2010 As of December 31, 2005, we had $232 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $8 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility and $254 million of letters of credit outstanding under our 5 year committed revolving credit facility. All of these letters of credit expire during 2006. Under our revolving bank credit facilitys definitions, our debt to capitalization ratio (net of cash) was 24.8% as of December 31, 2005 compared to 30.7% as of December 31, 2004. Equity On September 1, 2005, we issued 85 million shares of common stock as partial consideration for the Premcor Acquisition. The common stock issued was recorded at a price of $37.41 per share, representing the average price of our common stock from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Premcor Acquisition in April 2005, resulting in an aggregate recorded amount of $3.2 billion for the common stock issued. In addition, we issued stock options with a fair value of $595 million. We purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions to meet our obligations under employee benefit plans. We also purchase shares of our common stock from our employees and non employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During 2005, we expended $571 million for the purchase of 13 million shares of our common stock under these programs. Through February 24, 2006, we have purchased in the open market an additional 40 Table of Contents 3.7 million common shares at a cost of $199 million. No shares were purchased during 2005 or through February 24, 2006 under our $400 million stock repurchase program that was publicly announced on December 3, 2001. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2005, we contributed $61 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.5% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2005, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans were equal to approximately 76% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2005. However, the qualified pension plans were more than 90% funded based on their current liability, which is a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations. Although our expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2006 is less than $5 million under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to contribute approximately $65 million to our qualified pension plans during 2006, including the former Premcor qualified pension plans discussed below. During January 2006, we contributed $15 million to our qualified pension plans. In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we became the plan sponsor for two additional qualified pension plans. Prior to September 1, 2005, Premcor had contributed $20 million to these plans during 2005; we made no further contributions to these plans in 2005. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding our environmental matters, see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other During the third quarter of 2005, certain of our refineries experienced business interruption losses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of these losses, we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. No amounts related to these potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. Under an existing shelf registration statement that was declared effective by the SEC in August 2004, we have $3.5 billion of securities registered for potential future issuance. However, there can be no assurances 41 Table of Contents regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. As of June 30, 2005, we owned 45.5% of the outstanding units (including the 2% general partner interest) of Valero L.P., a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product pipeline, terminalling and storage tank assets. On July 1, 2005, our ownership interest decreased to 23.4% as a result of the completion of the Kaneb Acquisition by Valero L.P. Historically, Valero L.P. has issued common units to the public which have resulted in increases in our proportionate share of Valero L.P.s capital because the issuance price per unit exceeded our carrying amount per unit at the time of issuance. These increases in our investment in Valero L.P., however, have not been recognized in our consolidated financial statements through December 31, 2005 and we are not permitted to do so until Valero L.P.s subordinated units that we own convert to common units, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2006. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the amounts that will be recognized, either in income or directly as a credit to equity, upon the conversion of the subordinated units to common units. Subsequent to the conversion of the subordinated units, any credits or charges generated upon the issuance of new units to the public by Valero L.P. will be recognized immediately by us, either in income or directly in equity, depending on the accounting policy we adopt. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2005, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions was $1 billion. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2005, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, or is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, estimated remaining life of the asset, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. We recognized an impairment charge of $57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and an impairment charge of $26 million in 2003 related to our former headquarters buildings as discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own 43 Table of Contents internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2006 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 54 $ 16 Compensation rate increase 21 Health care cost trend rate increase 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 9 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 1 Compensation rate increase 5 Health care cost trend rate increase 1 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $3.8 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We also from time to time use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we use derivative commodity instruments that we mark to market for trading purposes based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges held to hedge refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments, cash flow hedges held to hedge forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, economic hedges held to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales and natural gas purchases, and trading activities held or issued for trading purposes. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The fair value for futures, swaps and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. 45 Table of Contents Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price.

We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged, and the recorded amount of the derivative instrument and long term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about our long term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. During May 2002, we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on an investment in our Canadian operations that we intended to redeem in the future. Under these contracts, we sold $400 million of Canadian dollars and bought $253 million of U.S. dollars. In February 2004, we redeemed our remaining balance of this investment in our Canadian operations. As a result, we liquidated the outstanding amount of these foreign currency exchange contracts for a net cash payment by us of approximately $34 million, with an immaterial effect on income in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the liquidation of these contracts. As of December 31, 2005, we had commitments to purchase $303 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 27, 2006. 49 Table of Contents
