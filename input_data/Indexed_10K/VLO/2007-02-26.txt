Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance. The principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (e.g., Californias AB 32 Global Warming Solutions Act), the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations. A significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela, Colombia, and Africa. We are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, those areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs. 12 Table of Contents Competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage. The refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. We compete with numerous other companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined products. We do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company owned production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. A significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business. Our refineries are our principal operating assets. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. If any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. Our operations expose us to many operating risks, not all of which are insured. Our refining and marketing operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and uncontrollable flows of oil and gas. They are also subject to the additional hazards of loss from severe weather conditions. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Certain of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. 13 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We hereby incorporate by reference into this Item the environmental disclosures contained in the following sections of this report: Item 1 under the caption Risk Factors Compliance with and changes in environmental laws could adversely affect our performance, Item 3 Legal Proceedings under the caption Environmental Enforcement Matters, and 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Items 1, 1A and 2, Business, Risk Factors and Properties, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per share amounts assume dilution. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading Results of Operations Outlook, includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, believe, expect, plan, intend, estimate, project, projection, predict, budget, forecast, goal, guidance, target, will, could, should, may, and similar expressions. These forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins; future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, and convenience store merchandise margins; expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses; anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations; anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere; expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. We based our forward looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; political and economic conditions in nations that consume refined products, including the United States, and in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, and petrochemicals; the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; 22 Table of Contents the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; environmental, tax, and other regulations at the municipal, state, and federal levels and in foreign countries; the level of foreign imports of refined products; accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, or equipment, or those of our suppliers or customers; changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles; delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks, and refined products; rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of federal, state, municipal, or foreign legislation or rulemakings, which may adversely affect our business or operations; changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit; changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 23 Table of Contents OVERVIEW The strong industry fundamentals we experienced throughout 2005 continued during 2006, resulting in the highest net income in our history of $5.5 billion, 52% higher than the net income reported in 2005. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. Refined product margins for the year 2006, both for gasoline and distillates, were comparable to the strong margins realized in 2005. Heavy industry wide turnaround activity, the implementation of more restrictive sulfur regulations on gasoline and diesel, increased use of ethanol and decreased use of MTBE in the reformulated gasoline pool, and limited capacity expansions due to the high cost of compliance with environmental regulations resulted in tighter supplies of refined products and strong margins during most of 2006. Since approximately 60% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil differential. Sour crude oil differentials for 2006 were also about as wide as the very favorable differentials experienced in 2005. In addition to these continuing strong industry fundamentals, we benefited significantly from the addition of the four former Premcor refineries, which generated $2.5 billion of operating income, or 31% of our total operating income of $8.0 billion, with average throughput volumes of 792,000 barrels per day during 2006. In addition to the operating income effects discussed above, we monetized our entire ownership interest in Valero L.P. by selling all of our units in Valero GP Holdings, LLC during 2006, generating proceeds of $880 million and recognizing a pre tax gain of $328 million. This sale, along with our favorable operating results, resulted in a strong balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. We reduced debt by $245 million during 2006 and increased our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year end, while at the same time purchasing $2.0 billion, or approximately 5%, of our outstanding shares.

(a) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the effect of a $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (b) As described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, amounts previously reported in 2005 for refining operating expenses, retail selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense, as well as related segment and regional amounts, have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2006. (c) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January 1, 2006, we adopted EITF Issue No. 04 13 which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (e) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (f) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis, and Lima Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (g) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2006 include 287,000, 304,000, and 201,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions. 28 Table of Contents (h) The information presented for the Mid Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the operations of the Denver Refinery, which was sold on May 31, 2005 to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 15,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former Premcor refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income increased $2.6 billion, or 47%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment and a $28 million increase in the retail segment, partially offset by a $47 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from a 19% increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of $1.15 per barrel, or 10%, partially offset by increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $1.2 billion. In addition, the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a $621 million pre tax LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting policy. The change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors: Throughput volumes increased 472,000 barrels per day during 2006 compared to 2005 due to 545,000 barrels per day of incremental throughput from the four former Premcor refineries, offset to some extent by the sale of the Denver Refinery in 2005 and significant planned and unplanned downtime at several of our refineries in 2006. Overall, gasoline and distillate margins increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significantly improved margins in the first half of 2006 attributable to increased foreign and U.S. demand, limited capacity additions, major industry turnaround activity, and continuing outages from last seasons hurricanes. However, the 2006 increase in gasoline and distillate margins was somewhat diminished in the second half of 2006 due to excess refined product supply and the higher margins experienced in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks during 2006 were essentially unchanged from the strong differentials in 2005, and remained wide due to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. Throughput margin improved in 2006 due to the negative impact in 2005 of pre tax losses of approximately $525 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. 29 Table of Contents Margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke and sulfur were lower in 2006 due to an increase in the price of crude oil from 2005 to 2006. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 32% higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily to the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005. Excluding the effect of the Premcor Acquisition, operating expenses increased 5% due mainly to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and catalyst and chemicals, partially offset by reduced energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 42% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition, the implementation of new capital projects, and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This 18% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased in store sales in the U.S. system, partially offset by higher selling expenses due mainly to an increase in credit card processing fees. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, stock based compensation expense, environmental expenses, and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a California excise tax dispute in 2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a pre tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC in 2006, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $1.0 billion from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased from the year ended December 31, 2005 as a lower percentage of our pre tax income was contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both Texas and Canada in 2006. 30 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Financial Highlights

(a) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the effect of a $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (b) As described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, amounts previously reported in 2005 and 2004 for refining operating expenses, retail selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense, as well as related segment and regional amounts, have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2006. (c) Includes the operations related to the Aruba Acquisition commencing on March 5, 2004. (d) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 and approximately $4.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January 1, 2006, we adopted EITF Issue No. 04 13 which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) Total throughput volumes and throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast region for the year ended December 31, 2004 are based on 366 days, which results in 183,000 barrels per day being included for the Aruba Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2004. Throughput volumes for the Aruba Refinery for the 302 days of its operations during 2004 averaged 221,000 barrels per day. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, Memphis, and Lima 34 Table of Contents Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 106,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 317,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions. (j) The information presented for the Mid Continent region includes the operations of the Denver Refinery through May 31, 2005, the date of our sale of this facility to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid Continent region include 15,000 and 37,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (k) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (l) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 50% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of significantly higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from refinery operations. Operating income and net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 83%, from 2004 to 2005 due primarily to a $2.6 billion increase in the refining segment, partially offset by a $30 million decrease in the retail segment and a $123 million increase in general and administrative expenses (including corporate depreciation and amortization expense). Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, resulting mainly from an increase in refining throughput margin of $3.70 per barrel, or 50%, and a 15% increase in throughput volumes, partially offset by an increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $977 million and the 2005 LIFO charge discussed in the 2006 Compared to 2005 Results of Operations. Refining throughput margin for 2005 increased primarily due to the following factors: Distillate margins increased significantly in all of our refining regions during 2005 compared to 2004, with margins in the Gulf Coast region almost triple the margins in 2004 and margins in the Mid Continent and Northeast regions more than double 2004 margins. The improvement in distillate margins was due to increased foreign and U.S. demand, resulting from improved U.S. and global economies and higher demand for on road diesel and jet fuel. In addition, both gasoline and distillate margins increased significantly in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which reduced the supply of refined products as refineries along the Gulf Coast reduced or shut down their operations because of the hurricanes. Differentials on our sour crude oil feedstocks improved during 2005 compared to 2004 due to ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. In addition, differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks benefited from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from several factors, including (i) the global movement to cleaner fuels, which has required most refineries to lower the sulfur content of the gasoline they produce, and (ii) a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which has resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. 35 Table of Contents Throughput volumes increased 326,000 barrels per day in 2005 compared to 2004 due mainly to throughput of 247,000 barrels per day at the four refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005, incremental throughput of 40,000 barrels per day at the Aruba Refinery, which was acquired in March 2004, and lower volumes in 2004 due to turnarounds at the St. Charles, Benicia, and Wilmington Refineries. The above increases in throughput margin for 2005 were partially offset by the effects of: lower margins on other refined products such as petroleum coke, sulfur, No. 6 fuel oil, asphalt, and propylene due to a significant increase in the price of crude oil from 2004 to 2005, and increased pre tax losses of approximately $295 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 37% higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due mainly to $420 million of expenses related to the refineries acquired in the Premcor Acquisition, a full year of operations of the Aruba Refinery, and increases in energy costs, employee compensation expense, and maintenance expense. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 39% from 2004 to 2005 due mainly to depreciation expense resulting from the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005, implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, a $15 million gain in 2004 on the sale of certain property discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the write off of costs in 2005 resulting from the decision to convert wholesale sites marketing under the Diamond Shamrock brand to the Valero brand. Retail Retail operating income was $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of 16% between the periods. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses in the U.S. and Canada as higher retail fuel prices resulted in higher credit card processing fees. In addition, Canadas selling expenses increased $15 million due to an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $123 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, the recognition of increased variable compensation expense, resulting in large part from a significant increase in our common stock price during 2005, and expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. These increases were partially offset by the successful resolution in the first quarter of 2005 of a California excise tax dispute. Other income (expense), net improved $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the combined effect of a $55 million gain realized on the sale of our equity interests in Javelina Company and Javelina Pipeline Company in November 2005 and a 2004 impairment charge of $57 million to write off the carrying amount of our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. This combined effect, as well as an increase in bank interest income due to higher cash balances, was partially offset by our 50% interest in certain debt refinancing costs incurred in 2005 by the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture and increased costs related to our accounts receivable sales program. 36 Table of Contents Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2004 to 2005 due to interest incurred in 2005 on the debt resulting from the Premcor Acquisition. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the four former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $791 million from 2004 to 2005 mainly as a result of a 95% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005, however, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of a change in permanent book to tax differences, which included a deduction from income in 2005 for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, as allowed under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. OUTLOOK In January 2007, we saw industry fundamentals for refined products remain consistent with what we experienced at the end of 2006. The Gulf Coast gasoline margin for January 2007 was $4.62 per barrel, while the West Coast gasoline margin averaged $20.34 per barrel. Regarding distillates, the Gulf Coast on road diesel margin was $13.00 per barrel and the West Coast on road diesel margin was $28.94 per barrel. Our outlook for gasoline margins is positive. Gasoline supplies are expected to tighten as spring maintenance activity gets underway. In addition, the industry will soon be making the transition from winter grade gasoline specifications to summer grade specifications, which generally leads to declines in inventories and higher margins as we head toward the summer driving season. While these factors are expected to reduce supplies, gasoline demand is expected to remain positive this year as a result of lower pump prices and a continuing strong economy. This positive demand trend combined with the expected pressure on supplies should create a tightening of the supply/demand balance. The outlook for low sulfur distillate margins is also favorable as on road diesel demand continues to be strong. Currently, approximately 80% of our U.S. on road distillate production is ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and we are on schedule to meet the EPAs phase in requirements for ULSD by the end of the transition period in June 2007. In addition, specifications requiring a reduction in the amount of sulfur in off road diesel (excluding marine and railroad uses) go into effect in June of this year, which may further tighten supplies. As a result, we expect the favorable spread between on road and off road diesel prices to continue. Sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable for the foreseeable future. Persistently weak residual fuel oil prices support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil purchases if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil. In addition, the flexibility of many of our refineries to process alternative sour crude oils allows us to continue to find attractively priced feedstocks. Operationally during 2007, we expect to benefit from our recently completed Port Arthur crude unit expansion which allows us to process up to 325,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil at that refinery. On February 16, 2007, our McKee Refinery experienced a fire in its propane deasphalting unit. As of the filing of this annual report, the entire McKee Refinery remains shut down while efforts are underway to determine the cause of the accident, assess damages, and establish a plan for making repairs. Full scale efforts to assess damages, make repairs, and restart the refinery are underway though we do not yet have a firm estimated date for commencement of operations. Although we are in the preliminary stages of assessing the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the first quarter of 2007. 37 Table of Contents Overall, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected continuing positive industry fundamentals during 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.3 billion compared to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a $1.0 billion increase in current income tax expense. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to the factors discussed below in Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to price increases for gasoline and crude oil. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006, combined with $880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC, a $206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation cost, and $122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: fund $3.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; purchase 34.6 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $2.0 billion; make long term note repayments of $249 million; fund $101 million of contingent earn out payments in connection with the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., the St. Charles Refinery, and the Delaware City Refinery; terminate our interest rate swap contracts for $54 million; pay common and preferred stock dividends of $184 million; and increase available cash on hand by $1.2 billion. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.9 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $2.9 billion. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations and an $879 million increase from favorable working capital changes between the years, as reflected in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, working capital was positively impacted by a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased significantly due to commodity price increases from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The net cash generated from operating activities during 2005, combined with $428 million of available cash on hand, $182 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, $78 million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in the Javelina joint venture, $45 million of proceeds from the sale of the Denver Refinery, and a $38 million net return of investment from the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture resulting mainly from the refinancing of the joint ventures debt in June 2005, were used mainly to: fund $2.6 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; make long term note repayments of $874 million; 38 Table of Contents fund $2.3 billion of the Premcor Acquisition, net of cash acquired; purchase 13 million shares of treasury stock at a cost of $571 million; fund contingent earn out payments of $85 million in connection with prior acquisitions; fund certain minor acquisitions for $62 million; make a general partner contribution to Valero L.P. of $29 million; and pay common and preferred stock dividends of $106 million. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2006, we expended $3.2 billion for capital expenditures and $569 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $1.6 billion of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, we expended $101 million for amounts due under contingent earn out agreements. In connection with our acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in any of the ten years and seven years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcors obligation under a contingent earn out agreement related to Premcors acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva). Under this agreement, Motiva was entitled to receive two separate annual earn out contingency payments depending on (a) the amount of crude oil processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May 2007, and (b) the achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through May 2006. The earn out contingency related to the gasification facility expired in 2006 with no payment required. Payments due under all of these earn out arrangements are limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2006, we made earn out payments of $26 million (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery. In January 2007, we made an earn out payment of $50 million related to the St. Charles Refinery. Based on estimated margin levels through April 2007, earn out payments of $25 million (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under the agreement) related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery would be due in the second quarter of 2007. For 2007, we expect to incur approximately $3.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $3.1 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $800 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to the contingent earn out agreements discussed above and strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 462 $ 6 $ 209 $ 33 $ 418 $ 3,946 $ 5,074 Capital lease obligations 9 10 10 10 9 84 132 Operating lease obligations 413 331 243 161 100 238 1,486 Purchase obligations 19,955 7,090 1,657 311 302 2,333 31,648 Other long term liabilities 183 155 153 145 986 1,622 Total $ 20,839 $ 7,620 $ 2,274 $ 668 $ 974 $ 7,587 $ 39,962 39 Table of Contents Long Term Debt Payments for long term debt are at stated values. During March 2006, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $220 million related to our 7.375% notes. In addition, during 2006, we made debt payments of $29 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2006, current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included mainly $230 million of notes which become due in April 2007 and $50 million of notes which become due in November 2007, as well as $175 million of notes with a maturity date of February 2010 which were redeemed in February 2007, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2006, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard & Poors Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moodys Investors Service Baa3 (stable outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock, and storage to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2006, our short term and long term purchase obligations decreased by approximately $2.0 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2005. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in obligations under crude oil supply contracts, partially offset by new contracts in 2006. We have not made in the past, nor do we expect to make in the future, payments for feedstock or services that we have not received or will not receive, nor paid prices in excess of then prevailing market conditions. 40 Table of Contents Other Long term Liabilities Our other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For most of these liabilities, the timing of the payment of such liabilities is not fixed and therefore cannot be determined as of December 31, 2006. However, certain expected payments related to our anticipated pension contribution in 2007 and our other postretirement benefit obligations are discussed in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2006. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2006, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Revolving credit facility $ 2.5 billion August 2011 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $ 115 million December 2010 As of December 31, 2006, we had $343 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, Cdn. $85 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility, and $245 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2007, 2008, and 2009. Stock Purchase Programs Our board of directors has approved our purchase of treasury stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements as well as purchases under our publicly announced stock purchase programs. Under these authorizations, we purchased approximately 5% of our outstanding shares during 2006. We purchased 28.9 million shares for $1.6 billion related to our employee benefit plans and 5.7 million shares for $361 million under our former stock purchase program. On October 19, 2006, our board of directors approved a new $2 billion common stock purchase program. This new authorization is in addition to our existing authorization for employee benefit plan requirements. Stock purchases under this program will be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and are subject to market conditions and other factors. The program does not have a scheduled expiration date. During 2006, we purchased no shares under our new $2 billion stock purchase program. Sale of Investment in Valero GP Holdings, LLC On July 19, 2006, Valero GP Holdings, LLC consummated an initial public offering (IPO) of 17,250,000 of its units representing limited liability company interests to the public at $22.00 per unit, before an underwriters discount of $1.265 per unit. On December 22, 2006, Valero GP Holdings, LLC completed a secondary public offering of 20,550,000 units representing limited liability company interests at a price of $21.62 per unit, before an underwriters discount of $0.8648 per unit. In addition, 4,700,000 unregistered units of Valero GP Holdings, LLC were sold to its chairman of the board of directors (who was at that time also chairman of Valeros board of directors) at $21.62 per unit. All such units were sold by our subsidiaries that held various ownership interests in Valero GP Holdings, LLC. As a result, Valero GP Holdings, LLC did not receive any proceeds from these offerings, and our indirect ownership interest in Valero GP Holdings, LLC was reduced to zero. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the IPO totaled approximately $355 million, net of the underwriters discount and other offering expenses, which resulted in a pre tax gain to us of $132 million on the sale of the units. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the secondary offering and private sale of units totaled 41 Table of Contents approximately $525 million, net of the underwriters discount and other offering expenses, which resulted in an additional pre tax gain to us of $196 million. The total pre tax gain of $328 million is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. The funds received from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2006, we contributed $343 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.75% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 104% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2006. Although we have no expected minimum required contribution to our qualified pension plans during 2007 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our qualified plans during 2007. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. For additional information regarding our environmental matters, see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax Matters We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. For example, effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010, we believe that sales by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. We have filed a request for arbitration with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under this tax holiday. Other During the third quarter of 2005, certain of our refineries experienced property damage and business interruption losses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of these losses, we submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. As of December 31, 2006, we have recorded a receivable related to our property damage claims, which was recorded as a reduction of repair and maintenance expense. No amounts related to the potential business interruption insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 as we had not reached a final settlement with the insurance carriers. During 2006, we reached a final business interruption settlement with our insurance carriers, the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. Amounts received or to be received for these matters are immaterial to our results of operations and financial position. On February 1, 2007, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives for our Lima Refinery, which we acquired in the Premcor Acquisition. 42 Table of Contents Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2006, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions was $1 billion. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2006, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, nor is expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. We recognized an impairment charge of $57 million in 2004 related to our equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. as discussed in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the 44 Table of Contents determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2007 (in millions): Pension Benefits Other Postretirement Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 59 $ 17 Compensation rate increase 23 Health care cost trend rate increase 11 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 9 2 Expected return on plan assets decrease 3 Compensation rate increase 5 Health care cost trend rate increase 2 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax 45 Table of Contents liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $7.1 billion as of both December 31, 2006 and 2005. From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. 46 Table of Contents The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future); cash flow hedges which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; economic hedges (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges) which are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income pending consummation of the forecasted transactions. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 Contract Volumes Wtd Avg Pay Price Wtd Avg Receive Price Contract Value Market Value Pre tax Fair Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 15,261 $ 63.66 N/A $ 972 $ 949 $ (23 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 22,091 N/A $ 64.56 1,426 1,379 47 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 70.14 65.16 N/A (195 ) (195 ) Swaps short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 69.66 76.30 N/A 260 260 Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 21,087 64.75 N/A 1,365 1,336 (29 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 18,356 N/A 64.82 1,190 1,161 29 Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 13,244 12.02 11.02 N/A (13 ) (13 ) 2007 (natural gas) 893 0.76 0.78 N/A Swaps short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 7,605 26.47 27.66 N/A 9 9 2007 (natural gas) 833 0.85 0.89 N/A Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 50,442 64.28 N/A 3,242 3,171 (71 ) 2007 (natural gas) 400 7.33 N/A 3 3 Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 51,623 N/A 64.15 3,312 3,252 60 2007 (natural gas) 400 N/A 8.21 3 3 Options long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 31 84.29 N/A Options short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 1,478 N/A 61.94 (6 ) 6 Trading Activities: Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 77.29 N/A 62 59 (3 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 N/A 84.87 68 58 10 Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ 87 48 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 50,912 $ 59.03 N/A $ 3,005 $ 3,113 $ 108 Futures short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 64,422 N/A $ 59.87 3,857 3,958 (101 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Futures long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 18,179 62.24 N/A 1,131 1,152 21 Futures short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 13,690 N/A 60.51 828 849 (21 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 7,947 8.12 8.81 N/A 5 5 2006 (natural gas) 2,700 11.37 9.19 N/A (6 ) (6 ) Swaps short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 4,481 17.27 16.85 N/A (2 ) (2 ) 2006 (natural gas) 1,350 9.19 11.46 N/A 3 3 Futures long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 29,945 65.64 N/A 1,966 2,036 70 Futures short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 27,052 N/A 65.34 1,768 1,815 (47 ) Options long: 2006 (natural gas) 1,290 9.27 N/A (2 ) (1 ) 1 Options short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 190 N/A 72.95 (1 ) (1 ) 2006 (natural gas) 690 N/A 7.98 Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 300 11.64 11.94 N/A 2006 (natural gas) 350 9.33 11.28 N/A 1 1 Swaps short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 1,350 12.66 13.17 N/A 1 1 2006 (natural gas) 350 11.28 9.18 N/A (1 ) (1 ) Futures long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 12,266 60.01 N/A 736 763 27 2006 (natural gas) 840 8.03 N/A 6 9 3 Futures short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 10,816 N/A 60.49 654 678 (24 ) 2006 (natural gas) 840 N/A 8.34 7 9 (2 ) Options long: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 2,000 0.50 N/A 2006 (natural gas) 900 10.00 N/A Options short: 2006 (crude oil and refined products) 2,000 N/A 0.50 2006 (natural gas) 900 N/A 10.00 Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ 36 49 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK Our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged is recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and long term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. The following table provides information about our long term debt and interest rate derivative instruments (dollars in millions), all of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long term debt, principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average floating rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date.

Substantially all of this payment was deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments that were being hedged. 50 Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2006, we had commitments to purchase $290 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 19, 2007, resulting in a 2007 gain of $4 million. 51 Table of Contents
