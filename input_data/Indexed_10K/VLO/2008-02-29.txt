ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following review of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with Items 1, 1A and 2, Business, Risk Factors and Properties, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included in this report. In the discussions that follow, all per share amounts assume dilution. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report, including without limitation our disclosures below under the heading Results of Operations Outlook, includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify our forward looking statements by the words anticipate, believe, expect, plan, intend, estimate, project, projection, predict, budget, forecast, goal, guidance, target, could, should, may, and similar expressions. These forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding: future refining margins, including gasoline and distillate margins; future retail margins, including gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, and convenience store merchandise margins; expectations regarding feedstock costs, including crude oil differentials, and operating expenses; anticipated levels of crude oil and refined product inventories; our anticipated level of capital investments, including deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs and capital expenditures for environmental and other purposes, and the effect of those capital investments on our results of operations; anticipated trends in the supply of and demand for crude oil and other feedstocks and refined products in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere; expectations regarding environmental, tax, and other regulatory initiatives; and the effect of general economic and other conditions on refining and retail industry fundamentals. We based our forward looking statements on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about ourselves and our industry. We caution that these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; political and economic conditions in nations that consume refined products, including the United States, and in crude oil producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; the domestic and foreign supplies of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, and petrochemicals; the domestic and foreign supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; 21 Table of Contents the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and the expansion and retirement of refining capacity in response to market conditions; environmental, tax, and other regulations at the municipal, state, and federal levels and in foreign countries; the level of foreign imports of refined products; accidents or other unscheduled shutdowns affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, or equipment, or those of our suppliers or customers; changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles; delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil and other feedstocks, and refined products; rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of federal, state, municipal, or foreign legislation or rulemakings, which may adversely affect our business or operations; changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit; changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar; and overall economic conditions. Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. All subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any such forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 22 Table of Contents OVERVIEW In this overview, we discuss the major transactions of our business during the year ended December 31, 2007 and describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of operations during the year. Although we reported strong earnings from continuing operations for 2007, they decreased from comparable earnings reported in 2006. We reported income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $7.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $5.3 billion, or $8.36 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. Gasoline and distillate margins in 2007 improved compared to such margins in 2006 primarily due to supply limitations caused by industry wide refinery downtime, both planned and unplanned, lower imports into the United States, and tighter product specifications. However, rapidly rising crude oil prices resulted in lower margins for certain of our secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur, the prices of which did not increase nearly as much as the cost of the feedstocks used to produce them. In addition, our contribution to earnings resulting from processing sour crude oil rather than sweet crude oil at many of our refineries decreased compared to 2006. Since more than 60% of our total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil differential. Sour crude oil differentials relative to WTI crude oil for 2007, although good, decreased compared to the strong differentials in 2006. The fourth quarter of 2007 demonstrated the advantages of our complex and geographically diverse refining system. While refined product margins were reduced due to a significant increase in feedstock costs relative to product prices, our complex refineries were able to mitigate this unfavorable effect by benefiting from wide sour crude oil differentials. In addition, while product margins in the West Coast region were low, we were able to compensate somewhat for the effect of the low West Coast margins with earnings in the other geographic regions in which we operate. On February 16, 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, which reduced operating income by approximately $325 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The refinery recommenced operations in April at a reduced throughput rate, with run rates increasing to near full capacity by the end of the third quarter of 2007. All repairs have now been completed and the refinery is running at normal capacity as of February 2008. Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our refinery in Lima, Ohio to Husky Refining Company (Husky), a wholly owned subsidiary of Husky Energy Inc. The sales price was approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $550 million from the sale of working capital to Husky, primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $827 million. During 2007, we also recognized a pre tax gain of $91 million related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. In the second quarter of 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program under which we purchased 42.1 million shares of our common stock, which was subsequently funded mainly with proceeds from our issuance of $2.25 billion of new debt during 2007. During 2007, we continued our ongoing effort to increase shareholder value by using a balanced approach to allocating our cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we generated $5.3 billion of net cash from operating activities, using portions of that cash to increase our 2007 common stock dividends from $0.08 per share to $0.12 per share and to purchase 42.2 million shares of our common stock in addition to the 42.1 million shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above. During 2007, we repurchased 14% of our shares that were outstanding at the beginning of 2007. We also invested $2.8 billion of capital into our refining system and other assets. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 Compared to 2006 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 for operating revenues, cost of sales, retail selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2007. (c) On December 22, 2006, we sold our remaining ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (formerly Valero GP Holdings, LLC), which indirectly owned the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights, and a 21.4% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. (formerly Valero L.P.) As a result, the financial highlights reflect no equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. or minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC subsequent to December 21, 2006. (d) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (e) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (f) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (g) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (h) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. (i) The market reference differential for ultra low sulfur diesel was not available prior to May 1, 2006, and therefore no market reference differential is presented for the year ended December 31, 2006. 27 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. Operating income decreased $804 million, or 10%, and income from continuing operations decreased $722 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an $827 million decrease in refining segment operating income. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $631 million. In addition, total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by $196 million due to a $0.14 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.40 per barrel, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and energy costs, as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, and the write off of costs related to the McKee Refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in February 2007. Total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors: Overall, gasoline and distillate margins relative to WTI increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a decline in refined product inventory levels resulting from unplanned refinery outages, lower imports, more stringent product specifications and regulations, and heavy industry turnaround activity, as well as moderately stronger demand. Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2007 decreased from the strong differentials in 2006. However, other light, sweet crude oils priced at a premium to WTI in 2007; thus, sour crude oil feedstock differentials relative to those other light, sweet crude oils in 2007 were comparable to the wide differentials experienced in 2006. These wide differentials are attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand. Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur were lower in 2007 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. Throughput volumes decreased 13,000 barrels per day during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a reduction in throughput volumes at our McKee Refinery as a result of the fire discussed above. Retail Retail operating income was $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 37% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to 28 Table of Contents increased in store sales and improved retail fuel margins in our U.S. and Canadian retail operations, partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses, an increase in employee compensation and benefits, including incentive compensation, a $13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P., and increased charitable contributions, partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $91 million pre tax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these effects, other income, net increased $54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007. Interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes in June 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program (as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), increased interest on tax liabilities, and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction. Income tax expense decreased $450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pre tax income contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010, combined with favorable tax law changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, increased $493 million from the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2007 due primarily to a pre tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, on the sale of the Lima Refinery in July 2007 combined with a $67 million increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery between the two years. The increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery was mainly attributable to a 94% increase in the refinerys throughput margin per barrel, from $8.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $17.41 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2007, which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale. 29 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2006 (a) 2005 (a) (b) Change Operating

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September 1, 2005. Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December 31, 2005 include the effect of a $621 million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the information presented comparable between periods. (c) Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 and 2005 for operating revenues, cost of sales, retail selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for comparability with amounts reported in 2007. (d) Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January 1, 2006, we adopted EITF Issue No. 04 13 which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions. (e) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (f) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (g) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (h) Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended December 31, 2006 include 287,000, 155,000, and 201,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended 33 Table of Contents December 31, 2005 include 78,000, 53,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor commencing on September 1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for the 122 days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September 1, 2005 were 234,000, 157,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, and Northeast regions. (i) The information presented for the Mid Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the operations of the Denver Refinery, which was sold on May 31, 2005 to Suncor Energy (U.S.A.) Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid Continent region for the year ended December 31, 2005 include 15,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery. (j) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (k) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional throughput volumes from the former Premcor refinery operations. Operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased significantly compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 47%, from 2005 to 2006 due to a $2.5 billion increase in the refining segment. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from a 15% increase in throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of $1.37 per barrel, or 12%, partially offset by increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $1.1 billion. In addition, the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a $621 million pre tax LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting policy. The change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following factors: Throughput volumes increased 376,000 barrels per day during 2006 compared to 2005 due to 449,000 barrels per day of incremental throughput from the three former Premcor refineries, offset to some extent by the sale of the Denver Refinery in 2005 and significant planned and unplanned downtime at several of our refineries in 2006. Overall, gasoline and distillate margins increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significantly improved margins in the first half of 2006 attributable to increased foreign and U.S. demand, limited capacity additions, major industry turnaround activity, and continuing outages from the 2005 hurricanes. However, the 2006 increase in gasoline and distillate margins was somewhat diminished in the second half of 2006 due to excess refined product supply and the higher margins experienced in September and October of 2005 due to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks during 2006 were essentially unchanged from the strong differentials in 2005, and remained wide due to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for 34 Table of Contents gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as feedstock. Throughput margin improved in 2006 due to the negative impact in 2005 of pre tax losses of approximately $525 million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. Margins on secondary refined products such as petroleum coke and sulfur were lower in 2006 due to an increase in the price of crude oil from 2005 to 2006. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 29% higher for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition on September 1, 2005. Excluding the effect of the Premcor Acquisition, operating expenses increased 5% due mainly to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and catalyst and chemicals, partially offset by reduced energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 38% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition, the implementation of new capital projects, and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This 18% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased in store sales in the U.S. system. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, stock based compensation expense, environmental expenses, and charitable contributions as well as the favorable resolution of a California excise tax dispute in 2005. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition, partially offset by a reduction in other debt outstanding. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital projects, including projects at the three former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $990 million from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55% increase in income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased from the year ended December 31, 2005 as a lower percentage of our pre tax income was contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the effects of new tax legislation in both Texas and Canada in 2006. 35 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Based on current forward market indicators, our outlook for refined product margins for the remainder of 2008 is positive. With respect to the gasoline market, winter grade gasoline inventories increased in late 2007 and early 2008 in anticipation of the normal cycle of industry wide plant maintenance that occurs in the first quarter. As spring maintenance activities occur, refined product supplies are expected to decline. In addition, the industry will soon be making the transition from winter grade gasoline to summer grade gasoline, which is more difficult and costly to produce due to more stringent specifications and thus generally contributes to a decline in inventories. Furthermore, we expect strong diesel margins to continue and provide an incentive to refiners to maximize diesel production, thereby further limiting gasoline supplies. These anticipated supply constraints, combined with a typical seasonal increase in demand, are expected to result in higher gasoline margins as the summer driving season approaches. Our outlook for on road diesel margins is also favorable as on road diesel demand continues to be good and on road diesel inventory levels in 2008 are below 2007 levels on a days of supply basis. As a result, we expect on road diesel margins to remain strong. In regard to feedstocks, sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable during 2008. Residual fuel oil prices have not increased as much as crude oil prices, which should support wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for a portion of their sour crude oil requirements if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to process than crude oil. In addition, new supplies of medium sour crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico in 2008 should contribute to continuing wide sour crude oil differentials. On January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery experienced a fire in its vacuum unit. We are in the process of making the necessary repairs and we resumed partial operation of the refinery in mid February. We expect to resume full operations in the second quarter of 2008. Although we have not completed our assessment of the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2008. Regarding other operations for 2008, we began scheduled maintenance on our coker drums at our Port Arthur Refinery in the first quarter that will reduce throughput volumes in the Gulf Coast region for about three months beginning in early February. Otherwise, our turnaround schedule for 2008 is relatively light, which should benefit our results of operations during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $5.3 billion compared to $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations and a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility, as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006. Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $260 million and 36 Table of Contents $215 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $14 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007, combined with $2.2 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long term notes, $2.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Lima Refinery, a $311 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation cost, and $159 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; purchase 84.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.8 billion; make an early long term note redemption of $183 million and scheduled long term note repayments of $280 million; fund capital contributions, net of distributions, of $209 million to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project mainly to enable the joint venture to redeem all of its outstanding debt; fund contingent earn out payments in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the Delaware City Refinery of $50 million and $25 million, respectively; pay common stock dividends of $271 million; and increase available cash on hand by $874 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.3 billion compared to $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the significant increase in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations, partially offset by a $1.2 billion decrease from an unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a $1.0 billion increase in current income tax expense. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable working capital change in 2005 attributable to a $400 million increase in the amount of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately $200 million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to higher prices for gasoline and crude oil at December 31, 2006 compared to such prices at the end of 2005. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $215 million and $121 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $133 million and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006, combined with $880 million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, a $206 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation cost, and $122 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: fund $3.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; purchase 34.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.0 billion; make long term note repayments of $249 million; fund $101 million of contingent earn out payments in connection with the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., the St. Charles Refinery, and the Delaware City Refinery; terminate our interest rate swap contracts for $54 million; 37 Table of Contents pay common and preferred stock dividends of $184 million; and increase available cash on hand by $1.2 billion. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2007, we expended $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $518 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $614 million of costs related to environmental projects. In addition, we expended $75 million for amounts due under contingent earn out agreements. In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level (see the discussion in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we assumed Premcors obligation under a contingent earn out agreement related to Premcors acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC. Payments due under these earn out arrangements were limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2007, we made earn out payments of $50 million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and $25 million related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery (the maximum remaining payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement). In January 2008, we made a $25 million earn out payment related to the St. Charles Refinery, which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement. For 2008, we expect to incur approximately $4.5 billion for capital investments, including approximately $4.1 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $575 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $400 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In May and June of 2007, we made cash capital contributions of $190 million and $25 million, respectively, to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, representing our 50% portion of the amount required for the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture to redeem its fixed rate notes and variable rate debt, respectively. Our capital contributions, along with equal capital contributions from the other 50% joint venture partner, were used to redeem all of the joint ventures outstanding debt. Lima Refinery Disposition Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $550 million from the sale of working capital to Husky, primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, which is presented in income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with Husky under which we agreed to provide certain accounting and administrative services to Husky, with the services terminating by July 31, 2008. A significant portion of these services has been transitioned to Husky as of February 27, 2008. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Long term debt and capital lease obligations $ 362 $ 215 $ 39 $ 424 $ 765 $ 5,114 $ 6,919 Operating lease obligations 384 282 188 110 54 190 1,208 Purchase obligations 27,378 7,056 858 707 540 2,113 38,652 Other long term liabilities 197 185 177 176 1,075 1,810 Total $ 28,124 $ 7,750 $ 1,270 $ 1,418 $ 1,535 $ 8,492 $ 48,589 Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Payments for long term debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments, respectively. During February 2007, we redeemed our 9.25% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2010 for $183 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we made scheduled debt repayments of $280 million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2007, we borrowed $3 billion under a 364 day term credit agreement with a financial institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2007, we repaid $500 million of the borrowings under the 364 day term credit agreement. The remaining balance of $2.5 billion was repaid in June 2007 using available cash and proceeds from the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2007, current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of our 9.5% senior notes with a stated value of $350 million and a maturity date of February 2013, which were redeemed in February 2008 as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2007, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard Poors Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moodys Investors Service Baa3 (positive outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in other long term liabilities. 39 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2007, our short term and long term purchase obligations increased by $7.0 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006. Other Long term Liabilities Our other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2007. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2007, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Revolving credit facility $2.5 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 As of December 31, 2007, we had $502 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, $292 million of letters of credit outstanding under our committed revolving credit facility, and Cdn. $11 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2008 and 2009. Stock Purchase Programs During the first quarter of 2007, we had two stock purchase programs that had been previously approved by our board of directors. One program authorized our purchase of our common stock in open market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements and the other was a $2 billion common stock purchase program. Stock purchases under the programs are made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, subject to market conditions and other factors. The programs do not have a scheduled expiration date. On April 25, 2007, our board of directors approved an amendment to our $2 billion common stock purchase program to increase the authorized purchases under the program to $6 billion. In conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase $3 billion of our shares under an accelerated share repurchase program, and in late April 2007, 42.1 million shares were purchased under this agreement. The purchase of these shares was funded with a short term bridge loan, which we subsequently replaced with longer term financing as described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The cost of the shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program was to be adjusted, with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading price of our 40 Table of Contents common stock, weighted by the daily volume of shares traded, during the program period. Any adjustment to the cost could be paid in cash or stock, at our option. The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on July 23, 2007, and we elected to pay in cash an additional $94 million for the shares purchased. This cash payment had a dilutive effect on our computation of earnings per common share from continuing operations assuming dilution for the year ended December 31, 2007 (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007, we purchased 70.5 million shares of our common stock for $4.9 billion under our $6 billion common stock purchase program, including shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above, and 13.8 million shares for $915 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans. These purchases represented approximately 14% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2006. During 2008 (through February 22), we have purchased 4.9 million shares of our common stock for $317 million under our two stock purchase programs. On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a new $3 billion stock purchase program. This program is in addition to the $6 billion program discussed above. This new $3 billion program has no expiration date. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2007, we contributed $143 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 6.00% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2007, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 120% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2007. Although we have only $2 million of minimum required contributions to our qualified pension plans during 2008 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to use expected available cash to contribute approximately $100 million to our qualified plans during 2008. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. No amounts have been accrued on exports with respect to this turnover tax. We have commenced arbitration 41 Table of Contents proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under the tax holiday. We have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. Other During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we have submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we received an immaterial initial payment from the insurance carriers on our claims, the proceeds from which were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. No additional amount has been accrued related to these claims pending future settlements with the insurance carriers. In November 2007, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our Aruba Refinery. In January 2008, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our Memphis and Krotz Springs Refineries. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December 31, 2007, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August 2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third party financial institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our sale of receivables under the program. During the third quarter of 2007, we reduced the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions by $900 million. Therefore, as of December 31, 2007, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party financial institutions was $100 million. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December 31, 2007, the termination of this program would not have had a material effect on our liquidity, particularly considering the reduction in the utilization of the program during 2007 as discussed above, and would not have affected our ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. 42 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, 43 Table of Contents additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is included in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2008 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 56 $ 15 Compensation rate increase 23 Health care cost trend rate increase 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 7 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 3 Compensation rate increase 5 Health care cost trend rate increase 1 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad 44 Table of Contents valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). The carrying amount of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $3.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $10.1 billion and $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of 45 Table of Contents market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy which has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: fair value hedges, which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future); cash flow hedges, which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; economic hedges (hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges), which are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income pending consummation of the forecasted transactions. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 46 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 68,873 $ 97.69 N/A $ 6,728 $ 6,961 $ 233 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 79,188 N/A $ 96.89 7,673 8,005 (332 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 81.44 98.50 N/A 310 310 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 102.55 86.25 N/A (296 ) (296 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 80,960 103.50 N/A 8,379 8,596 217 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 73,735 N/A 103.62 7,640 7,826 (186 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 12,012 33.16 39.48 N/A 76 76 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 7,397 63.91 54.25 N/A (71 ) (71 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 77,902 96.20 N/A 7,494 7,802 308 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 76,426 N/A 96.18 7,351 7,663 (312 ) Options long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 89 47.72 N/A 1 1 Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 14,677 11.77 12.98 N/A 18 18 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 15,952 12.47 11.56 N/A (15 ) (15 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,801 98.01 N/A 2,823 2,923 100 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,766 N/A 98.20 2,824 2,920 (96 ) Options short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 66 N/A 49.00 1 1 Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ (45 ) 47 Table of Contents December 31, 2006 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 15,261 $ 63.66 N/A $ 972 $ 949 $ (23 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 22,091 N/A $ 64.56 1,426 1,379 47 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 70.14 65.16 N/A (195 ) (195 ) Swaps short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 39,125 69.66 76.30 N/A 260 260 Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 21,087 64.75 N/A 1,365 1,336 (29 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 18,356 N/A 64.82 1,190 1,161 29 Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 13,244 12.02 11.02 N/A (13 ) (13 ) 2007 (natural gas) 893 0.76 0.78 N/A Swaps short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 7,605 26.47 27.66 N/A 9 9 2007 (natural gas) 833 0.85 0.89 N/A Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 50,442 64.28 N/A 3,242 3,171 (71 ) 2007 (natural gas) 400 7.33 N/A 3 3 Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 51,623 N/A 64.15 3,312 3,252 60 2007 (natural gas) 400 N/A 8.21 3 3 Options long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 31 84.29 N/A Options short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 1,478 N/A 61.94 (6 ) 6 Trading Activities: Futures long: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 77.29 N/A 62 59 (3 ) Futures short: 2007 (crude oil and refined products) 801 N/A 84.87 68 58 10 Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ 87 48 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and long term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The following table provides information about our long term debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. December 31, 2007 Expected Maturity Dates There Fair 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 after Total Value Long term Debt: Fixed rate $ 356 $ 209 $ 33 $ 418 $ 759 $ 5,086 $ 6,861 $ 7,109 Average interest rate 9.4 % 3.6 % 6.8 % 6.4 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 6.8 % December 31, 2006 Expected Maturity Dates There Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 after Total Value Long term Debt: Fixed rate $ 462 $ 6 $ 209 $ 33 $ 418 $ 3,946 $ 5,074 $ 5,361 Average interest rate 7.3 % 6.0 % 3.6 % 6.8 % 6.4 % 7.1 % 6.9 % FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2007, we had commitments to purchase $507 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 29, 2008, resulting in a 2008 loss of $2 million. 49 Table of Contents
