We reported a loss from continuing operations of $1.1 billion, or $2.16 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $7.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 results included a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $4.1 billion ($4.0 billion after tax) resulting from the impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment loss, which represented a write off of the entire balance of our goodwill, was associated with a significant decline in our market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2008 that resulted in large part from severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets. In performing our goodwill impairment test under applicable accounting rules, we estimate fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows from our refineries. The decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in the use of higher, risk adjusted discount rates in determining the fair values of our reporting units, which reflected the significant risk premium implied by our stock price as of December 31, 2008. As a result of applying these higher discount rates to the cash flows of our reporting units, the fair values in each of our reporting units were below their net book values including goodwill, thus indicating potential impairment. Due to this conclusion of potential impairment, existing accounting rules required additional analysis for each of the reporting units to determine the amount of the loss, and this additional analysis indicated that all of the goodwill in each of our reporting units should be written off. Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana to a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $305 million, or $170 million after tax, as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net cash proceeds from the sale were $463 million, including approximately $135 million from the sale of working capital. In addition, we received contingent consideration in the form of a three year earn out agreement based on certain product margins. Our profitability is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. The weakening of industry fundamentals for refined products that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007 continued throughout 2008. Gasoline margins declined significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. Margins on certain secondary refined products, such as petroleum coke and petrochemical feedstocks, also declined during 2008 due to a significant increase in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks used to produce them. However, these decreases were partially offset by the effect of favorable diesel margins in 2008, which increased compared to 2007 primarily due to strong global demand. Because more than 65% of our total crude oil throughput consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil differential. During 2008, sour crude oil differentials remained wide and improved somewhat in 2008 compared to 2007 levels. Regarding operations, on January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit. We resumed partial operation of the refinery in mid February, and during the second quarter of 2008 we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery. During the third quarter of 2008, certain of our refineries were shut down as a result of two hurricanes that impacted the Gulf Coast. 26 Table of Contents Although we avoided major damage from the hurricanes, repair costs and downtime attributable to the hurricanes and the Aruba downtime reduced our results of operations for 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.15 per share and purchased 23.0 million shares of our common stock under our board authorized programs, which represented more than 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2008. We also redeemed $350 million of 9.5% callable debt that was due in 2013 and invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. 27 Table of Contents RESULTS OF

references on pages 28 through 31. (a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company (Husky). Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery for the six months of 2007 prior to its sale, as well as the gain on the sale of the refinery, are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $827 million ($426 million after tax), which is included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007. (b) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1 billion ($4.0 billion after tax). This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (c) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (d) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (e) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (f) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (g) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. 31 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 25% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices. Refined product prices were significantly higher in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period of 2007, but fourth quarter 2008 refined product prices declined to levels substantially below the fourth quarter of 2007. This resulted in a $10.1 billion decrease in fourth quarter 2008 revenues compared to 2007, which lowered the revenue increase for the year to $23.8 billion. Offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs. Operating income decreased $6.4 billion, or 92%, and income from continuing operations decreased $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $6.6 billion decrease in refining segment operating income. The decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of $4.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, see Impairment of Assets under Critical Accounting Policies Involving Critical Accounting Estimates below for a detailed analysis of the methodology and assumptions used in the determination of this goodwill impairment loss. The goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 for comparability purposes. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery and the gain on its sale, which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery effective July 1, 2007 as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $797 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting mainly from the $4.1 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above, a 12% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, a 12% increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense), and a 6% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery effective July 1, 2008, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors: Distillate margins in 2008 increased in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2007. The increase in distillate margins was primarily due to strong global demand. Gasoline margins decreased significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to the margins in 2007. The decline in gasoline margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, propylene, and petroleum coke declined from 2007 to 2008 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the large increase in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil in 2008 remained favorable and were wider than the differentials in 2007. These favorable differentials were attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel. Throughput volumes decreased 155,000 barrels per day during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a fire in the vacuum unit at our Aruba Refinery in January of 2008, downtime for 32 Table of Contents maintenance at our Port Arthur and Delaware City Refineries, unplanned downtime at our Port Arthur, Texas City, St. Charles, and Houston Refineries related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, and economic decisions to reduce throughputs in certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market fundamentals, partially offset by the 2007 shutdown of our McKee Refinery discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughput margin in 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.78 per barrel, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Per barrel operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs, as well as the effect of the throughput volume decline discussed above. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 9% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This 48% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a $0.055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased in store sales in our U.S. retail operations. The significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a $13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P. Other income, net decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets. These decreases were partially offset by income related to the Alon earn out agreement discussed in Notes 2 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program, an increase in earnings from our equity investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, and a $14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Income tax expense decreased $694 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income, excluding the effect on operating income of the $4.1 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect. Excluding this goodwill impairment loss, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. 33 Table of Contents Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents a $426 million after tax gain on the sale of the Lima Refinery effective July 1, 2007 and net income from its operations prior to the sale. 34 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2007 (a) 2006 (a) Change Operating revenues $ 95,327 $ 87,640 $ 7,687 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 81,645 73,863 7,782 Refining operating expenses 4,016 3,622 394 Retail selling expenses 750 719 31 General and administrative expenses 638 598 40 Depreciation and amortization expense: Refining 1,222 985 237 Retail 90 87 3 Corporate 48 44 4 Total costs and expenses 88,409 79,918 8,491 Operating income 6,918 7,722 (804 ) Equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P.

(a) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. (b) On December 22, 2006, we sold our remaining ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (formerly Valero GP Holdings, LLC), which indirectly owned the general partner interest, the incentive distribution rights, and a 21.4% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. (formerly Valero L.P.). As a result, the financial highlights reflect no equity in earnings of NuStar Energy L.P. or minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC subsequent to December 21, 2006. (c) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (d) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (e) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (f) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (g) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. (h) The market reference differential for ultra low sulfur diesel was not available prior to May 1, 2006, and therefore no market reference differential is presented for the year ended December 31, 2006. 38 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. Operating income decreased $804 million, or 10%, and income from continuing operations decreased $722 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an $827 million decrease in refining segment operating income. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery, which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $8.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulting mainly from increased refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense) of $631 million. In addition, total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by $196 million due to a $0.14 per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.40 per barrel, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation and related benefits, outside services, and energy costs, as well as increased accruals for sales and use taxes. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst amortization, and the write off of costs related to the McKee Refinery as a result of a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit in February 2007. Total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors: Overall, gasoline and distillate margins relative to WTI increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a decline in refined product inventory levels resulting from unplanned refinery outages, lower imports, more stringent product specifications and regulations, and heavy industry turnaround activity, as well as moderately stronger demand. Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2007 decreased from the strong differentials in 2006. However, other light, sweet crude oils priced at a premium to WTI in 2007; thus, sour crude oil feedstock differentials relative to those other light, sweet crude oils in 2007 were comparable to the wide differentials experienced in 2006. These wide differentials are attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand. Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. Throughput volumes decreased 13,000 barrels per day during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a reduction in throughput volumes at our McKee Refinery as a result of the fire discussed above. 39 Table of Contents Retail Retail operating income was $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This 37% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased in store sales and improved retail fuel margins in our U.S. and Canadian retail operations, partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, increased $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses, an increase in employee compensation and benefits, including incentive compensation, a $13 million termination fee paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P., and increased charitable contributions, partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel that were not incurred during 2007. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $91 million pre tax gain related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a pre tax gain of $328 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these effects, other income, net increased $54 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007. Interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $2.25 billion of notes in June 2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program (as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), increased interest on tax liabilities, and reduced capitalized interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction. Income tax expense decreased $450 million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of pre tax income contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non taxable in Aruba through December 31, 2010, combined with favorable tax law changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, increased $493 million from the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2007 due primarily to a pre tax gain of $827 million, or $426 million after tax, on the sale of the Lima Refinery in July 2007 combined with a $67 million increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery between the two years. The increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery was mainly attributable to a 94% increase in the refinerys throughput margin per barrel, from $8.99 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2006 to $17.41 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2007, which more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of operations in 2007 prior to its sale. 40 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Based on current forward market indicators, we expect both refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials for 2009 to be lower than the corresponding amounts reported in 2008. We expect the current economic slowdown to unfavorably impact demand for refined products. Although gasoline margins in the first quarter of 2009 have recovered somewhat from the negative margins experienced in late 2008, gasoline margins are expected to remain under pressure until demand begins to recover. Distillate margins are also expected to be unfavorably affected by reduced demand attributable to the current economic recession. We believe that distillate margins will continue to depend primarily on the pace of global economic activity and the rate at which new refining capacity is brought online. In regard to feedstocks, thus far in 2009, sour crude oil differentials have decreased from fourth quarter 2008 levels and are expected to remain lower for the first half of 2009. Reduced overall crude oil production by OPEC has caused a reduction in the supply of sour crude oil and a resulting increase in the price of such crude oils relative to sweet crude oils. In light of the current and expanding weakness in the U.S. and global economies, we expect 2009 will be a challenging year for the refining industry and our company. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.0 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations, after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at December 31, 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007. Receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the Lima Refinery to Husky and the timing of receivable collections at year end 2007. The change in working capital for 2007 includes a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility as discussed below in the discussion of 2007 versus 2006 cash flows. See the 2007 cash flow discussion below for information related to the cash flows of the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008, combined with $1.5 billion of available cash on hand and $463 million of proceeds from the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, were used mainly to: fund $3.2 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; make an early redemption of our 9.5% senior notes for $367 million and scheduled debt repayments of $7 million; purchase 23.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $955 million; fund a $25 million contingent earn out payment in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, an $87 million acquisition of retail fuel sites, and a $57 million acquisition primarily of an interest in a refined product pipeline; and pay common stock dividends of $299 million. 41 Table of Contents Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $5.3 billion compared to $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations and a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility, as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006. Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash flows for each period presented. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $260 million and $215 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to the Lima Refinery was $14 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007, combined with $2.2 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long term notes, $2.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of our Lima Refinery, a $311 million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation cost, and $159 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to: fund $2.8 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; purchase 84.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.8 billion; make an early debt redemption of $183 million and scheduled debt repayments of $280 million; fund capital contributions, net of distributions, of $209 million to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company mainly to enable the joint venture to redeem all of its outstanding debt; fund contingent earn out payments in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and the Delaware City Refinery of $50 million and $25 million, respectively; pay common stock dividends of $271 million; and increase available cash on hand by $874 million. Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2008, we expended $2.8 billion for capital expenditures and $408 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $479 million of costs related to environmental projects. In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level (see the discussion in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Payments due under this earn out arrangement were limited based on annual and aggregate limits. In January 2008, we made a $25 million earn out payment related to the St. Charles Refinery, which was the final payment based on the aggregate limitation under that agreement. Subsequent to this payment, we have no further commitments with respect to contingent earn out agreements. For 2009, we expect to incur approximately $2.7 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.2 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $635 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $490 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure 42 Table of Contents estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Krotz Springs Refinery Disposition Effective July 1, 2008, we consummated the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon), a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy, Inc. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $305 million, or $170 million after tax. Cash proceeds, net of certain costs related to the sale, were $463 million, including approximately $135 million from the sale of working capital to Alon primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. In addition to the cash consideration received, we also received contingent consideration in the form of a three year earn out agreement based on certain product margins, which had a fair value of $171 million as of July 1, 2008. We have hedged the risk of a decline in the referenced product margins by entering into certain commodity derivative contracts. In addition, we entered into various agreements with Alon as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 are summarized below (in millions). Payments Due by Period 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Debt and capital lease obligations $ 315 $ 39 $ 424 $ 765 $ 495 $ 4,619 $ 6,657 Operating lease obligations 397 272 174 84 51 257 1,235 Purchase obligations 12,812 2,507 1,589 1,208 623 1,752 20,491 Other long term liabilities 163 150 150 149 1,549 2,161 Total $ 13,524 $ 2,981 $ 2,337 $ 2,207 $ 1,318 $ 8,177 $ 30,544 Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Payments for debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values and minimum rental payments, respectively. On February 1, 2008, we redeemed our 9.50% senior notes for $367 million, or 104.75% of stated value. In addition, in March 2008, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $7 million related to certain of our other debt. As of December 31, 2008, current portion of debt and capital lease obligations as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes that matures in April 2009, $100 million of debt secured by certain of our accounts receivable that matures in June 2009 (discussed below), and the remaining $9 million of our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds that matures in April 2009. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. In June 2008, we amended the agreement to extend the maturity date from August 2008 to June 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party entities and financial institutions was $100 million; the proceeds from the sale are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. The amount outstanding as of December 31, 2008 was repaid in February 2009. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes additional discussion of this program. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment 43 Table of Contents grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2008, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard Poors Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook) Moodys Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in other long term liabilities. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, our short term and long term purchase obligations decreased by $18.2 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2007. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Other Long term Liabilities Our other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2008. 44 Table of Contents Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2008, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Letter of credit facility $300 million June 2009 Letter of credit facility $275 million July 2009 Revolving credit facility $2.5 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 In June 2008, we entered into a one year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million. In July 2008, we entered into another one year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $275 million. Both of these credit facilities support certain of our crude oil purchases. We are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with these letter of credit facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had $201 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, $431 million of letters of credit outstanding under our three U.S. committed revolving credit facilities, and Cdn. $19 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2009 and 2010. Stock Purchase Programs On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a new $3 billion common stock purchase program. This program is in addition to the remaining amount under the $6 billion program previously authorized. This new $3 billion program has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2008, we had made no purchases of our common stock under the new $3 billion program. As of December 31, 2008, we have approvals under these stock purchase programs to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. During 2008, we purchased 18.0 million shares of our common stock for $667 million under our $6 billion common stock purchase program and 5.0 million shares for $288 million in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans. These purchases represented approximately 4% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2008. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2008, we contributed $110 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.40% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 76% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2008. The fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was in excess of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of December 31, 2007. However, due primarily to a significant decline in the fair value of the plan assets during 2008 resulting from unfavorable economic and market conditions, the qualified pension plans were underfunded as of December 31, 2008. Although we have only $8 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2009 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we plan to contribute approximately $130 million to our Qualified Plans during 2009. In January 2009, $50 million of this total expected contribution was contributed to our main Qualified Plan. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas 45 Table of Contents emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through December 31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. Accordingly, no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to this turnover tax on exports. We commenced arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we are seeking to enforce our rights under the tax holiday and other agreements related to the refinery. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3 4, 2009. We anticipate a decision sometime later this year. We have also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV (CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings. Amounts deposited under this escrow agreement, which totaled $102 million as of December 31, 2008, are reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the turnover tax described above, the GOA has also asserted other tax amounts aggregating approximately $25 million related to dividends and other tax items. The GOA, through the arbitration, is also now questioning the validity of the tax holiday generally, although the GOA has never issued any formal assessment for profit tax at any time during the tax holiday period. We believe that the provisions of our tax holiday agreement exempt us from all of these taxes and, accordingly, no expense or liability has been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. We are also challenging approximately $30 million in foreign exchange payments made to the Central Bank of Aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. These taxes and assessments are also being addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above. Other In July 2008, we entered into an agreement to participate as a prospective shipper on the 500,000 barrel per day expansion of the Keystone crude oil pipeline system, which is expected to be completed by 2012. Once completed, the pipeline will enable crude oil to be transported from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast at Port Arthur, Texas. In addition to our commitment to ship crude oil through the pipeline, we have an option to acquire an equity interest in the Keystone partnerships. We have also secured commitments from several Canadian oil producers to sell to us heavy sour crude oil for shipment through the pipeline. During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we submitted claims to our insurance 46 Table of Contents carriers under our insurance policies. We reached a settlement with the insurance carriers on our claims, resulting in pre tax income of approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2008 that was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. On January 25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery was shut down due to a fire in its vacuum unit. During the second quarter, we completed the repairs and resumed full operations of the refinery. This incident reduced our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008. In November 2007, we announced plans to explore strategic alternatives related to our Aruba Refinery. We are continuing to pursue potential transactions for this refinery, which may include the sale of the refinery. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. 47 Table of Contents Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Due to adverse changes in market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008, as discussed further below in our discussion of goodwill, we evaluated our significant operating assets for potential impairment as of December 31, 2008, and we determined that the carrying amount of each of these assets was recoverable. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. In regard to goodwill, we have historically performed our goodwill impairment test as of October 1 of each year. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, there were severe disruptions in the capital and commodities markets that contributed to a significant decline in our common stock price, thus causing our market capitalization to decline to a level substantially below our net book value. Because a low market capitalization relative to net book value represents a key indicator that goodwill may be impaired, we determined that goodwill needed to be evaluated for impairment as of December 31, 2008 in addition to our normal annual testing date. As of the date of this goodwill impairment evaluation, all of our goodwill was allocated among four reporting units, namely each of the four geographic regions of our refining segment (the Gulf Coast, Mid Continent, Northeast, and West Coast regions). No goodwill was reported in our retail segment. Goodwill impairment testing is comprised of two steps. The first step (step 1) is to compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including any goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its recorded net book value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test (step 2) is required to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the estimated fair value derived for the reporting unit in step 1 is deemed to represent the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of that reporting unit. The fair values of each of the reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities are determined as they would be in a purchase business combination, and the excess of the deemed purchase price over the net fair value of all of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying amount of that reporting units goodwill exceeds this implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to the implied fair value determined in this hypothetical purchase price allocation. 48 Table of Contents Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, the impairment testing rules required management to exercise its judgment to determine the estimated fair values of our four reporting units for purposes of performing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. Management considered the cyclicality of the refining business in deriving the set of prices that were applied to the anticipated charge and production volumes in each reporting unit. In determining the present values of each reporting units cash flow streams, management utilized discount rates that were commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. To this applicable discount rate, management added a reasonable risk premium in order to consider the impact of volatility within the refining industry and current tightness in the capital markets on an investors required rate of return. An important requirement related to this fair value determination process is to reconcile the sum of the fair values determined for the various reporting units to our market capitalization. In order to perform this reconciliation, we first determined a fair value for our retail segment using an appropriate discount rate. Then we compared the sum of the fair values of the retail segment and the four refining reporting units to our total enterprise value, with our market capitalization determined based on our common stock price as of December 31, 2008. For this purpose, we also added a control premium to our market capitalization, in recognition of the fact that an acquiring entity generally is willing to pay more for equity ownership that gives it a controlling interest than an individual investor would pay for shares that constitute less than a controlling interest. The control premium that we added to our market capitalization represented a reasonable premium for acquisitions in our industry. Because the enterprise value, including the control premium, was comparable to the sum of the fair values determined above, we concluded that the assumptions utilized to determine the fair values of our reporting units were reasonable. The computed fair value of each of the reporting units was less than its net book value including goodwill, and therefore the goodwill in each of the reporting units was potentially impaired. We then applied step 2 of the goodwill impairment test to each of the reporting units, with the fair value for each reporting unit derived in step 1 constituting the assumed purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of each of those reporting units. In allocating value to the property, plant and equipment of each of the reporting units, we used current replacement costs for the refineries that comprised each reporting unit and applied a depreciation factor based on historical depreciation. We adjusted deferred income taxes based on the fair value assigned to property, plant and equipment and reflected the fair value of inventory and other working capital included in each reporting unit. Our calculations indicated that the net fair value of each reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities was significantly in excess of the deemed purchase price, and therefore no implied fair value of goodwill existed in any of the four reporting units. As a result, we concluded that an impairment of the entire amount of recorded goodwill was required, which resulted in a $4.1 billion pre tax goodwill impairment loss, or $4.0 billion after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental 49 Table of Contents laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2009 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 66 $ 15 Compensation rate increase 28 Health care cost trend rate increase 9 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 10 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 4 Compensation rate increase 6 Health care cost trend rate increase 1 Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and 50 Table of Contents different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). From time to time, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. Finally, we enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See Derivative Instruments in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 51 Table of Contents The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain recognized refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a fair value of $5.1 billion and $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. Economic Hedges Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases; and manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the Alon earn out agreement as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. Trading Activities These represent derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products) or in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products) or amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 52 Table of Contents December 31, 2008 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 6,904 N/A $ 48.28 $ 333 $ 320 $ 13 Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 60,162 $ 121.69 58.44 N/A (3,805 ) (3,805 ) 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 4,680 63.72 64.03 N/A 1 1 Swaps short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 60,162 62.38 129.80 N/A 4,056 4,056 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 4,680 76.32 78.69 N/A 11 11 Futures long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 780 38.62 N/A 30 27 (3 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 25,987 96.88 55.25 N/A (1,082 ) (1,082 ) 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 19,734 105.96 63.94 N/A (829 ) (829 ) 2011 (crude oil and refined products) 3,900 124.78 67.99 N/A (221 ) (221 ) Swaps short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 25,931 59.65 106.81 N/A 1,223 1,223 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 19,734 72.18 121.96 N/A 982 982 2011 (crude oil and refined products) 3,900 74.08 136.66 N/A 244 244 Futures long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 135,882 59.17 N/A 8,040 7,319 (721 ) 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 3,466 78.33 N/A 271 240 (31 ) 2009 (natural gas) 4,310 8.46 N/A 36 24 (12 ) Futures short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 135,091 N/A 62.74 8,475 7,510 965 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 3,692 N/A 84.66 313 276 37 2009 (natural gas) 4,310 N/A 5.68 24 24 Options long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 57 60.64 N/A 1 (1 ) Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 19,887 77.56 45.09 N/A (646 ) (646 ) 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 10,050 40.66 35.35 N/A (53 ) (53 ) 2011 (crude oil and refined products) 1,950 78.36 65.80 N/A (24 ) (24 ) Swaps short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 16,084 56.44 97.17 N/A 655 655 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 5,850 64.19 73.12 N/A 52 52 2011 (crude oil and refined products) 1,950 68.06 80.59 N/A 24 24 53 Table of Contents December 31, 2008 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Futures long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 24,039 $ 71.70 N/A $ 1,724 $ 1,300 $ (424 ) 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 956 84.12 N/A 80 70 (10 ) 2009 (natural gas) 200 5.79 N/A 1 1 Futures short: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 21,999 N/A 73.38 1,614 1,209 405 2010 (crude oil and refined products) 956 N/A 83.63 80 70 10 2009 (natural gas) 200 N/A 5.82 1 1 Options long: 2009 (crude oil and refined products) 100 30.00 N/A Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ 816 54 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive Contract Market Fair Volumes Price Price Value Value Value Fair Value Hedges: Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 68,873 $ 97.69 N/A $ 6,728 $ 6,961 $ 233 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 79,188 N/A $ 96.89 7,673 8,005 (332 ) Cash Flow Hedges: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 81.44 98.50 N/A 310 310 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 18,175 102.55 86.25 N/A (296 ) (296 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 80,960 103.50 N/A 8,379 8,596 217 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 73,735 N/A 103.62 7,640 7,826 (186 ) Economic Hedges: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 12,012 33.16 39.48 N/A 76 76 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 7,397 63.91 54.25 N/A (71 ) (71 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 77,902 96.20 N/A 7,494 7,802 308 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 76,426 N/A 96.18 7,351 7,663 (312 ) Options long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 89 47.72 N/A 1 1 Trading Activities: Swaps long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 14,677 11.77 12.98 N/A 18 18 Swaps short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 15,952 12.47 11.56 N/A (15 ) (15 ) Futures long: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,801 98.01 N/A 2,823 2,923 100 Futures short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 28,766 N/A 98.20 2,824 2,920 (96 ) Options short: 2008 (crude oil and refined products) 66 N/A 49.00 1 1 Total pre tax fair value of open positions $ (45 ) 55 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2008, we had commitments to purchase $280 million of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January 30, 2009, resulting in a 2009 gain of $2 million. 56 Table of Contents
