We reported a loss from continuing operations of $352 million, or $0.65 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $1.0 billion, or $1.93 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of continuing operations for 2009 were unfavorably impacted by asset impairment losses of $230 million ($150 million after tax), which are discussed further below, as well as a $140 million loss contingency accrual (including interest) related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales and other tax matters involving the Government of Aruba. The 2008 results included a before tax and after tax loss of $4.0 billion resulting from the impairment of goodwill, which is further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, 2008 results included $86 million of pre tax asset impairment losses ($56 million after tax) and a $305 million pre tax gain ($170 million after tax) on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery. In November 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery due to financial losses caused by poor economic conditions, significant capital spending requirements, and high operating costs. As a result of the shutdown, we recorded a pre tax loss of $1.9 billion, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which include this loss and other asset impairment losses, are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Due to the impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals during 2009, we continued to assess our refining segment assets for potential impairment. This evaluation included an assessment of our operating assets as well as an evaluation of our capital projects classified as construction in progress. As a result of this analysis, certain capital projects were permanently cancelled, resulting in pre tax write offs of $230 million of project costs relating to continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally during 2009, we wrote off pre tax project costs of $178 million related to our Delaware City Refinery, which are reported in discontinued operations as discussed above. Also due to these poor industry conditions, in June 2009, we announced our plan to shut down the Aruba Refinery temporarily as narrow heavy sour crude oil differentials made the refinery uneconomical to operate. The Aruba Refinery was shut down in July 2009 and is expected to continue to be shut down until market conditions improve. Our profitability from our operations is substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude oil, referred to as the refined product margin. The economic slowdown that existed throughout 2009 caused a continuing weakness in demand for refined products, which put pressure on refined product margins during 2009. This reduced demand, combined with increased inventory levels, caused a significant decline in diesel and jet fuel margins during 2009 compared to 2008. However, gasoline margins improved in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, lower costs of crude oil and other feedstocks significantly improved margins on certain secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, and petroleum coke, during 2009 compared to 2008. Because more than 60% of our total crude oil throughput generally consists of sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that historically have been purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is also significantly affected by the spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil differential. Sour crude oil differentials for the year ended December 31, 2009 were substantially lower than the 2008 differentials. We believe that this decline in sour crude oil differentials was partially caused by a reduction in sour crude oil production by OPEC and 28 Table of Contents other producers, which reduced the supply of sour crude oil and increased the price of sour crude oils relative to sweet crude oils. In addition, high prices of residual fuel oil relative to sweet crude oil prices caused a significant reduction in discounts realized on residual fuel oil that we processed during 2009. These higher residual fuel oil prices also contributed to the decrease in sour crude oil differentials because sour crude oil competes with residual fuel oil as a refinery feedstock. In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 10 year notes and $250 million of 30 year notes. Proceeds from these notes were used to make $209 million of scheduled debt payments in April 2009, fund our acquisition of certain ethanol plants from VeraSun, and maintain our capital investment program. In April and May of 2009, we acquired seven ethanol plants and a site under development from VeraSun for $477 million, plus $79 million primarily for inventory and certain other working capital. The new ethanol business reported $165 million of operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009. In June 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock at a price of $18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of $799 million. 29 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 Compared to 2008 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2009 (a) (b) 2008

notes relate to references on pages 30 through 34. (a) The information presented for 2009 includes the operations related to certain ethanol plants acquired from VeraSun during 2009. On April 1, 2009, we closed on the acquisition of ethanol plants located in Charles City, Fort Dodge, and Hartley, Iowa; Aurora, South Dakota; and Welcome, Minnesota; and through subsequent closings on April 9, 2009 and May 8, 2009, we acquired ethanol plants in Albert City, Iowa and Albion, Nebraska. The ethanol production volumes reflected for the year ended December 31, 2009 are based on 365 calendar days rather than the actual daily production, which varied by facility. (b) Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of 2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery, as well as costs associated with the shutdown, are reported as discontinued operations for 2009 and 2008, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years. (c) Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and significance of our post closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2008. The pre tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per barrel operating highlights. (d) The asset impairment loss for 2009 relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as construction in progress as a result of the unfavorable impact of the continuing economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. Losses resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the 2009 presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008. (e) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre tax and 34 Table of Contents after tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million, including interest, was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax of $114 million was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. (j) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials and the corn crush, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The corn crush represents the posted New York Harbor ethanol price from Oil Price Information Services less the posted corn price from the Chicago Board of Trade and assumes a yield of 2.75 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (k) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues decreased 40% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of lower average refined product prices between the two periods. Operating income declined $819 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the amount for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to an $890 million decrease in refining segment operating income discussed below. Despite the decline in operating income, our income from continuing operations increased from 2008 to 2009 due to a $1.6 billion reduction in income tax expense, largely attributable to the nondeductibility of almost all of the goodwill impairment loss that is included in the 2008 operating income, as discussed further below. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating income was attributable primarily to a $305 million gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery in the third quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $143 million increase in asset impairment losses (as further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba (as further discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), a 47% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, and an 8% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 (as further discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a 16% decrease in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense). Total refining throughput margins for 2009 compared to 2008 were impacted by the following factors: Distillate margins in 2009 decreased significantly in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2008. The decrease in distillate margins was primarily due to increased inventory levels and reduced demand attributable to the global slowdown in economic activity. 35 Table of Contents Sour crude oil and residual fuel oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2009 declined significantly compared to the differentials in 2008. The unfavorable sour crude oil differentials were attributable mainly to reduced production of sour crude oil by OPEC and other producers as well as high relative prices for residual fuel oil with which sour crude oil competes as a refinery feedstock. Gasoline margins increased in all of our refining regions in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a better balance of supply and demand. Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, and petroleum coke improved significantly from 2008 to 2009 as prices for these products did not decrease in proportion to the large decrease in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. The price of WTI crude oil declined by approximately $38 per barrel, or 38%, from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009. Throughput margin for 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption insurance settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughput volumes decreased 205,000 barrels per day during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to (i) the temporary shutdown of our Aruba Refinery commencing in July 2009, (ii) the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in July 2008, (iii) unplanned downtime at our St. Charles Refinery, (iv) planned downtime for maintenance at our Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Paulsboro, and Three Rivers Refineries, and (v) economic decisions to reduce throughput at certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market conditions. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 22% lower for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a decrease in energy costs, lower maintenance expenses, a reduction in sales and use taxes, and $43 million of operating expenses related to the Krotz Springs Refinery prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 4% from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the completion of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This 21% decrease was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins, partially offset by lower selling expenses, in our U.S. retail operations. Ethanol Ethanol operating income was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the VeraSun Acquisition subsequent to their acquisition in the second quarter of 2009, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization expense, increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to increases in litigation costs, severance expenses, and acquisition costs, partially offset by reductions in environmental costs and professional fees. 36 Table of Contents Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon earn out agreement and associated derivative instruments (as discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and the nonrecurrence of a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $55 million increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and $27 million of income in 2009 resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to the UDS Acquisition due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Interest and debt expense increased mainly due to interest incurred on $1 billion of debt issued in March 2009. Income tax expense decreased $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion of expense in 2008 to a $97 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of almost all of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 results of operations, as discussed above. Excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss on the effective tax rate for 2008, our 2009 effective tax rate was lower than 2008 primarily due to a higher percentage of the pre tax loss being attributable to the Aruba Refinery in 2009, the profits or losses of which are not taxed through December 31, 2010. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes increased $1.5 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the after tax effect of the following changes in the results of operations related to the Delaware City Refinery: (i) a $1.9 billion loss related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009, (ii) a $360 million increase in asset impairment losses, and (iii) a $260 million increase in operating losses. The shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 Financial Highlights (millions of dollars,

references on pages 38 through 41. (a) Due to the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery during the fourth quarter of 2009, the results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery are reported as discontinued operations for 2008 and 2007, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Northeast Region, exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years. (b) Effective July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon. The nature and significance of our post closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast region, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. The pre tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per barrel operating highlights. (c) Effective July 1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky Refining Company (Husky). Therefore, the results of operations of the Lima Refinery for the six months of 2007 prior to its sale, as well as the gain on the sale of the refinery, are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid Continent region, exclude the Lima Refinery. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $827 million ($426 million after tax), which is included in Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007. (d) Losses resulting from the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects in 2008 have been reclassified from operating expenses and presented separately for comparability with the 2009 presentation. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel, resulting in an adjustment to the operating costs per barrel previously reported in 2008. (e) Upon applying the goodwill impairment testing criteria under existing accounting rules during the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre tax and after tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 in order to make that information comparable between periods. (f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes. 41 Table of Contents (g) Other products primarily include gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt. (h) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale effective July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City and Paulsboro Refineries; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. (i) The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent Commodity Information Services London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability. (j) The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 26% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices. Offsetting the higher revenues were substantially higher average feedstock costs. Operating income decreased $5.9 billion, or 89%, and income from continuing operations decreased $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $6.1 billion decrease in refining segment operating income. The decrease was primarily due to a goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 for comparability purposes. The refining segment operating income and income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 exclude (i) the operations of the Lima Refinery and the gain on its sale effective July 1, 2007 and (ii) the operations of the Delaware City Refinery due to its permanent shutdown in November 2009, which are both classified as discontinued operations as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 to $995 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting mainly from the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above, an 11% decrease in throughput margin per barrel, a 10% increase in refining operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization expense), and a 5% decline in throughput volumes. These decreases were partially offset by a $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery effective July 1, 2008, which is discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total refining throughput margins for 2008 compared to 2007 were impacted by the following factors: Distillate margins in 2008 increased in all of our refining regions from the margins in 2007. The increase in distillate margins was primarily due to strong global demand. Gasoline margins decreased significantly in all of our refining regions in 2008 compared to the margins in 2007. The decline in gasoline margins was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline demand and an increase in ethanol production. Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, propylene, and petroleum coke declined from 2007 to 2008 as prices for these products did not increase in proportion to the large increase in the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them. 42 Table of Contents Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil in 2008 remained favorable and were wider than the differentials in 2007. These favorable differentials were attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel. Throughput volumes decreased 130,000 barrels per day during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a fire in the vacuum unit at our Aruba Refinery in January of 2008, downtime for maintenance at our Port Arthur Refinery, unplanned downtime at our Port Arthur, Texas City, St. Charles, and Houston Refineries related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, and economic decisions to reduce throughputs in certain of our refineries as a result of unfavorable market fundamentals, partially offset by the 2007 shutdown of our McKee Refinery discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughput margin in 2008 included approximately $100 million related to the McKee Refinery business interruption insurance settlement discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $0.61 per barrel, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating expenses increased mainly due to an increase in energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 10% from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects and increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This 48% increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a $0.055 per gallon increase in retail fuel margins and increased in store sales in our U.S. retail operations. The significant improvement in fuel margins was largely the result of rapidly declining crude oil prices in the second half of 2008. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense, decreased $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses combined with the nonrecurrence of 2007 expenses related to executive retirement costs and a $13 million termination fee paid for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P. Other income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to a $91 million foreign currency exchange rate gain in 2007 resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary, reduced interest income resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a reduction in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets. These decreases were partially offset by income related to the Alon earn out agreement discussed in Notes 2, 17, and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, lower costs incurred under our accounts receivable sales program, an increase in earnings from our equity investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, and a $14 million gain in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense decreased primarily due to reduced interest on tax liabilities, partially offset by higher average debt balances. 43 Table of Contents Income tax expense decreased $520 million from 2007 to 2008 mainly as a result of lower operating income, excluding the effect on operating income of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss discussed above that has an insignificant tax effect. Excluding this goodwill impairment loss, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was comparable to the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents a $119 million net loss on the operations of the Delaware City Refinery, which was reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the permanent shutdown of the refinery effective November 20, 2009. Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents a $426 million after tax gain on the sale of the Lima Refinery effective July 1, 2007, $243 million of net income from the Lima Refinery operations prior to its sale, and $188 million of net income from the operations of the Delaware City Refinery. OUTLOOK High crude oil prices in 2008 and a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009 caused a large reduction in demand for refined products over the past two years. This demand reduction plus the addition of new refining capacity around the world have resulted in a significant amount of excess global refining capacity, which led to an increase in global refined product inventories and lower refined product margins. In addition, the decrease in demand for refined products contributed to lower production of sour crude oil versus sweet crude oil, which narrowed the differentials between sour and sweet crude oil prices. As 2010 progresses, we expect the United States and worldwide economies to begin to recover, and we expect refined product demand to begin to grow accordingly. The increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils. These expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should result in improved refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials. However, improvements in refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials are expected to be significantly constrained during 2010 by the start up of new worldwide refining capacity that will mitigate the reduction in spare capacity that would otherwise result from the improved demand. Until the economy recovers and demand improves, we expect that the current low refined product margins and sour crude oil differentials will result in production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry. In July, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery due to poor economics resulting from the current unfavorable industry fundamentals. The Aruba Refinery continues to be shut down temporarily, and it is expected to remain shut down until industry conditions improve. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery. We are currently monitoring, and will continue to monitor, all of our other refineries to assess whether complete or partial shutdown of certain of those facilities is appropriate until conditions improve. We expect that refinery production cutbacks and shutdowns of less profitable refineries will occur throughout the refining industry during 2010 until industry conditions improve. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 billion compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the $4.4 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations, after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss, asset 44 Table of Contents impairment losses, and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, all of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net $1.4 billion favorable effect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable in the two years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to a significant increase in gasoline, distillate, and crude oil prices at December 31, 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009, combined with $998 million of proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion of notes in March 2009 as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables, and $115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to: fund $2.7 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; fund the VeraSun Acquisition for $556 million; make long term note repayments of $285 million; and pay common stock dividends of $324 million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.1 billion compared to $5.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under Results of Operations, after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss included in the 2008 operating income that had no effect on cash. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable decreased in 2008 due to a significant decrease in crude oil and refined product prices at December 31, 2008 compared to such prices at the end of 2007. Receivables for 2008 also decreased due to the termination in the first quarter of 2008 of certain agreements related to the sale of the Lima Refinery to Husky and the timing of receivable collections at year end 2007. The change in working capital for 2007 includes a $900 million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales facility. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008, combined with $1.5 billion of available cash on hand and $463 million of proceeds from the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, were used mainly to: fund $3.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; make an early redemption of our 9.5% senior notes for $367 million and scheduled debt repayments of $7 million; purchase 23.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $955 million; fund a $25 million contingent earn out payment in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, an $87 million acquisition of retail fuel sites, and a $57 million acquisition primarily of an interest in a refined product pipeline; and pay common stock dividends of $299 million. 45 Table of Contents Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Delaware City Refinery and the Lima Refinery have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities: Delaware City Refinery $ (126 ) $ 81 $ 348 Lima Refinery 260 Cash used in investing activities: Delaware City Refinery (153 ) (268 ) (130 ) Lima Refinery (14 ) Capital Investments During the year ended December 31, 2009, we expended $2.3 billion for capital expenditures and $415 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2009 included $390 million of costs related to environmental projects. For 2010, we expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.5 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $795 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants from ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC for a total purchase price of approximately $200 million. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin from Renew Energy LLC for $72 million plus certain receivables and inventories.

In March 2009, we issued $750 million of 9.375% notes due March 15, 2019 and $250 million of 10.5% notes due March 15, 2039. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $998 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other issuance costs of $8 million. 46 Table of Contents On April 1, 2009, we made scheduled debt repayments of $200 million related to our 3.5% notes and $9 million related to our 5.125% Series 1997D industrial revenue bonds. On October 15, 2009, we redeemed $76 million of our $100 million of 6.75% senior notes with a maturity date of October 15, 2037 as further discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1 billion of eligible trade receivables. We amended our agreement in June 2009 to extend the maturity date to June 2010. As of December 31, 2008, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party entities and financial institutions was $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold additional eligible receivables under this program of $950 million and repaid $850 million. As of December 31, 2009, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third party entities and financial institutions was $200 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we have reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by $100 million, resulting in a current balance of $100 million of eligible receivables sold to the third party entities and financial institutions. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt in our consolidated balance sheets. In February 2010, we issued $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015 and $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled approximately $1.24 billion, before deducting underwriting discounts of $8 million, and will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of debt. Also in February 2010, we called for redemption our 7.50% senior notes with a maturity date of June 15, 2015 for $294 million, or 102.5% of stated value. The redemption date will be March 15, 2010. These notes will have a carrying amount of $296 million as of the redemption date, resulting in a small gain on the redemption. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating Agency Rating Standard Poors Ratings Services BBB (negative outlook) Moodys Investors Service Baa2 (negative outlook) Fitch Ratings BBB (negative outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. The operating lease 47 Table of Contents obligations reflected in the table above have been reduced by related obligations that are included in other long term liabilities. Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2009, our short term and long term purchase obligations increased by $9.3 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008. Other Long term Liabilities Our other long term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2009. Other Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2009, our committed lines of credit were as follows: Borrowing Capacity Expiration Letter of credit facility $300 million June 2010 Revolving credit facility $2.4 billion November 2012 Canadian revolving credit facility Cdn. $115 million December 2012 In October 2009, Aurora Bank FSB (Aurora, formerly Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB), one of the participating banks under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, failed to fund its loan commitment related to our borrowing under this facility. Auroras aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility was $84 million. As a result, our borrowing capacity under that revolving credit facility was effectively reduced to $2.4 billion. In June 2008, we entered into a one year committed revolving letter of credit facility under which we may obtain letters of credit of up to $300 million to support certain of our crude oil purchases. In June 2009, we amended this agreement to extend the maturity date to June 2010. We are being charged letter of credit issuance fees in connection with this letter of credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. However, we had $259 million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted short term bank credit facilities, $299 million of letters of credit outstanding under our two U.S. committed revolving credit facilities, and Cdn. $22 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2010 and 2011. 48 Table of Contents Common Stock Offering On June 3, 2009, we sold in a public offering 46 million shares of our common stock, which included 6 million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriters, at a price of $18.00 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of $799 million. Stock Purchase Programs As of December 31, 2009, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2009, we contributed $72 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.80% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 97% of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2009. We have less than $1 million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during 2010 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately $50 million to our Qualified Plans during 2010, of which $30 million was contributed during February 2010. Environmental Matters As discussed in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Currently, some of the proposed federal cap and trade legislation would require businesses that emit greenhouse gases to buy emission credits from the government, other businesses, or through an auction process. In addition, refiners would be obligated to purchase emission credits associated with the transportation fuels (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) sold and consumed in the United States. As a result of such a program, we would be required to purchase emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our own operations as well as from the fuels we sell. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final form of a cap and trade bill (or whether such a bill will be passed by Congress), any new federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions including a cap and trade program could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Tax Matters As discussed in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. 49 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2007, the Government of Aruba (GOA) enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which initially was 3% for on island sales and services (but has subsequently been reduced to 1.5%) and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery. We disputed the GOAs assessment of the turnover tax in arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute (NAI) pursuant to which we sought to enforce our rights under a tax holiday agreement related to the refinery and other agreements. The arbitration hearing was held on February 3 4, 2009. We also filed protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. In April 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with the GOA and Caribbean Mercantile Bank NV (CMB), pursuant to which we agreed to deposit an amount equal to the disputed turnover tax on exports into an escrow account with CMB, pending resolution of the tax protest proceedings in Aruba. Under this escrow agreement, we are required to continue to deposit an amount equal to the disputed tax on a monthly basis until the tax dispute is resolved through the Aruba proceedings. On April 20, 2009, we were notified that the Aruban tax court overruled our protests with respect to the turnover tax assessed in January and February 2007, totaling $8 million. Under the escrow agreement, we expensed and paid $8 million, plus $1 million of interest, to the GOA in the second quarter of 2009. Amounts deposited under the escrow agreement, which totaled $115 million and $102 million as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition to the turnover tax described above, the GOA has asserted other tax amounts including approximately $35 million related to various dividends. We also challenged approximately $35 million in foreign exchange payments made to the Central Bank of Aruba as payments exempted under our tax holiday, as well as other reasons. Both the dividend tax and the foreign exchange payment matters were also addressed in the arbitration proceedings discussed above. On November 3, 2009, we received an interim First Partial Award from the NAI arbitral panel. The panels ruling validated our tax holiday agreement, but the panel also ruled in favor of the GOA on our dispute of the $35 million in foreign exchange payments previously made to the Central Bank of Aruba. The panels decision did not, however, fully resolve the remaining two items in the arbitration, the applicable dividend tax rate and the turnover tax. With respect to the dividend tax, the panel ruled that the dividend tax was not a profit tax covered by the tax holiday agreement, but the panel did not address the fact that Aruban companies with tax holidays are subject to a 0% dividend withholding rate rather than the 5% rate alleged by the GOA. With respect to the turnover tax, the panel did reject our contractual claims but it decided that our non contractual claims against the turnover tax merited further discussion with and review by the panel before a final decision could be rendered. Prior to this interim decision, no expense or liability had been recognized in our consolidated financial statements with respect to unfunded amounts. In light of the uncertain timing of any final resolution of these claims as a result of the First Partial Award from the panel, we recorded a loss contingency accrual of approximately $140 million, including interest, with respect to both the dividend and turnover taxes. Following the November ruling, we entered into settlement discussions with the GOA. On February 24, 2010, we signed a settlement agreement that details the parties proposed terms for settlement of these disputes and provides a framework for taxation of our operations in Aruba on a go forward basis as our tax holiday was set to expire on December 31, 2010. Under the proposed settlement, we will make a payment to the GOA of $118 million in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to the effective date of the settlement, including the turnover tax disputed in the Netherlands Arbitration. The GOA will eliminate the turnover tax on exports as of the effective date of the settlement. In addition, we will agree to exit the Tax Holiday regime following the effective date of the settlement agreement and will enter into a new tax regime under which we will be subject to a net profit tax of less than 10% on an overall basis. Beginning on the second anniversary of the settlement agreements effective date, we will also begin to make an annual prepayment of taxes of $10 million, with the ability to carry forward any 50 Table of Contents excess tax prepayments to future tax years. The proposed settlement will not be effective until the settlement agreement is approved by the Aruban Parliament and certain laws and regulations are modified and or established to provide for the terms of the settlement. The parties anticipate that this will occur on or before June 1, 2010. If the settlement is not effective as of June 1, 2010, we both have the right to terminate the settlement agreement and return to arbitration and the on island proceedings to continue litigation. Other Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long lived assets (excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method investments, and deferred tax assets) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the 51 Table of Contents carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations. Due to the effect of the current unfavorable economic conditions on the refining industry, and our expectations of a continuation of such conditions for the near term, we will continue to monitor both our operating assets and our capital projects for additional potential asset impairments until conditions improve. Due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value, changes in market conditions, as well as changes in assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair values and changes in potential asset sales proceeds, could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that management deems to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, such as potential cap and trade legislation as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters, could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 is included in Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25% increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2010 (in millions): Other Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits Increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease $ 61 $ 14 Compensation rate increase 27 Health care cost trend rate increase 10 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease 8 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease 4 Compensation rate increase 6 Health care cost trend rate increase 1 See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the 53 Table of Contents sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined product, and grain prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these inventories (fair value hedges). From time to time, we use commodity derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases (cash flow hedges). We also use commodity derivative instruments that do not receive hedge accounting treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in income. Finally, we enter into commodity derivative instruments based on our fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See Derivatives and Hedging in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps, futures, and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions, except for the weighted average pay and receive prices as described below), including: Fair Value Hedges Fair value hedges are used to hedge certain refining inventories (which had a carrying amount of $4.4 billion as of both December 31, 2009 and 2008, and a fair value of $8.9 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) and our unrecognized firm commitments (i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the future). The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period. 54 Table of Contents Cash Flow Hedges Cash flow hedges are used to hedge certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. Economic Hedges Economic hedges are hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges that are used to: manage price volatility in refinery feedstock, refined product, and grain inventories; and manage price volatility in forecasted refinery feedstock, product, and grain purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases. In addition, through August 2009, we used economic hedges to manage price volatility in the referenced product margins associated with the three year earn out agreement with Alon that was entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery, but which was settled in the third quarter of 2009 as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative instruments related to economic hedges are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. Trading Activities These represent commodity derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The derivative instruments entered into by us for trading activities are recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the reporting period. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels (for crude oil and refined products), in billions of British thermal units (for natural gas), or in thousands of bushels (for grain). The weighted average pay and receive prices represent amounts per barrel (for crude oil and refined products), amounts per million British thermal units (for natural gas), or amounts per bushel (for grain). Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume, while the market value amount represents the period end market price of the commodity being hedged multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre tax fair value for futures, swaps, and options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre tax fair value for swaps represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract volumes. For futures and options, the pre tax fair value represents (i) the excess of the market value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or (ii) the excess of the contract amount over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the weighted average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the weighted average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The weighted average pay price and weighted average receive price for options represents their strike price. 55 Table of Contents December 31, 2009 Wtd Avg Wtd Avg Pre tax Contract Pay Receive

Contents INTEREST RATE RISK In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting certain fixed rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of the derivative instrument and debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December 31, 2009, we had commitments to purchase $456 million of U.S. dollars and commitments to sell $604 million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before February 1, 2010, resulting in a $3 million loss in the first quarter of 2010. 59 Table of Contents
