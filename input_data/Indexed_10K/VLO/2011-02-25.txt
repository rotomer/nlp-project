These results were primarily due to our refining segment operations, which generated operating income of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to operating income of $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in refining operating income was primarily due to improved margins for the distillate products we produce and wider sour crude oil differentials. The sour crude oil differential is the difference between the price of sweet crude oil and the price of sour crude oil. We believe that the improved distillate margins are due to an increase in the demand for refined products resulting from the improving U.S. and worldwide economies. Although improving, refined product demand has not returned to levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. Excess worldwide refinery capacity and high levels of refined product inventories continue to constrain refined product margins. In response to the worldwide economic slowdown, and as a result of our assessment of the operating performance and profitability of our refineries, we temporarily shut down our Aruba Refinery in July 2009 and p ermanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery in November 2009. In June 2010, we sold our shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets for $220 million of cash proceeds, and in December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and associated inventory for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one year note. Our Aruba Refinery remained idle throughout 2010, but in the third quarter of 2010, we began refinery wide maintenance to prepare the refinerys production units for restart due to improved sour crude oil differentials and a general improvement in refining economics. The Aruba Refinery resumed operations in January 2011. Our retail segment generated operating income of $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to operating income of $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 results benefited from the blending of ethanol into gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost results in an increase in retail fuel margins. During the latter part of 2010, the difference between the cost of gasoline and the cost of et hanol began to narrow and the benefit that our retail segment experienced through most of 2010 from the blending of ethanol into gasoline narrowed. Should this trend continue in 2011, our retail fuel margins may be negatively impacted as compared to 2010. In the second quarter of 2009, we entered the ethanol business through the acquisition of seven ethanol facilities, and we acquired three additional facilities in the first quarter of 2010. We believe that ethanol is a natural fit for us because we manufacture transportation fuels. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our ethanol segment generated operating in come of $209 million, compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and can be impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates. To support our financial strength and liquidity, we issued $1.25 b illion in debt during the first quarter of 2010 at interest rates favorable to those on our existing debt. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $484 million of debt with a higher interest rate, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. In December 2010, we received proceeds of $300 million under a financing agreement associated with the issuance of $300 million of Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds (GO Zone Bonds). In February 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which we expect to hold and reissue in future years to help fund the construction costs of a capital project at our St. Charles Refinery. & nbsp;25Table of ContentsWe expect the U.S. and worldwide economies to continue to recover slowly, and we expect refined product demand to increase. The increase in anticipated refined product demand is expected to result in an increase in crude oil production, which we believe will result in the production of more sour crude oils and continued improvement in sour crude oil differentials. The expected increases in refined product demand and sour crude oil production should favorably impact our refined product margins. However, we expect that the current excess global refining capacity will put pressure on refining margins and could result in ongoing production constraints or refinery shutdowns in the refining industry. We will continue to optimize our refining assets based on market conditions. 26Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b) During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). On June 1, 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP (PBF) for $220 million of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of $92 million ($58 million after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The ref ining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.(c) We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of those plants comme ncing on their respective acquisition or closing dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.(d) Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail&ndash;U.S. and Retail&ndash;Canada operating highlights 31Table of Contentshave been restated to reflect this reclassification.(e) The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as construction in progress as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(f) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throughput volumes.(g) Other produc ts primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(h) The refining regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilm ington Refineries.(i) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the Government of Aruba (GOA) regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. GeneralOperating revenues increased 27 percent (or $17.6 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below. RefiningOperating income for our refining segment increased from $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of $1.3 billion (discussed below), reduced asset impairment losses of $218 million, and the nonrecurrence of a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to p ermanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continue to evaluate our ongoing construction projects, but the number and significance of projects cancelled has substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba. The $1.3 billion improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increa se in throughput margin per barrel (an overall $1.80 per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but those improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below. Changes in the margin that we receive for our products have a material impact on our resul ts of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel, which is a type of distillate, was $11.14 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.12 per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 712,000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2010. Similarly, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was $7.92 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a negative margin of $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $9.23 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins 32Table of Contentswere higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports. The benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast Conventional 87 gasoline (Gulf Coast 87 gasoline) was $7.51 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.10 per barrel. CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a $1.87 per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.05 million barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2010. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2009. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $9.13 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2010. This compares to a discount of $5.19 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.94 per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed 844,000 barrels per day of sour crude oils. RetailRetail operating income wa s $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This 18 percent (or $53 million) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margins of $27 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in operating expenses. Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of Gulf Coast 87 gasoline for the year ended December 31, 2010, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended December 31, 2009. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for 2010 as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail op erations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent. Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above. 33Table of ContentsThe increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009. EthanolEthanol operating income was $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase of $44 million was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remed iation expenses. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $89 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to a pre tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008. Interest and debt expense increased $68 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase in interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume. We anticipate that significant construction activities will resume on certain construction projects in 2011. Income tax expense increased $618 million from a $43 million benefit in 2009 to $575 million of expense in 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes decreased $1.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the after tax loss of $1.2 billion related to the permanent shutdown of the Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Pauls boro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 34Table of Contents2009 Compared to 2008 Financial Highlights (a) (b) (c)(millions of dollars, except per share amounts)  Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 ChangeOperating revenues$64,599 $106,676 $(42,077)Costs and expenses: Cost of sales (d)58,686 96,087 (37,401)Operating expenses: Refining2,880 3,731 (851)Retail (d)626 676 (50)Ethanol169 &mdash;

The results of operations of the refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b) During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and Northeast Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. (c) We acquired seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented for 2009 includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective closing dates . Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during 2009 divided by actual calender days in 2009.(d) Credit card transactions processing fees incurred by our retail segment of $76 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have been reclassified from retail operating expenses to cost of sales. The Retail&ndash;U.S. and Retail&ndash;Canada operating highlights have been restated to reflect this reclassification.(e) The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as construction in progress as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(f) On July 1, 2008, we sold our Krotz Springs Refinery to Alon Refining Krotz Springs, Inc. (Alon). The nature and significance of our post closing participation in an offtake agreement with Alon represents a continuation of activities with the Krotz Springs Refinery for accounting purposes, and as such the results of operations related to the Krotz Springs Refinery have not been presented as discontinued operations. In addition, all refining operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Gulf Coast 39Table of Contentsregion, include the Krotz Springs Refinery for the year ended December 31, 2008. The pre tax gain of $305 million on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery is included in the Gulf Coast operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 but is excluded from the per barrel operating highlights.(g) During the fourth quarter of 2008, we determ ined that the goodwill in all four of our refining segment reporting units was impaired, which resulted in a pre tax and after tax goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion related to continuing operations. This goodwill impairment loss is included in the refining segment operating income but is excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008.(h) Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by throu ghput volumes.(i) Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(j) The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, Krotz Springs (for periods prior to its sale on July 1, 2008), St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid Continent refining region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region includes the Quebec City Refinery and the West Coast refining region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(k) A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel. GeneralOperating revenues decreased 39 percent (or $42.1 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income decreased by $448 million and income from continuing operations before taxes decreased by $600 million over the same period. These decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the U.S. and worldwide economic slowdown on the demand and prices for our refined products. The economic slowdown began in late 2008 and persisted throughout 2009. The decreases in operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes, however, were significantly affected by the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss and the $305 million gain on the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery that we recorded in 2008. Excluding these two items, operating income and income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, from the prior year. These decreases were primarily related to our refining segment, which experienced a $518 million decrea se in operating income in 2009 compared to 2008 (a $4.3 billion decrease after excluding the effect of the goodwill write off and other items) as discussed below. RefiningOperating income for our refining segment decreased from $765 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a decrease in operating results of $4.3 billion (discussed below), a reduced goodwill impairment loss of $4.0 billion, an increased asset impairment loss of $134 million, and an increased loss contingency accrual of $114 million. The goodwill impairment loss related to our determination in 2008 that our goodwill was impaired, which was based on the significant decline in our equity market capitalization. That decline was caused by severe disruptions in the U.S. and worldwide capital and commodities markets in 2008 and the resulting economic slowdown. The asset impairment loss of $220 million and $86 million reported in 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba. The $4.3 billion decrease in operating results was primarily due to a 46 perc ent decrease in throughput margin per barrel (a $5.16 per barrel decrease between the comparable years) and an 8 percent decrease in throughput volumes (an 186,000 barrel per day decrease between the comparable years). The decreases were primarily the result of the negative impact of the economic slowdown on the demand for and prices of refined products. The decrease in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant decrease in distillate margins, but 40Table of Contentsthe decrease in distillate margins was somewhat offset by an increase in gasoline margins in all of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel was also negatively impacted by narrow sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below. Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel was $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $22.96 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an unfavorable decrease of $14.94 per barrel. We experienced similar decreases in distillate margins in other regions. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins negatively impacted our overall refining margin by $4.4 billion, as we produced 692,000 barrels per day of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2009. The benchmark reference margin for Gulf Coast 87 gasoline was $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $4.85 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a favorable increase of $2.76 per barrel. CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins increased year over year to an even greater extent in the West Coast region (a $5.82 per barrel favorable increase). We estimate that the increase in gasoline margins had a $1.0 billion favorable impact t o our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.04 billion barrels per day of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2009. Gasoline margins were higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 despite a decrease in gasoline prices during 2009. We believe that the margins for gasoline improved due to a greater percentage decrease in the cost of crude oil as compared to the percentage decrease in the price of gasoline.In addition, the margins we received for other products, such as petroleum coke and sulfur, for the year ended December 31, 2009 improved by $2.1 billion as compared to 2008. We believe that the margins were higher in 2009 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oil in 2009 as compared to 2008. For example, the benchmark reference price of WTI crude oil was $61.69 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $99.56 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing a decrease of $37.87 per barrel. Because the prices for these other products are not significantly influenced by the cost of crude oil, changes in the cost of crude oil have a significant effect of the margins we receive for these products.For the year ended December 31, 2009, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was lower than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2008. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $5.19 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2009. This compared to a discount of $15.71 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2008, representing an unfavorable decrease of $10.52 per barrel. However, this narrower differential in 2009 was offset by a reduction of 174,000 barrels per day of sour crude oil that we processed during 2009 as compared to 2008, which resulted primarily from the temporary shutdown of our Aruba Refinery commencing in July 2009. We estimate that the narrower differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, negatively impacted our overall refining margin for 2009 by $2.6 billion as we processed 874,000 barrels per day of sour crude oils. Refining operating expenses were 23 percent lower (or $851 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $490 million in energy costs, a decrease of $171 million in maintenance expenses, a decrease of $48 million in sales and use taxes, and a decrease of $43 million resulting from no longer operating the Krotz Springs Refinery, which was sold in 2008. 41Table of ContentsRetailRetail operating income was $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $369 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This 21 percent decrease (or $76 million) was primarily due to decreased retail fuel margins of $124 million, offset by a $50 million decrease in operating expenses. The decrease in retail fuel margins was due to the effect of significantly higher margins in 2008. The hi gher margins in 2008 were caused by a decrease in the supply of fuel in connection with the temporary shutdown of refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Ike during the third quarter of 2008. Many of those refineries became operational by the fourth quarter of December 2008, and fuel supply and margins returned to normal levels. There were no similar events that occurred in 2009.The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a decrease in operating expenses due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2008. On average, Cdn.$1 was equal to $0.88 during 2009 compared to $0.95 during 2008, representing a decrease in value of seven percent. The weaker Canadian dollar had an $18 million favorable impact on the 2009 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operatio ns compared to 2008. EthanolEthanol operating income was $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which represents the operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not own or operate any ethanol plants prior to this acquisition. Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 mainly due to an increase of $39 million in litigation costs, an increase of $10 million in severance expenses, and acquisition costs of $10 million related to the acquisition of seven ethanol plants. These increases were partially offset by reductions of $29 million in environmental remediation expenses and $16 million in professional fees. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $96 million from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a $128 million unfavorable change in fair value adjustments related to the Alon earn out agreement and associated derivative instruments as discussed in Notes 20 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, reduced interest income of $37 million resulting from lower cash balances and interest rates, and a $14 million gain recognized in 2008 on the redemption of our 9.5% senior notes as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by a $55 milli on increase in the fair value of certain nonqualified benefit plan assets and $27 million of income resulting from the reversal of an accrual for potential payments related to a prior acquisition in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations. Interest and debt expense increased $56 million mainly due to interest incurred on $1.0 billion of notes issued in March 2009. Income tax expense decreased $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion of expense in 2008 to a $43 million benefit in 2009 mainly as a result of lower operating income in 2009 and the nondeductibility of a significant portion of the $4.0 billion goodwill impairment loss in 2008. Income (loss) from discontinued operat ions, net of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $1.7 billion from the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the $1.2 billion after tax loss on the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. 42Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in 2010. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of 2009. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.50% notes due in February 2015, $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $547 million of proceeds from the Paulsboro Refinery sale, $220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and $330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:&bull; fund $2.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; &bull; redeem our 7.5% senior notes for $294 million and our 6.75% senior notes for $190 million;&bull; make scheduled long term note repayments of $33 million;&bull; make net repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $100 million;&bull; pay common stock dividends of $114 million; &bull; purchase additional ethanol facilities for $260 million; and&bull; increase available cash on hand by $2.5 billion. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2009Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 billion compared to $3.1 billion for the year ende d December 31, 2008. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the $4.2 billion decrease in operating income discussed above under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, after excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment loss and gain on the sale of the Krotz Springs Refinery, both of which had no effect on cash flows from operating activities. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in the amount of income tax payments and refunds in 2008 and 2009 and a net $1.4 billion favorable eff ect from changes in receivables, inventories, and accounts payable between the two years. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2009 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2009 compared to such prices at the end of 2008. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2009, combined with $998 million of proceeds from the issuance of $1.0 billion of notes in March 2009 as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $799 million of net proceeds from the issuance of 46 million shares of common stock in June 2009 as discussed in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $100 million of additional proceeds from the sale of receivables, and $115 million of available cash on hand were used mainly to:&bull; fund $2.7 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;&bull; fund the acquisition of seven ethanol plants for $556 million;&bull; make scheduled long term note repayment s of $285 million; and&bull; pay common stock dividends of $324 million. 43Table of ContentsCash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statements of cash flows for all years presented and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008Cash provided by (used in) operating activities: Paulsboro Refinery$88 $10 $246 Delaware City Refinery(26) (126) 81 Cash used in investing activities: Paulsboro Refinery(41) (121) (212)Delaware City Refinery&mdash; (153) (268) Capital InvestmentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we expended $1.7 billion for capital expendi tures and $535 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $740 million of costs related to environmental projects. For 2011, we expect to incur approximately $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.4 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $260 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $510 million for deferred turnaround an d catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In January 2010, we acquired two ethanol plants and inventories for a total purchase price of $202 million. The plants are located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio. In February 2010, we acquired an additional ethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin plus certain receivables and inventories for a total consideration of $ 79 million. Of the $281 million of total consideration paid for these acquisitions, $21 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2009. On June 1, 2010, we sold the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to PBF for $220 million of cash proceeds, and on December 17, 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one year note secured by the Paulsboro Refinery. 44Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 are summarized below (in millions).

On February 1, 2011, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $210 million related to our 6.75% senior notes. On February 2, 2011, we paid $300 million to acquire the GO Zone Bonds, which were subject to mandatory tender on that date. We expect to hold the GO Zone Bonds for our own account until conditions permit the rema rketing of these bonds at an interest rate acceptable to us. We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third party entities and financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1.0 billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in June 2011. As of December 31, 2010, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we reduced the net eligible receivables sold under this program by $100 million. Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt. 45Table of ContentsOur agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Ratings Services, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2010, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: Rating AgencyRatingStandard & Poors Ratings ServicesBBB (negative outlook)Moodys Investors ServiceBaa2 (negative outlook )Fitch RatingsBBB (negative outlook) We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financings. Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined product and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchase d, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts included in the table above include both short term and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2010, our short term and long term purchase obligations increased by $6.4 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Other Long term LiabilitiesOur other long term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2010.  46Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2010, our committed lines of credit were as follows: BorrowingCapacityExpirationOutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facility$200 millionJune 2011$ Letter of credit facility$300 millionJune 2011$100 millionRevolving credit facility$2.4 billionNovember 2012$399 millionCanadian revolving credit facilityCdn. $115 millionDecember 2012Cdn. $20 milli on As of December 31, 2010, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2010 expire during 2011 and 2012. Stock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2010, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock. Pension Plan Funded StatusDuring 2010, we contributed $50 million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 5.40 percent discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2010, the fair value of the assets in our qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 95 percent of the projected benefit obligation under those plans as of the end of 2010. We have no minimum required contributions to our pension plans during 2011 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; however, we plan to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans during 2011. Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. While debate continues in the U.S. Congress regarding greenhouse gas legislation, the regulation of greenhouse gases at the federal level has now shifted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act). According to statements by the EPA, any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act and regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination will be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, wh ich could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. 47Table of ContentsIn addition, certain states have pursued independent regulation of greenhouse gases at the state level. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the CARB to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020. CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as a state wide cap and trade program. The LCFS is effective in 2011, with small reductions in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in California. The mandated reductions in carbon intensity are scheduled to increase through 2020, after which another step change in reductions is anticipated. The LCFS is designed to encourage substitution of traditional petroleum fuels, and, over time, it is anticipated that the LCFS will lead to a greater use of electric cars and alternative fuels, such as E85, as companies seek to generate more cre dits to offset petroleum fuels. The state wide cap and trade program will begin in 2012. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases (e.g., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions). Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by the program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will be significant, particularly beginning in 2015, when fuels are included in the program. Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap and trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. On June 30, 2010, the EPA formally disapproved the flexible permits program submitted by the TCEQ in 1994 for inclusion in its clean air implementation plan. The EPA determined that Texas flexible permit program did not meet several requirements under the federal Clean Air Act. Our Port Arthur, Texas City, Three Rivers, McKee and Corpus Christi East and West Refineries formerly operated under flexible permits administered by the TCEQ. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we completed the conversion of our flexible permits into federally enforc eable conventional state NSR permits (de flexed permits). We are now in the process of incorporating these de flexed permits into our Title V permits. Continued discussions with EPA regarding this matter are likely. Meanwhile, EPA has formally disapproved other TCEQ permitting programs that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process in Texas. For example, EPA has disapproved the TCEQ pollution control standard permit, thus requiring conventional permitting for future pollution control equipment. Litigation is pending from industry groups and others against EPA for each of these actions. EPA has also objected to numerous Title V permits in Texas and other states, including permits at our Port Arthur, Corpus Christi East, and McKee Refineries. Environmental activist groups have filed a notice of intent to sue EPA, seeking to require EPA to assume control of these permits from the TCEQ. All of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting. Because of this uncertainty, we are unable to determine the costs or effects of EPAs actions on our permitting activity. But EPAs disruption of the Texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Tax MattersAs discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to 48Table of Contentsour tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective June 1, 2010, the GOA enacted a new tax re gime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of 7 percent and a dividend withholding tax rate of 0 percent. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we will also make a minimum annual tax payment of $10 million (payable in equal quarterly installments) with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years. The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement that we entered into on February 24, 2010 with the GOA that established the terms for settlement of a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties. On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implement ed the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished the provisions of the previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of $118 million (primarily from restricted cash held in escrow) in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010. Financial Regulatory ReformOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new re gulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities. OtherOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers . These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private c apital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 49Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. Impairment of AssetsLong lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment evaluations and certain losses resulting from those evaluations. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES &ndash; Environmental Matters, could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws 50Table of Contentsand regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long term bonds that each receive one of the two highest ratings given by the recognized rating agencies as of the end of each year, while the expected return on pl an assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2011 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$70 $12 Compensation rate increase29 &mdash; Health care cost trend rate increase&mdash; 5 Increase in expense resulting from:  Discount rate decrease9 1 Expected return on plan assets decrease4 &mdash; Compensation rate increase6 &mdash; Health care cost t rend rate increase&mdash; 1 See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. 51Table of ContentsTax MattersOur operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities. Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of rele vant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our litigation matters. 52Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RI SK We are exposed to market risks related to the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our refining operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we enter into commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:&bull; inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year LIFO inventory levels differ from our previous year end LIFO inventory levels and &bull; forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to commodities that we perceive as opportunities to benefit our results of operations and cash flows, but for which there are no related physical transactions. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monito red and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2010 Gain (loss) in fair value due to: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(199) $&mdash; 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices189 (1) December 31, 2009 Gain (loss) in fair value due to: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(6) (8)10% decrease in underlying commodity prices6 &mdash; See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2010. 53Table of ContentsI NTEREST RATE RISK The following table provides information about our debt instruments (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
