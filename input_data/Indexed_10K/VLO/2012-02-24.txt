The improvement in net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to an increase in operating income of $1.8 billion attributable to the business segments outlined in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 ChangeOperating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $3,516 $1,903 $1,613Retail 381 346 35Ethanol 396 209 187Corporate (613) (582) (31)Total $3,680 $1,876 $1,804The increase of $1.6 billion in refining operating income was primarily due to the favorable difference between the price of sweet crude oils sourced from the inland U.S., such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), versus the price of benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent. Historically, the price of WTI type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils. Due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid Continent region, the increased supply of WTI type crude oil resulted in WTI type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils for most of 2011 as compared to 2010. Our McKee and Ardmore Refineries in the U.S. Mid Continent region process WTI type crude oils and significantly benefited from this favorable price difference.The increase of $35 million in retail operating income was primarily due to higher fuel margins and volumes in our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.The increase of $187 million in ethanol operating income was primarily due to improved operating margins combined with an increase in production volumes to an average of 3.4 million gallons per day. The ethanol business is dependent on margins between ethanol and corn feedstocks and is impacted by U.S. government subsidies and biofuels (including ethanol) mandates.On August 1, 2011, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Chevron Limited from a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and we subsequently changed the name of Chevron Limited to Valero Energy Ltd. Valero Energy Ltd owns and operates the Pembroke Refinery. Valero Energy Ltd also owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the U.K. and Ireland. On the acquisition date, we initially paid $1.8 billion from available cash, of which $1.1 billion was for working capital. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded an adjustment to working capital (primarily inventory), resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $1.7 billion. This acquisition is referred to as the Pembroke Acquisition.26Table of ContentsOn October 1, 2011, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets from Murphy Oil Corporation for an initial payment of $586 million, which was funded from available cash. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to $547 million. The benefit we experienced in our refining business for most of 2011 from processing discounted WTI type crude oils declined significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 as the premium of LLS and Brent crude oils versus WTI type crude oil narrowed considerably. In addition, our fourth quarter 2011 results reflected a significant decline in margins for most of the products we produce. Product margins have since improved in early 2012, but we expect the energy markets and margins to be volatile. The U.S. and worldwide refining business continues to experience capacity rationalization, particularly in Europe, the U.S. East Coast, and the Caribbean, where declining product margins have negatively impacted refineries in those regions. In particular, our Aruba Refinery has been negatively impacted. We restarted the Aruba Refinery in January 2011 after shutting it down temporarily in July 2009, but the refinery has not yet generated positive cash flows on a sustained basis. We are exploring strategic alternatives for the refinery, including alternative feedstocks, configuration changes, and a temporary or permanent shutdown of the refinery facilities. We expect to conclude our evaluation of these strategic alternatives in the first quarter of 2012. A decision to temporarily or permanently shut down the refinery or a revision to the future operating plans for the refinery that results in a decrease in future expected cash flows could result in the refinery being impaired. The Aruba Refinery had a net book value of $958 million as of December 31, 2011; therefore, an impairment loss would be material to our results of operations.As of the date of the filing of this report, the financial markets continue to experience significant volatility and the overall impact on our business is uncertain at this time.27Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations.

on pages 28 through 32.(a)The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and U.S. Gulf Coast region include the results of operations of our Meraux Refinery, including related logistics assets, from the date of its acquisition on October 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (b)The financial highlights and operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region include the results of operations of our Pembroke Refinery, including the related market and logistics business from the date of its acquisition on August 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (c)In 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery and our shutdown Delaware City refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of these refineries have been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the operating highlights for the refining segment and North Atlantic region exclude these refineries for the year ended December 31, 2010.(d)We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, Port Arthur, and Meraux Refineries; the U.S. Mid Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic (formerly known as Northeast) region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(h)Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS crude oil and other types of crude oil, have been included in the table of Average Market Reference Prices and Differentials. The table also includes price differentials by region between the prices of certain products and the benchmark crude oil that provides the best indicator of product margins for each region. Prior to the first quarter of 2011, feedstock and product differentials were based on the price of WTI crude oil. However, the price of WTI crude oil no longer provides a reasonable benchmark price of crude oil for all regions. Beginning in late 2010, WTI crude oil began to price at a discount to benchmark sweet crude oils, such as LLS and Brent, because of increased WTI supplies resulting from greater U.S. production and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid Continent region. Therefore, the use of the price of WTI crude oil as a benchmark price for regions that do not process WTI crude oil is no longer reasonable.GeneralOperating revenues increased 53 percent (or $43.8 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices and higher throughput volumes between the two years related to our refining segment operations. The higher throughput volumes resulted primarily from the incremental throughput of 33,000 BPD1 ($1.3 billion of revenue) from the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, incremental throughput of 109,000 BPD1 ($7.5 billion of revenue) from the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011, and incremental throughput of 145,000 BPD ($4.9 billion of revenue) from the Aruba Refinery, which restarted operations in January 2011. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to a $1.6 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below. 1Calculated based on throughput volumes of the Meraux Refinery and the Pembroke Refinery from the date of their respective acquisitions (October 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011), divided by the number of days during the year ended December 31, 2011.33Table of ContentsRefiningRefining segment operating income nearly doubled from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The $1.6 billion improvement in operating income was due to a $2.2 billion increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $462 million increase in operating expenses.The $2.2 billion increase in refining margin was primarily due to a 19 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (a $1.50 per barrel increase between the years). This increase in refining margin was largely driven by an improvement in the U.S. Mid Continent region, which experienced an increase in its throughput margin per barrel of $7.77. The U.S. Mid Continent throughput margin per barrel of $15.10 for the year ended December 31, 2011 was more than double the throughput margin per barrel of $7.33 for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was due to the substantial discount in the price of WTI type crude oil, the primary type of crude oil processed by our U.S. Mid Continent refineries, versus the price of LLS and Brent crude oils. Historically, the price of WTI type crude oil has closely approximated LLS and Brent crude oils, but due to the significant development of crude oil reserves within the U.S. Mid Continent region and increased deliveries of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. Mid Continent region, the increased supply of WTI type crude oil resulted in WTI type crude oil being priced at a significant discount to LLS and Brent crude oils during 2011. For example, the WTI based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid Continent conventional 87 gasoline was $22.37 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $8.20 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $14.17 per barrel. In addition, the WTI based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid Continent ultra low sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $31.06 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $11.91 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a favorable increase of $19.15 per barrel. We estimate that these increases in gasoline and distillate margins per barrel had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, year over year. The increase of $462 million in operating expenses discussed above was partially due to $42 million in operating expenses of the Meraux Refinery, which was acquired on October 1, 2011, and $141 million in operating expenses of the Pembroke Refinery, which was acquired on August 1, 2011. The remaining increase of $279 million was due to a $107 million increase in chemicals and catalyst costs, an $86 million increase in employee related expenses, and a $75 million increase in reliability expenses.RetailRetail operating income was $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This 10 percent (or $35 million) increase was primarily due to increases in fuel margins of $43 million primarily from our Canadian operations, including a favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, and an increase in merchandise margins of $15 million, offset by increased operating expenses of $24 million.EthanolEthanol segment operating income was $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase of $187 million was primarily due to a $226 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $36 million increase in operating expenses.Gross margin increased from the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to an increase in ethanol production (a 331,000 gallon per day increase between the years) primarily resulting from the full operation of three additional plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010 and higher utilization rates and increased yields during 2011 combined with a $0.13 per gallon increase in the ethanol gross margin.34Table of ContentsThe increase in operating expenses was primarily due to $27 million of additional expenses related to the three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010. We operated these plants for all of 2011 compared to part of 2010.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses increased $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a $25 million increase in variable compensation expense, $27 million in costs incurred in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition, and a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which reduced general and administrative expenses in 2010. These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by favorable legal settlements of $47 million in 2011.Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $63 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due to a pre tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company (CHOPS) recognized in November 2010 and the $16 million effect of earnings on our interest in CHOPS recognized in 2010.Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $83 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease is primarily due to an increase of $62 million in capitalized interest related to an increase in capital expenditures between the years and the resumption of construction activity on previously suspended projects combined with a $19 million favorable impact from the decrease in average borrowings.Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $651 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2011 and a one time $20 million income tax benefit recognized in 2010 related to a tax settlement with the Government of Aruba (GOA).The loss from discontinued operations of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to adjustments to the working capital settlement related to the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery in December 2010. The loss from discontinued operations of $599 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 represents a $47 million after tax loss from the discontinued operations of the Delaware City and Paulsboro Refineries and a $610 million after tax loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, partially offset by a $58 million after tax gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets at Delaware

pages 36 through 40.(a)In December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC for $547 million of cash proceeds and a $160 million one year note, resulting in a pre tax loss on the sale of $980 million ($610 million after taxes). The results of operations of the refinery, including the loss on the sale, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Paulsboro Refinery for both years presented.(b)During the fourth quarter of 2009, we permanently shut down our Delaware City Refinery and wrote down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value, resulting in a pre tax loss on the shutdown of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after taxes). In June 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP for $220 million of cash proceeds, resulting in a pre tax gain on the sale of the refinery assets of $92 million ($58 million after taxes) and an insignificant gain on the sale of the terminal and pipeline assets. The results of operations of the shutdown refinery, including the gain on the sale in 2010 and the loss on the shutdown in 2009, have been presented as discontinued operations for both years presented. The refining segment and North Atlantic Region operating highlights exclude the Delaware City Refinery for both years presented. The terminal and pipeline assets associated with the refinery were not shut down in 2009 and continued to be operated until they were sold; the results of these operations are reflected in continuing operations for both years presented.(c)We acquired three ethanol plants in the first quarter of 2010 and seven ethanol plants in the second quarter of 2009. The information presented includes the results of operations of these plants commencing on their respective acquisition dates. Ethanol production volumes are based on total production during each year divided by actual calendar days per year. (d)The asset impairment loss relates primarily to the permanent cancellation of certain capital projects classified as construction in progress as a result of the unfavorable impact of the economic slowdown on refining industry fundamentals. The asset impairment loss amounts are included in the refining segment operating income but are excluded from the regional operating income amounts and the consolidated and regional operating costs per barrel.(e)Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.(f)Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.(g)The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the U.S. Mid Continent region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Quebec City Refinery; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.(h)A loss contingency accrual of $140 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to our dispute with the GOA regarding a turnover tax on export sales as well as other tax matters. The portion of the loss contingency accrual that relates to the turnover tax was recorded in cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore is included in refining operating income (loss) but has been excluded in determining throughput margin per barrel.GeneralOperating revenues increased 27 percent (or $17.6 billion) for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of higher average refined product prices between the two years. Operating income increased $1.8 billion and income from continuing operations before taxes also increased $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the amounts reported for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income discussed below.RefiningOperating income for our refining segment increased from $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an overall improvement in operating results of $1.3 billion (discussed below), reduced asset impairment loss of $218 million, and the nonrecurrence of a $114 million loss contingency accrual in 2009. The asset impairment loss recorded in 2009 related to our decision to permanently cancel certain construction projects in response to the economic slowdown that began in 2008. We continued to evaluate our ongoing construction projects during 2009 and 2010, but the number and significance of projects cancelled substantially declined in 2010. The loss contingency accrual recorded in 2009 related to our dispute of a turnover tax on export sales in Aruba.41Table of ContentsThe $1.3 billion improvement in operating results was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in throughput margin per barrel (an overall $1.80 per barrel increase between the comparable years). The increase in throughput margin per barrel was caused by a significant improvement in distillate margins and petrochemical (primarily propylene) margins, but these improvements were somewhat offset by a decline in gasoline margins in two of our refining regions. Throughput margin per barrel also benefited from wider sour crude oil differentials. The impact of these factors on our throughput margin per barrel is described below.Changes in the margin we receive for our products have a material impact on our results of operations. For example, the WTI based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel was $11.14 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $8.02 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.12 per barrel. Similar increases in distillate margins were experienced in other regions. We estimate that the increase in margin for distillates had an $820 million positive impact on our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 712,000 BPD of distillates during the year ended December 31, 2010. Similarly, the WTI based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast propylene was $7.92 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a negative margin of $1.31 for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $9.23 per barrel. We estimate that the increase in margin for petrochemicals (primarily propylene) had a $199 million positive impact on our refining margin, year over year. Distillate and propylene margins were higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to an increase in the industrial demand for these products resulting from the ongoing recovery of the U.S. and worldwide economies and exports. The WTI based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline was $7.51 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $7.61 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.10 per barrel. The WTI based CARBOB 87 gasoline benchmark reference margins decreased year over year to an even greater extent in the U.S. West Coast region (a $1.87 per barrel unfavorable decrease). We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins had a $119 million negative impact to our overall refining margin, year over year, as we produced 1.05 million BPD of gasoline during the year ended December 31, 2010. Gasoline margins were lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 despite an increase in gasoline prices during 2010. We believe that the margins for gasoline were constrained due to continued weak consumer demand and high levels of inventory. In addition, our downstream customers increased the use of ethanol as a component in transportation fuels because its price was lower than the price of gasoline.For the year ended December 31, 2010, the differential applicable to the price of sour crude oil as compared to the price of sweet crude oil was wider than the differential for the year ended December 31, 2009. For example, Maya crude oil, which is a type of sour crude oil, sold at a discount of $9.13 per barrel to WTI crude oil, a type of sweet crude oil, during the year ended December 31, 2010. This compared to a discount of $5.19 per barrel during the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a favorable increase of $3.94 per barrel. The benefit of this wider differential, however, was offset by a reduction of 30,000 BPD of sour crude oil that we processed during 2010 as compared to 2009. We estimate that the wider differentials for all types of sour crude oil that we process, offset by reduced throughput volumes, had a $196 million positive impact to our overall refining margin for 2010 as we processed 844,000 BPD of sour crude oils.42Table of ContentsRetailRetail operating income was $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This 18 percent (or $53 million) increase was primarily due to increases in retail fuel margins of $57 million and merchandise margin of $27 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in operating expenses.Retail fuel margins are affected by the blending of ethanol with the gasoline sold by our retail segment. For most of 2010, ethanol was a lower cost product than gasoline and this lower cost resulted in an increase in retail fuel margins. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) price for a gallon of ethanol was $0.23 less than a gallon of U.S. Gulf Coast conventional 87 gasoline for the year ended December 31, 2010, but there was little difference between the prices of these products for the year ended December 31, 2009. We estimate that the lower cost of ethanol had a $32 million positive impact to our U.S. retail fuel margins for 2010 as approximately 80 percent of the gasoline we sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 contained 10 percent ethanol. Retail fuel margins in our Canadian retail operations increased by $27 million due to the favorable impact from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. On average, Cdn$1 was equal to $0.96 during 2010 compared to $0.88 in 2009, representing an increase in value of nine percent.Retail merchandise margins increased due to increased product pricing combined with improved product mix, and a favorable impact from the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009, as described above.The increase in operating expenses was also due to the stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar had a $21 million unfavorable impact on the 2010 operating expenses of our Canadian retail operations compared to 2009. EthanolEthanol operating income was $209 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase of $44 million was primarily due to a full year of operations of the seven ethanol plants acquired in the second quarter of 2009 and the addition of three ethanol plants acquired in the first quarter of 2010, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate Expenses and OtherGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a favorable settlement with an insurance company for $40 million recorded in 2010, which offset an increase in litigation costs of $40 million recorded in 2009. After adjusting for these items, the $40 million increase in general and administrative expenses year over year resulted from an increase of $21 million for incentive compensation expenses and an increase of $18 million for environmental remediation expenses. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $89 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 due to a pre tax gain of $55 million related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS in November 2010 and the effect of a $42 million loss in 2009 on changes in the fair values of an earn out agreement and associated derivative instruments that were entered into in connection with the sale of our Krotz Springs Refinery in 2008.Interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest increased $68 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is composed of a $53 million increase 43Table of Contentsin interest incurred on $1.25 billion of debt issued in February 2010 and $1.0 billion of debt issued in March 2009 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and a $15 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in capital expenditures between the years and the temporary suspension of activity on certain construction projects. We do not capitalize interest with respect to suspended construction projects until significant construction activities resume. Income tax expense increased $618 million from a $43 million benefit in 2009 to $575 million of expense in 2010 mainly as a result of higher operating income in 2010.Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes decreased $1.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the after tax loss of $1.2 billion related to the permanent shut down of our Delaware City Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2009. The results of operations for the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries, including the loss and gain, respectively, on their sales, are reflected in Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $4.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the $1.8 billion increase in operating income discussed above under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2011 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2011 compared to such prices at the end of 2010.The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 combined with $150 million of proceeds from the sale of receivables and $2.3 billion from available cash on hand was used mainly to:fund $3.0 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; purchase the Pembroke Refinery and the related marketing and logistics business for $1.7 billion;purchase the Meraux Refinery for $547 million;redeem our Series 1997B 5.4% and Series 1997C 5.4% industrial revenue bonds for $56 million;make scheduled long term note repayments of $418 million;acquire the Gulf Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds Series 2010 (GO Zone Bonds) for $300 million;purchase our common stock for $349 million; andpay common stock dividends of $169 million.Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was due primarily to the receipt of a $923 million tax refund in 2010. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2010 due to significant increases in prices for gasoline, distillate, and crude oil at the end of 2010 compared to such prices at the end of 2009.44Table of ContentsThe net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010, combined with $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.5% notes due in February 2015, $850 million of 6.125% notes due in February 2020, and $300 million of GO Zone Bonds as discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, $547 million of proceeds from the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, $220 million of proceeds from the sale of the shutdown Delaware City Refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets, and $330 million of proceeds from the sale of our 50 percent interest in CHOPS as discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, were used mainly to:fund $2.3 billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs; redeem our 7.5% senior notes for $294 million and our 6.75% senior notes for $190 million;make scheduled long term note repayments of $33 million;make net repayments under our accounts receivable sales facility of $100 million;pay common stock dividends of $114 million;purchase additional ethanol facilities for $260 million; andincrease available cash on hand by $2.5 billion.Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Paulsboro and Delaware City Refineries have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are summarized as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009Cash provided by (used in)operating activities: Paulsboro Refinery$ $88 $10Delaware City Refinery (26) (126)Cash used in investing activities: Paulsboro Refinery (41) (121)Delaware City Refinery (153)Capital InvestmentsOur operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units, and the cost of these improvements is significant. We have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. As such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.We make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. Reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. Improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process higher volumes of sour crude oil, which lowers our feedstock costs, and enables us to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. Therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity 45Table of Contentssignificantly.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we expended $2.4 billion for capital expenditures and $629 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $241 million of costs related to environmental projects.For 2012, we expect to incur approximately $3.4 billion for capital investments, including approximately $2.8 billion for capital expenditures (approximately $140 million of which is for environmental projects) and approximately $560 million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. The capital expenditure estimate excludes expenditures related to future strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are summarized below (in millions).

We amended our agreement in June 2011 to extend the maturity date to June 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $250 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we sold $150 million of eligible receivables under this program and made no repayments. All amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.46Table of ContentsOur agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings by S&P, Moodys and Fitch, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. As of December 31, 2011, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:Rating Agency RatingStandard & Poors Ratings Services BBB (stable outlook)Moodys Investors Service Baa2 (stable outlook)Fitch Ratings BBB (stable outlook)We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing and the cost of such financings.Operating Lease ObligationsOur operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases. Purchase ObligationsA purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short and long term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2011, our short and long term purchase obligations increased by approximately $6 billion from the amount reported as of December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010.Other Long term LiabilitiesOur other long term liabilities are described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long term liabilities in the table above, we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of December 31, 2011.47Table of ContentsOther Commercial CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2011, our committed lines of credit were as follows (in millions): BorrowingCapacity Expiration OutstandingLetters of CreditLetter of credit facilities $500 June 2012 $300U.S. revolving credit facility $3,000 December 2016 $119Canadian revolving credit facility C$115 December 2012 C$20As of December 31, 2011, we had no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities. The letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2011 expire during 2012 and 2013.Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital ResourcesStock Purchase ProgramsAs of December 31, 2011, we have approvals under common stock purchase programs previously approved by our board of directors to purchase approximately $3.5 billion of our common stock.Pension Plan Funded StatusDuring 2011, we contributed $204 million to our pension plans that have minimum funding requirements. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the assets of these plans was approximately 88 percent of the projected benefit obligations under these plans.We have minimum required contributions of $2 million to these pension plans during 2012; however, we plan to contribute approximately $100 million to our pension plans during 2012.Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters. Tax MattersWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax matters. 48Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Cash Held by Our International SubsidiariesWe operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of December 31, 2011, $822 million of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.Financial Regulatory ReformIn July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act). The Wall Street Reform Act, among many things, creates new regulations for companies that extend credit to consumers and requires most derivative instruments to be traded on exchanges and routed through clearinghouses. Rules to implement the Wall Street Reform Act are being finalized and therefore, the impact to our operations is not yet known. However, implementation could result in higher margin requirements, higher clearing costs, and more reporting requirements with respect to our derivative activities.Concentration of CustomersOur refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.Sources of LiquidityWe believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.49Table of ContentsNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAs discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements have been issued that either have already been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, or will become effective for our financial statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates are reasonable.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe cost of property, plant and equipment (property assets) purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, are capitalized. The cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets, however, is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which either extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (Units), and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.Depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that groups estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.50Table of ContentsAlso under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset (net of salvage value) that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset (primarily involuntary conversions). Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.Impairment of AssetsLong lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalyst costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. In order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable. Providing sensitivity analyses if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our asset impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from those analyses.We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20 year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes.51Table of ContentsThe amount of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit ObligationsWe have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside our control. For example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long term bonds that have an average rating of double A when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. For example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2012 (in millions): Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefitsIncrease in projected benefit obligation resulting from: Discount rate decrease$85 $13Compensation rate increase33 Health care cost trend rate increase 5 Increase in expense resulting from: Discount rate decrease14 1Expected return on plan assets decrease4 Compensation rate increase8 Health care cost trend rate increase 1See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.Tax MattersWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, transactional taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, and value added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters. Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts.We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. Actual tax liabilities can vary from our 52Table of Contentsestimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible outcomes. See Notes 12 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.Legal MattersA variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.53Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to hedge:inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year end LIFO inventory levels and forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of these forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions): Derivative Instruments Held For Non Trading Purposes TradingPurposesDecember 31, 2011 Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices$(156) $110% decrease in underlying commodity prices156 2 December 31, 2010 Gain (loss) in fair value resulting from: 10% increase in underlying commodity prices(199) 10% decrease in underlying commodity prices189 (1)See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011.54Table of ContentsCOMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISKWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of financial instruments associated withvarious governmental and regulatory compliance programs that we must purchase in the open market to comply with these programs. To reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows, we may enter into derivative instruments, such as futures. As of December 31, 2011, there was no significant gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the futures contracts. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs and notional volumes associated with these derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011. INTEREST RATE RISKThe following table provides information about our debt instruments, excluding capital lease obligations (dollars in millions), the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
