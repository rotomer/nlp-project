Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below, we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment; impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill; reclamation costs; pension and other postretirement benefits; environmental compliance; claims and litigation including self insurance; and income taxes. Although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty We are involved in several class action and complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals business. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency. Furthermore, unfavorable results in one or more of these actions could result in an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For a description of our current legal proceedings see Note 12 Other Commitments and Contingencies in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to drive the U.S. economy. We are the nations largest producer of construction aggregates primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel a major producer of asphalt mix and concrete and a leading producer of cement in Florida. Segments Our four operating segments are organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt mix, concrete and cement. For reporting purposes, we have combined our Asphalt mix and Concrete segments into one reporting segment as the products are similar in nature and the businesses exhibit similar economic characteristics, product processes, types and classes of customer, methods of distribution and regulatory environments. Management reviews earnings for the product line reporting units principally at the gross profit level. Our Aggregates segment mines, processes, distributes and sells crushed stone, sand and gravel. Our Asphalt mix and Concrete segment produces and sells asphalt mix, ready mixed concrete, concrete block, prestressed concrete beams 18 Table of Contents and precast concrete, and sells other building materials. Our Cement segment mines limestone feedstock and produces and sells Portland cement and masonry cement. It also imports, grinds, blends and sells cement and slag, and produces and sells calcium products. Products We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product aggregates is consumed in virtually all types of publicly and privately funded construction. During 2008, we shipped 204.3 million tons into 23 states, the District of Columbia, the Bahamas, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Chile and Mexico from 331 aggregates production facilities and sales yards. Our ten largest states, measured by our aggregates shipments, accounted for 82% of our total aggregates shipments. Reserves largely determine the ongoing viability of an aggregates business. Our current estimate of 13.3 billion tons of zoned and permitted aggregates reserves represents a net increase of 5.0 billion tons since the end of 1998. We believe that these reserves are sufficient to last, on average, 51.7 years at current annual production rates. While aggregates are our primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns. As such, we evaluate the structural characteristics of individual markets to determine the appropriateness of an aggregates only or vertical integration strategy. For a discussion of End Markets, Competition and Customers, and Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Our Business, see Item 1 Business above. Other On November 16, 2007, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Florida Rock Industries, Inc. (Florida Rock), a leading producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete products in the southeastern and mid Atlantic states, in exchange for cash and stock of approximately $4.2 billion based on the closing price of Vulcan common stock on November 15, 2007. The acquisition further diversified the geographic scope of Vulcans operations, expanding our presence in attractive Florida markets and in other high growth southeastern and mid Atlantic states, and adding approximately 1.6 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves and 0.1 billion tons of proven and probable cement and calcium carbonate reserves in many markets where reserves are increasingly scarce. In June 2005, we sold our Chemicals business as presented in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, its results are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In the discussion that follows, continuing operations consist of our Construction Materials business, which is organized into three reportable segments: Aggregates; Asphalt mix and Concrete; and Cement. The results of operations discussed below include Florida Rock for the periods from November 16, 2007 through December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008. Discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business, are discussed separately. In the comparative analysis, segment revenue at the product line level includes intersegment sales. Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which management reviews results of operations. Results of Operations 2008 versus 2007 The financial and economic turmoil in the U.S. is unprecedented and the external factors affecting the construction industry continue to present unique challenges for our business. Aggregates demand and our shipments have declined for three consecutive years. Our legacy aggregates shipments in 2008 were down 30% from the peak level achieved in 2005. Throughout 2008, we focused aggressively on controlling costs while realizing higher pricing for our products reflecting their value in the attractive markets we serve. We reduced our operating costs by limiting operating hours, streamlining our work force, and focusing on production efficiencies in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products. As a result of these actions, the cash earnings per ton of aggregates in our legacy operations increased over 50% from the 2005 level, which was a year of peak demand for aggregates. The cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in 2008 was higher than in any other period in our history. The 19 Table of Contents increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover. Net sales for 2008 of $3.5 billion reflected an increase of 12% from the prior year. This increase resulted from the inclusion of the former Florida Rock operations for the full year. Volumes were adversely affected by the continuing sharp downturn in construction activity. Pricing for our products remained strong and helped offset the earnings effects of lower volumes, higher energy related costs, increased interest expense, as well as higher noncash charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. The unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased 36% and 69%, respectively, from 2007 in our legacy operations. Net loss per diluted share was $0.04 in 2008 compared with net earnings of $4.54 per diluted share in 2007. The 2008 results include an estimated $227.6 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, after tax goodwill impairment charge referable to our Cement segment in Florida. The 2008 results also include net earnings per diluted share of $0.34 referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. Results in 2007 include net earnings per diluted share of $0.24 referable to the sale of real estate in California, net of the related incentives. Additionally, the higher energy related costs lowered earnings per diluted share $0.86 compared with 2007. Aggregates segment revenues decreased $41.4 million to $2,406.8 million compared with 2007, as the effect of lower volumes from legacy operations more than offset the effect of improved pricing and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the former Florida Rock aggregates operations. Compared with 2007, total aggregates shipments declined 12% while the average selling price increased 7%. Most of our geographic markets reported double digit percentage declines in aggregates volumes except for markets in Texas and along the Central Gulf Coast. Gross profit for the Aggregates segment of $657.6 million declined 21% from 2007 as the earnings effects from the decline in legacy Vulcan shipments and sharply higher unit cost for diesel fuel more than offset the improvement in aggregates pricing and the inclusion of earnings from the former Florida Rock operations. Asphalt mix and Concrete segment revenues increased $435.3 million to $1,201.2 million compared with 2007. Shipments of asphalt mix declined 9% in 2008 while concrete shipments increased significantly due to inclusion of a full year of sales from the former Florida Rock concrete operations. Asphalt mix prices increased 15% from 2007 while the unit cost of liquid asphalt rose 69%. Asphalt mix earnings decreased due principally to higher costs for liquid asphalt. Compared with 2007, gross profit for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment decreased 39% to $74.4 million in 2008. Revenues and gross profit for the Cement segment were $106.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively. The Cement segment was acquired in November 2007 as part of the Florida Rock acquisition, and therefore, no comparable revenues or earnings were reported for the first 10 months of 2007. Selling, administrative and general expenses increased $53.0 million from 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses related to the former Florida Rock businesses, $10.5 million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property and $6.7 million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions. During 2008, we recorded an estimated $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our cement operations in Florida, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit. There were no comparable charges in 2007. During 2008, we recorded a $73.8 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. During 2007, we recorded a $43.8 million pretax gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of real estate in California. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $75.1 million, a decrease of $592.4 million from the prior year. In addition to the items noted above, higher interest expense contributed to this decrease in earnings. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased $128.1 million due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of Florida Rock. 20 Table of Contents Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for 2008 versus 2007 are summarized below (in millions of dollars): 2007 $ 668 Lower aggregates earnings due to Lower volumes (210 ) Higher selling prices 115 Higher costs (76 ) Lower asphalt mix and concrete earnings (48 ) Higher cement earnings 18 Higher selling, administrative and general expenses (53 ) Goodwill impairment cement (estimated) (253 ) Gain on divestitures 74 Gain on 2007 sale of California real estate (44 ) Higher interest expense, net (128 ) All other 12 2008 $ 75 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations decreased to ($0.02) per diluted share in 2008 from $4.66 per diluted share in 2007. The goodwill impairment charge accounted for $2.07 per diluted share of the decline. 2007 versus 2006 Consolidated net sales increased 2% from the prior year to a record $3.1 billion. Continued strong growth in aggregates pricing during 2007 contributed to an increase in operating earnings year over year despite lower sales volumes across all principal product lines. The pricing momentum achieved in 2005 and 2006 continued in 2007, reflecting an environment that recognizes the high cost of replacing aggregates reserves in high growth metropolitan markets. Aggregates segment revenues were $2,448.2 million in 2007, an increase of 2% from $2,405.5 in the prior year. Excluding the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition, revenues for Vulcans legacy Aggregates segment declined slightly as lower shipments were substantially offset by a 13% increase in average selling prices. Aggregates shipments during 2007 decreased approximately 9% from 2006 levels, primarily as a result of lower demand in the residential construction market. The impact of residential construction activity on shipments was partially offset by increased levels of highway construction and nonresidential building construction. Gross profit for the Aggregates segment increased $9.7 million, or 1%, over 2006. Unit costs for aggregates produced at legacy Vulcan operations increased in 2007 due principally to the effects of higher depreciation expense referable to recently completed capital projects coupled with a 10% reduction in production volumes. Additionally, unit costs for energy, such as diesel fuel and electric power, increased by approximately 7%. Higher costs for diesel fuel lowered gross profit from legacy Vulcan aggregates operations approximately $12 million. Revenues for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment increased slightly to $765.9 million in 2007 as compared to $760.9 million in 2006. Excluding the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition, revenues for Vulcans legacy Asphalt mix and Concrete segment decreased by $60.5 million, or 8%. Revenues for asphalt mix improved due to higher pricing, which more than offset a 9% decline in volumes. Concrete pricing improved 7%, but was more than offset by a 30% decline in volumes. Gross profit for the Asphalt mix and Concrete segment was mixed, with asphalt mix improving and concrete declining. Higher pricing for asphalt mix more than offset the lower volumes and higher prices for aggregates supplied internally. Unit costs for liquid asphalt remained at high levels in 2007 with little change when compared with the prior year. Higher pricing for concrete was more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs, including aggregates supplied internally. Revenues and gross profit for the Cement segment, all of which was acquired in the Florida Rock transaction, were immaterial to 2007 results of operations. Operating earnings improved to $714.4 million, a 2.8% increase over 2006. The increase in operating earnings was due to the aforementioned higher pricing for each of our principal products and a $43.8 million gain on sale of real estate in California during the first quarter of 2007. Prior year results include a $24.8 million gain referable to the 21 Table of Contents sale of contractual rights to mine a quarry in Atlanta, Georgia. These favorable contributions to operating earnings more than offset the effects of lower production levels, an increase in energy costs and Florida Rock transaction and integration related costs. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $667.5 million, a decrease of $36.0 million from the prior year. The 2006 earnings include a pretax gain of $28.7 million related to the increase in the carrying value of the contingent ECU (electrochemical unit) earn out received in connection with the sale of our Chemicals business. The 2007 corresponding pretax gain from the ECU earn out was $1.9 million. An increase of $21.9 million in interest expense also contributed to the decline in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for 2007 versus 2006 are summarized below (in millions of dollars): 2006 $ 703 Legacy Vulcan operations Higher aggregates earnings 7 Higher asphalt mix and concrete earnings 7 Higher selling, administrative and general expenses (13 ) Gain on sale of California real estate 44 Gain on 2006 sale of contractual rights to mine (25 ) Lower gain on contingent ECU earn out (27 ) All other Legacy 4 Florida Rock acquisition (32 ) 2007 $ 668 Earnings from continuing operations decreased to $4.66 per diluted share from $4.81 per diluted share in 2006. Earnings per share in 2007 include the effects of the Florida Rock acquisition, including operating results, interest expense associated with the financing of the transaction, additional shares issued as part of the transaction, one time expenses associated with executing the transaction and integrating the businesses, and depreciation associated with the write up of assets to fair value in accordance with purchase accounting. Specifically, 2007 diluted earnings per share include approximately $0.13 per share due to one time transaction related items, $0.12 per share related to higher interest expense attributable to the additional debt incurred to fund the transaction, and $0.07 per share due to the effect of additional shares issued as purchase consideration in the transaction. Selling, Administrative and General Selling, administrative and general expenses were $342.6 million in 2008 as compared with $289.6 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to the following: including a full year of expenses related to the former Florida Rock businesses; $10.5 million of expense related to the fair market value of donated property (a partially offsetting amount is recorded in gain on sale of property, plant equipment and businesses, net as noted below); and $6.7 million related to the replacement of legacy information technology systems and the related consolidation of certain administrative support functions. Excluding the effects of the aforementioned items, selling, administrative and general expenses decreased approximately $30.0 million or 11% compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of lower performance based compensation. Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of net sales were 9.9% in 2008, up from the prior years 9.4%. In 2007, selling, administrative and general expenses increased $25.3 million or 9.6% from the 2006 level. This increase was partially attributable to selling, administrative and general expenses associated with the newly acquired Florida Rock operations as well as transaction and integration related costs. Excluding the effects of Florida Rock, during 2007 selling, administrative and general expenses increased approximately 5% over the 2006 level. Goodwill Impairment During 2008, we recorded an estimated $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our Cement segment in Florida, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit. These operations were acquired as part of the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007. There were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2007 and 2006. For additional details regarding this impairment, see the Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Critical Accounting Policy below. 22 Table of Contents Gain on Sale of Property, Plant Equipment and Businesses, Net During 2008, we recorded gains on the sale of property, plant equipment and businesses of $94.2 million, an increase of $35.5 million from the prior year. Included in the 2008 gains was the aforementioned $73.8 million pretax gain referable to the sale of quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. Also included was $10.4 million of gain related to the fair market value of donated property. During 2007, we recorded gains on the sale of property, plant equipment and businesses of $58.7 million, an increase of $53.1 million from 2006. Included in the 2007 gains was a $43.8 million pretax gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of real estate in California. As none of these asset sales met the definition of a component of an entity as defined in SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets (FAS 144), the gains were reported in continuing operations. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net Other operating income, net of other operating expense, increased $5.9 million from the 2007 level to a net income of $0.4 million in 2008. Other operating expense, net of other operating income, increased $27.4 million from the 2006 level to a net expense of $5.5 million in 2007. The variance from 2006 resulted primarily from a $24.8 million pretax gain in 2006 from the sale of contractual rights to mine the Bellwood quarry in Atlanta, Georgia with no similar gain in 2007. Other Income (Expense), Net In 2008, other expense of $4.4 million declined $0.9 million from 2007. In 2007, other expense was $5.3 million compared to other income of $28.5 million in 2006. Gains attributable to increases in the carrying value of the ECU earn out amounted to $1.9 million during 2007 compared with $28.7 million in 2006. Interest Income Interest income was $3.1 million in 2008 compared with $6.6 million in 2007. This decrease in interest income resulted primarily from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances resulting primarily from the financing requirements of the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition. Interest income in 2007 increased $0.5 million from the 2006 level. Interest Expense Interest expense was $172.8 million in 2008 compared with the 2007 amount of $48.2 million. This increase in interest expense was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of Florida Rock. Excluding capitalized interest credits, gross interest expense for 2008 was $187.1 million compared with $53.3 million in 2007 and $31.3 million in 2006. Interest expense was $48.2 million in 2007 compared with the 2006 amount of $26.3 million. The $21.9 million increase was due primarily to approximately $3.2 billion in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to acquire Florida Rock. Income Taxes Our 2008 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 102.2%, up 71.6 percentage points from 30.6% in 2007. This increase principally reflected the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, our 2008 effective tax rate for continuing operations was 31.1%, up 0.5 percentage points from 2007. The 2007 rate for continuing operations was down 1.1 percentage points from the 2006 rate of 31.7%. This decrease principally reflected a reduction in state income taxes and an increase in the tax benefit from contributions. Discontinued Operations In 2005, we sold substantially all the assets of our Chemicals business, known as Vulcan Chemicals, to Basic Chemicals, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical Corporation. The purchaser also assumed certain liabilities related to the Chemicals business, including the obligation to monitor and remediate all releases of hazardous materials at or from the Wichita, Geismar and Port Edwards plant facilities. The decision to sell the Chemicals business was based on our desire to focus our resources on the Construction Materials business. Financial results referable to our Chemicals business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. The transaction, which was structured as a sale of assets, involved initial cash proceeds, contingent future proceeds under two earn out provisions and the transfer of certain liabilities. At the closing date, the fair value of the 23 Table of Contents consideration received in connection with the sale of the Chemicals business, including anticipated cash flows from the two earn out agreements, was expected to exceed the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold. However, pursuant to SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, since the proceeds under the earn out agreements were contingent in nature, no gain was recognized on the Chemicals sale and the value recorded at the June 7, 2005 closing date referable to these two earn outs was limited to $128.2 million. Furthermore, under SAB Topic 5:Z:5, upward adjustments to the fair value of the ECU earn out subsequent to closing, which totaled $51.3 million, were recorded in continuing operations, and therefore did not contribute to the gain or loss on the sale of the Chemicals business. Ultimately, gain or loss on disposal will be recognized to the extent future cash receipts under the 5CP (hydrochlorocarbon product HCC 240fa) earn out related to the remaining performance period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2012 exceed or fall short of its $10.8 million December 31, 2008 carrying amount. Pretax operating results from discontinued operations were a loss of $4.1 million in 2008 compared with a loss of $19.3 million in 2007. These operating losses reflect charges related to general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals businesses. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting Changes FAS 157 On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157) with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. FAS 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities had no effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Additionally, its adoption resulted in no material changes in our valuation methodologies, techniques or assumptions for such assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption Fair Value Measurements for disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities pursuant to the requirements of FAS 157. FAS 158 On January 1, 2008, we adopted the measurement date provision of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (FAS 158). In addition to the recognition provisions (which we adopted December 31, 2006), FAS 158 requires an employer to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its year end balance sheet. This requirement was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Upon adopting the measurement date provision, we remeasured plan assets and benefit obligations as of January 1, 2008, pursuant to the transition requirements of FAS 158. The transition adjustment resulted in an increase to noncurrent assets of $15.0 million, an increase to noncurrent liabilities of $2.2 million, an increase to deferred tax liabilities of $5.1 million, a decrease to retained earnings of $1.3 million and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $9.0 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe we have sufficient financial resources, including cash provided by operating activities, unused bank lines of credit and access to the capital markets, to fund business requirements in the future, including debt service obligations, cash contractual obligations, capital expenditures and dividend payments. In February 2009, we issued $400 million of long term debt (as noted in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements) and used the proceeds to reduce short term bank borrowings, thereby freeing up a like amount of liquidity under our bank lines of credit. Debt reduction and achieving target debt ratios remain a priority use of cash flows. We expect to reduce total debt by $200 million during 2009, excluding any earnings effect from the economic stimulus plan. For the full year 2009, we expect capital spending, excluding acquisitions, to approximate $200 million, down sharply from the $354.2 million spent in 2008. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities (including discontinued operations) decreased $272.9 million to $435.2 million during 2008 as compared with a total of $708.1 million in 2007. Net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to goodwill impairment and depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization accounted for $84.8 million of the decrease. In addition, certain assets were required to be disposed of as a condition to the acquisition of Florida Rock (Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). The reclassification of gains resulting from these dispositions and other net gains on sale of property, plant equipment contributed an additional $35.6 million to the year over year decrease in cash provided by operating activities as the associated cash received is presented as a component of investing activities. Reductions in trade payables and other accruals accounted for an additional $102.6 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities (including discontinued operations) totaled $708.1 million in 2007, an increase of $128.8 million or 22% as compared with 2006. Net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses related to depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization increased $25.8 million when compared with the prior year. Comparative changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities contributed approximately $129.0 million to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, primarily resulting from decreases in accounts receivable and income tax liabilities. Partially offsetting these favorable changes to operating cash flows was a reclassification to investing activities of $28.3 million related to net gains on sales of property, plant equipment and contractual rights. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $189.0 million in 2008 compared with $3,654.3 million in 2007. The $3,465.3 million decrease was largely attributable to the acquisition of Florida Rock in 2007, which required cash payments of $3,239.0 million, net of cash acquired and including Vulcans direct transaction costs. A reduction in capital spending of $130.1 million from the prior year reflects our focus on utilizing cash to reduce debt. Proceeds from the sale of businesses required to be divested as part of the Florida Rock acquisition contributed to a $195.2 million increase in proceeds from the sale of businesses, partially offset by a $63.4 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant equipment. Additionally, $36.7 million in assets held in money market and other money funds were reclassified from cash equivalents to medium term investments during 2008, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $270.8 million in 2008, as compared with net cash provided by financing activities during 2007 of $2,925.8 million. The $3,196.6 million decrease in cash generated from financing activities was due primarily to a $2,901.6 million change in net short term borrowing activity, an increase in payments of short term debt and current maturities of $46.8 million, and a $271.0 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt, net of discounts and debt issuance costs. Proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in 2008 of $949.1 million were used to pay down short term borrowings drawn during 2007 to fund the Florida Rock acquisition (Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). Partially offsetting these decreases in cash from financing activities were cash proceeds of $55.1 million from the issuance of common stock, as discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Our policy is to pay out a reasonable share of net cash provided by operating activities as dividends, consistent on average with the payout record of past years, while maintaining debt ratios within what we believe to be prudent and generally acceptable limits. Working Capital Working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, totaled ($769.2) million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $601.8 million from the ($1,371.0) million level at December 31, 2007. The increase in working capital primarily resulted from a decrease of $1,009.0 million in short term borrowings partially offset by an increase in current maturities of $276.5 million. Weakness in demand for our products resulted in a $64.9 million year over year decrease in net accounts and notes receivable, offset by a related decrease in trade payables and accruals of $72.4 million. As of December 31, 2008, we have $1,672.5 million in bank lines of credit, of which $1,082.5 million was drawn. Working capital totaled ($1,371.0) million at December 31, 2007, a decrease of $1,614.7 million from the $243.7 million level at December 31, 2006. The 2007 decrease resulted primarily from the use of cash and short term 25 Table of Contents borrowings to fund the acquisition of Florida Rock. Excluding the effects of the change in short term borrowings, working capital increased $278.0 million, primarily due to inventory and accounts receivable, offset in part by current trade payables and accrued liabilities, acquired in the Florida Rock transaction. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures, which exclude business acquisitions, totaled $354.2 million in 2008, down $126.3 million from the 2007 level of $480.5 million. During 2008, we completed three major aggregates plant rebuilds and continued the multi year expansion project at our Newberry Cement plant. As explained in the Financial Terminology, we classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project. In 2008, profit adding projects accounted for $230.1 million or 65% of the 2008 spending. Commitments for capital expenditures were $25.0 million at December 31, 2008. We expect to fund these commitments using available cash, internally generated cash flow or additional borrowings. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2008, the total purchase price (cash and stock consideration paid) of acquisitions amounted to $152.1 million, down significantly from the prior year, which included $4,678.4 million related to the Florida Rock acquisition (the largest in our history). As a result of the 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, we entered into a Final Judgment with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that required us to divest nine Florida Rock and Legacy Vulcan sites. We completed these divestitures in 2008 resulting in the acquisition of several sites through exchanges with various entities, as follows. In a transaction with Luck Stone Corporation, we acquired two aggregates production facilities in Virginia and cash in exchange for two Florida Rock sites in Virginia, an aggregates production facility and a distribution yard. In a transaction with Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Martin Marietta), we received cash and acquired an aggregates production facility near Sacramento, California, real property with proven and permitted reserves adjacent to one of our aggregates production facilities in San Antonio, Texas, and fee ownership of property at one of our aggregates production facilities in North Carolina that we had previously leased from Martin Marietta. In return, we divested four aggregates production facilities and a greenfield (undeveloped) aggregates site located in Georgia, and an aggregates production facility located in Tennessee. Two of the divested sites included in the transaction with Martin Marietta were owned by Vulcan prior to our acquisition of Florida Rock. Accordingly, during 2008, we recognized a pretax gain of $73.8 million on the sale of these assets. In a separate transaction, we sold our interest in an aggregates production facility in Georgia to The Concrete Company, which had been the joint venture partner with Florida Rock in this operation. In addition to the 2008 acquisitions obtained in the aforementioned exchanges, other acquisitions completed during 2008 included four aggregates production facilities, one asphalt mix plant, a recycling facility and vacant land located in California, an aggregates production facility in Illinois and our former joint venture partners interest in an aggregates production facility in Tennessee. These acquisitions cost approximately $108.4 million (total cash and stock consideration paid) including acquisition costs and net of acquired cash. The 2007 acquisitions included the Florida Rock acquisition, an aggregates production facility in Illinois and an aggregates production facility in North Carolina. In addition to these acquisitions, during 2007, we acquired an aggregates production facility in Alabama in exchange for two aggregates production facilities in Illinois. The Florida Rock acquisition (exclusive of divestitures required pursuant to an agreement with the Department of Justice) consisted of 29 aggregates production facilities, 15 aggregates sales yards, 108 concrete plants, 1 cement plant, 1 calcium products plant and 3 cement grinding facilities located in the southeastern and mid Atlantic states. Proven and probable reserves (aggregates, calcium products and cement) acquired in the Florida Rock transaction amounted to approximately 1.7 billion tons. 26 Table of Contents Short term Borrowings and Investments Net short term borrowings and investments at December 31 consisted of the following (in thousands of dollars): 2008 2007 2006 Short term investments Cash equivalents $ 3,217 $ 32,981 $ 50,374 Medium term investments 36,734 0 0 Total short term investments $ 39,951 $ 32,981 $ 50,374 Short term borrowings Bank borrowings $ 1,082,500 $ 1,260,500 $ 2,500 Commercial paper 0 831,000 196,400 Total short term borrowings $ 1,082,500 $ 2,091,500 $ 198,900 Net short term borrowings $ (1,042,549 ) $ ( 2,058,519 ) $ ( 148,526 ) Bank borrowings Maturity 2 days 2 to 22 days January 2007 Weighted average interest rate 1.63 % 4.88 % 5.58 % Commercial paper Maturity n/a 2 to 28 days 2 to 36 days Weighted average interest rate n/a 4.92 % 5.32 % We were a net short term borrower throughout 2008 and ended the year in a net short term borrowed position of $1,042.5 million. In 2008, total short term borrowings reached a peak of $2,192.7 million and amounted to $1,082.5 million at year end. Throughout 2007, we were a net short term borrower and ended the year in a net short term borrowed position of $2,058.5 million. In 2007, total short term borrowings reached a peak of $3,314.9 million and amounted to $2,091.5 million at year end. During most of 2006, we were a net short term borrower and ended the year in a net short term borrowed position of $148.5 million. In 2006, total short term borrowings reached a peak of $236.8 million and amounted to $198.9 million at year end. We utilize our bank lines of credit as liquidity back up for outstanding commercial paper or draw on the bank lines to access London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based short term loans to fund our borrowing requirements. Periodically, we issue commercial paper for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements. We plan to continue this practice from time to time as circumstances warrant. Our policy is to maintain committed credit facilities at least equal to our outstanding commercial paper. Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,672.5 million were maintained at the end of 2008, of which $7.5 million expired January 28, 2009, $165.0 million expires November 16, 2009, and $1,500.0 million expires November 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1,082.5 million of the lines of credit was drawn. Interest rates are determined at the time of borrowing based on current market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, our commercial paper was rated A 2 and P 2 by Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys), respectively. Both Standard Poors and Moodys have assigned a negative outlook to our short term debt ratings. Current Maturities Current maturities of long term debt as of December 31 are summarized below (in thousands of dollars): 2008 2007 2006 3 year floating loan issued 2008 $ 60,000 $ 0 $ 0 6.00% 10 year notes issued 1999 250,000 0 0 Private placement notes 0 33,000 0 Other notes 1,685 2,181 630 Total $ 311,685 $ 35,181 $ 630 27 Table of Contents Scheduled debt payments during 2008 included $33.0 million in December to retire a private placement note, $15.0 million in December representing the first quarterly payment under the 3 year floating rate loan issued in June and payments under various miscellaneous notes that either matured at various dates or required monthly payments. A note in the amount of $1.3 million previously scheduled to be retired in 2008 was extended until May 2009. Scheduled debt payments during 2007 were composed of miscellaneous notes that matured at various dates. Maturity dates for our $311.7 million of current maturities as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: March 2009 $15.0 million, April 2009 $250.0 million, May 2009 $1.3 million, June 2009 $15.0 million, September 2009 $15.0 million, December 2009 $15.0 million, and various dates for the remaining $0.4 million. We expect to retire this debt using available cash or by issuing commercial paper or other debt securities. Debt and Capital The calculations of our total debt as a percentage of total capital and the weighted average stated interest rates on our long term debt as of December 31 are summarized below (amounts in thousands, except percentages): 2008 2007 2006 Debt Current maturities of long term debt $ 311,685 $ 35,181 $ 630 Short term borrowings 1,082,500 2,091,500 198,900 Long term debt 2,153,588 1,529,828 322,064 Total debt $ 3,547,773 $ 3,656,509 $ 521,594 Capital Total debt $ 3,547,773 $ 3,656,509 $ 521,594 Shareholders equity 3,522,736 3,759,600 2,010,899 Total capital $ 7,070,509 $ 7,416,109 $ 2,532,493 Total debt as a percentage of total capital 50.2 % 49.3 % 20.6 % Long term debt weighted average stated interest rate 6.72 % 6.67 % 6.42 % Our debt agreements do not subject us to contractual restrictions with regard to working capital or the amount we may expend for cash dividends and purchases of our stock. The percentage of consolidated debt to total capitalization (total debt as a percentage of total capital), as defined in our bank credit facility agreements, must be less than 65%. In the future, our total debt as a percentage of total capital will depend on specific investment and financing decisions. As a result of our financing to fund the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, our total debt as a percentage of total capital increased for the two subsequent periods above. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating and expect our operating cash flows will enable us to reduce our total debt as a percentage of total capital to a target range of 35% to 40% within the next five years, in line with our historical capital structure targets. We have made acquisitions from time to time and will continue to pursue attractive investment opportunities. Such acquisitions could be funded by using internally generated cash or issuing debt or equity securities. During the three year period ended December 31, 2008, long term debt increased cumulatively by $1,830.2 million from the $323.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2005. During the same three year period, shareholders equity, net of dividends of $541.6 million, increased by $1,389.1 million to $3,522.7 million. During 2008, long term debt increased by $623.8 million to $2,153.6 million, compared with a net increase of $1,207.8 million in 2007. Both the 2008 and 2007 increases relate primarily to debt issuances to fund the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. The issuances noted below effectively replace the short term borrowings we incurred to initially fund the cash portion of the acquisition. In June 2008, we issued $650.0 million of long term notes in two series (tranches), as follows: $250.0 million of 5 year 6.30% coupon notes and $400.0 million of 10 year 7.00% coupon notes. These notes are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 net of discounts from par in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. These discounts are being amortized using the effective interest method over the 28 Table of Contents respective lives of the notes. The effective interest rates for the 5 year and 10 year 2008 note issuances, including the effects of underwriting commissions and the settlement of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements, are 7.47% and 7.86%, respectively. Additionally, in June 2008 we established a $300.0 million 3 year syndicated floating rate term loan based on a spread over LIBOR (1, 2, 3 or 6 month LIBOR options). As of December 31, 2008, the spread was 1.5 percentage points above the selected LIBOR option. The spread is subject to increase if our long term credit ratings are downgraded. This loan requires quarterly principal payments of $15.0 million starting in December 2008 and a final principal payment of $135.0 million in June 2011. In December 2007, we issued $1,225.0 million of long term notes in four related series (tranches), as follows: $325.0 million of 3 year floating rate notes, $300.0 million of 5 year 5.60% coupon notes, $350.0 million of 10 year 6.40% coupon notes and $250.0 million of 30 year 7.15% coupon notes. Concurrent with the issuance of the notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the $325.0 million 3 year floating rate notes to convert them to a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. These notes are presented in our financial statements net of discounts from par in the amounts of $0.0 million, $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively. These discounts are being amortized using the effective interest method over the respective lives of the notes. The effective interest rates for these notes, including the effects of underwriting commissions and other debt issuance costs, the above mentioned interest rate swap agreement and the settlement of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements, are 5.41%, 6.58%, 7.39% and 8.04% for the 3 year, 5 year, 10 year and 30 year notes, respectively. Additionally, as a result of the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition, we assumed existing debt as follows: $17.6 million of variable rate tax exempt industrial revenue bonds of which $3.6 million is secured, unsecured notes in the amount of $0.6 million and secured notes in the amount of $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, Standard Poors and Moodys rated our public long term debt at the BBB and Baa2 level, respectively. Both Standard Poors and Moodys have assigned a negative outlook to our long term debt ratings. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Credit Facilities Our obligations to make future payments under contracts as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table below (in millions of dollars): Payments Due by Year Note Reference Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Cash Contractual Obligations Short term borrowings Lines of credit drawn1 Note 6 $ 1,082.5 $ 1,082.5 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 Interest payments 1.4 1.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 Long term debt Principal payments Note 6 2,467.1 311.7 570.6 562.6 1,022.2 Interest payments Note 6 1,199.6 137.8 233.6 179.2 649.0 Operating leases Note 7 125.4 27.9 39.2 27.9 30.4 Mineral royalties Note 12 194.9 14.8 21.2 15.4 143.5 Unconditional purchase obligations Capital Note 12 25.0 25.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Noncapital2 Note 12 88.4 28.9 25.4 16.8 17.3 Benefit plans3 Note 10 528.7 38.7 86.7 99.3 304.0 Total cash contractual obligations4,5 $ 5,713.0 $ 1,668.7 $ 976.7 $ 901.2 $ 2,166.4 1 Lines of credit drawn represent borrowings under our five year credit facility which expires November 16, 2012. 2 Noncapital unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to transportation and electrical contracts. 3 Payments in Thereafter column for benefit plans are for the years 2014 2018. 4 The above table excludes discounted asset retirement obligations in the amount of $173.4 million at December 31, 2008, the majority of which have an estimated settlement date beyond 2013 (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements). 5 The above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $18.1 million at December 31, 2008, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payment of these FIN 48 liabilities (for more details, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). We estimate cash requirements for income taxes in 2009 to be $50.1 million, including the effect of refunds from overpayments during 2008. We have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings. These contracts are discrete in nature, and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event. The future payments under these contracts are not included in the table set forth above. Our credit facilities as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table below (in millions of dollars): Amount and Year of Expiration Total Facilities 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Credit Facilities Lines of credit $ 1,672.5 $ 172.5 $ 0.0 $ 1,500.0 $ 0.0 Standby letters of credit 116.1 116.0 0.0 0.1 0.0 Total credit facilities $ 1,788.6 $ 288.5 $ 0.0 $ 1,500.1 $ 0.0 Unsecured bank lines of credit totaling $1,672.5 million were maintained at the end of 2008, of which $7.5 million expired January 28, 2009, $165.0 million expires November 16, 2009, and $1,500.0 million expires November 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1,082.5 million of the lines of credit was drawn. Standby Letters of Credit We provide certain third parties with irrevocable standby letters of credit in the normal course of business. We use commercial banks to issue standby letters of credit to back our obligations to pay or perform when required to do so 30 Table of Contents pursuant to the requirements of an underlying agreement or the provision of goods and services. The standby letters of credit listed below are cancelable only at the option of the beneficiaries who are authorized to draw drafts on the issuing bank up to the face amount of the standby letter of credit in accordance with its terms. Since banks consider letters of credit as contingent extensions of credit, we are required to pay a fee until they expire or are canceled. Substantially all of our standby letters of credit have a one year term and are renewable annually at the option of the beneficiary. Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table below (in millions of dollars): Amount Standby Letters of Credit Risk management requirement for insurance claims $ 45.6 Payment surety required by utilities 0.4 Contractual reclamation/restoration requirements 55.9 Financing requirement for industrial revenue bond 14.2 Total standby letters of credit $ 116.1 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities, that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Common Stock Our decisions to purchase shares of our common stock are based on valuation and price, our liquidity and debt level, and our actual and projected cash requirements for investment projects and regular dividends. The amount, if any, of future share purchases will be determined by management from time to time based on various factors, including those listed above. Shares purchased have historically been used for general corporate purposes, including distributions under long term incentive plans. The number and cost of shares purchased during each of the last three years and shares held in treasury at year end are shown below: 2008 2007 2006 Shares purchased Number 0 44,123 6,757,361 Total cost (millions) $ 0.0 $ 4.8 $ 522.8 Average cost $ 0.00 $ 108.78 $ 77.37 Shares in treasury at year end Number 0 0 45,098,644 Average cost $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 28.78 On November 16, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the agreement to acquire Florida Rock, all treasury stock held immediately prior to the close of the transaction was canceled. Our Board of Directors resolved to carry forward the existing authorization to purchase common stock. Presently, we do not anticipate the purchase of our common stock in a material amount. The number of shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the Board of Directors was 3,411,416 as of December 31, 2008. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. As previously noted, on January 1, 2008, we adopted 31 Table of Contents FAS 157 with respect to financial assets and liabilities and elected to defer our adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities as permitted by FSP FAS 157 2. FAS 157 applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value; accordingly, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. Fair value under FAS 157 is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. In support of this principle, the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data; for example, a reporting entitys own data. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. For nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequent basis, FSP FAS 157 2 requires companies to adopt the provisions of FAS 157 for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations FAS 141(R), which requires the acquirer in a business combination to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value. FAS 141(R) applies whenever an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. Additionally, the new standard requires that in a business combination: Acquisition related costs, such as legal and due diligence costs, be expensed as incurred. Acquirer shares issued as consideration be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration arrangements be included in the purchase price allocation at their acquisition date fair value. With certain exceptions, pre acquisition contingencies be recorded at fair value. Negative goodwill be recognized as income rather than as a pro rata reduction of the value allocated to particular assets. Restructuring plans be recorded in purchase accounting only if the requirements in FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, are met as of the acquisition date. FAS 141(R) requires prospective application for business combinations consummated in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008; we will adopt FAS 141(R) on January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). The standard requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests, sometimes referred to as minority interests, in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Noncontrolling interest under FAS 160 is defined as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The standard requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, but separate from the parents equity. The amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest should be presented separately on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings. When a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be measured at fair value, and a gain or loss recognized accordingly. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160 on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (FAS 161). The enhanced disclosure requirements of FAS 161 are intended to help investors better understand how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS 133, and how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The enhanced disclosures include, for example: 32 Table of Contents Qualitative disclosure about the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments. Tabular disclosures of the fair value amounts of derivative instruments, their gains and losses and locations within the financial statements. Disclosure of any features in a derivative instrument that are credit risk related. FAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We expect to adopt the disclosure requirements of FAS 161 no later than our interim period ending March 31, 2009. In April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP FAS 142 3). This position amends the factors an entity should consider when developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142 3 requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements in determining the amortizable useful life. Additionally, this position requires expanded disclosure regarding renewable intangible assets. FSP FAS 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Early adoption was prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 142 3 on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (FAS 162). FAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. FAS 162 became effective on November 15, 2008. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1), which requires entities to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share for participating securities that include awards that accrue cash dividends (whether paid or unpaid) any time common shareholders receive dividends and those dividends will not be returned to the entity if the employee forfeits the award. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption was prohibited and retroactive disclosure is required. We do not expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03 6 1 on January 1, 2009 to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities. This FSP amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, to require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to require additional disclosure regarding involvement with variable interest entities. The adoption of the disclosure requirements of this FSP as of December 2008 did not have a material effect on our notes to the consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends SFAS No. 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, to require more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets, including employers investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The additional disclosure requirements of this FSP are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial 33 Table of Contents statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, as of January 1 for the recent completed fiscal year, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two step process. The first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. As of December 31, 2008, goodwill totaled $3,083.0 million as compared with $3,789.1 million at December 31, 2007. Total goodwill represented 35% of total assets at December 31, 2008, compared with 42% and 18% as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in 2008 resulted from a $596.2 million reduction in the Florida Rock acquisition goodwill as a result of the final purchase price allocation (for more details, see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $252.7 million as noted below. The increase in 2007 resulted primarily from the preliminary purchase price allocation for the November 2007 Florida Rock acquisition. The impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of business reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt mix, concrete and cement. Within these four operating segments, we have identified 13 reporting units based primarily on geographical location. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those reporting units as of the January 1 measurement date. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market approach, which involves the application of revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies. We consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to market capitalization. The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of January 1, 2009 indicated that the carrying value of our Cement reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Based on the preliminary results of the second step of the impairment test, we estimated that the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit was impaired. Therefore, we recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2008. The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of January 1, 2008 and 2007 indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. 34 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a decline in our stock price, a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future. For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long lived Assets Excluding Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets. Fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets. For additional information regarding long lived assets and intangible assets, see Notes 4 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. Reclamation Costs Reclamation costs resulting from the normal use of long lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from the normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement. In determining the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is then discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit adjusted, risk free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement. In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative. Reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility. For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (commonly known as asset retirement obligations), see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We follow the guidance of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (FAS 87), SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106), and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (FAS 158) when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The primary assumptions are as follows: Discount Rate The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. Expected Return on Plan Assets We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs. Rate of Compensation Increase For salary related plans only, we project employees annual pay increases, which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement. Rate of Increase in the Per Capita Cost of Covered Healthcare Benefits We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits. The provisions of FAS 87 and FAS 106 provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. FAS 158 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, caption 2006 FAS 158 for a detailed description) partially supersedes the delayed recognition principles of FAS 87 and FAS 106 by requiring that differences between actual results and expected or estimated results be recognized in full in other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income pursuant to FAS 158 are reclassified to earnings in accordance with the recognition principles of FAS 87 and FAS 106. Upon our January 1, 2008 adoption of the measurement date provisions of FAS 158 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, caption 2008 FAS 158) we changed our measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to December 31. Previously, we had accelerated our measurement date to November 30. Annually, we review our assumptions related to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits. In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed income security yields, specifically high quality bonds. At December 31, 2008, the discount rate for our plans increased to 6.60% from 6.45% at November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 87 (pensions) and increased to 6.65% from 6.10% at November 30, 2007 for purposes of determining our liability under FAS 106 (other postretirement benefits). An analysis of the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high quality bonds is used in the selection of the discount rate. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2008, the expected return on plan assets remained 8.25%. In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2008, the inflation component of the assumed rate of compensation increase remained 2.25%. In addition, based on future expectations of merit and productivity increases, the weighted average component of the salary increase assumption remained 2.50%. In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 2008, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita 36 Table of Contents cost of covered healthcare benefits increased to 9.0% for 2009, decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2017 and remaining level thereafter. Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions (in millions of dollars): (Favorable) Unfavorable 0.5 Percentage Point Increase 0.5 Percentage Point Decrease Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) in Benefit Obligation in Benefit Cost in Benefit Obligation in Benefit Cost Actuarial Assumptions Discount rate: Pension $ (35.6 ) $ (3.9 ) $ 39.4 $ 1.9 Other postretirement benefits (4.2 ) (0.2 ) 4.5 0.4 Expected return on plan assets not applicable (3.2 ) not applicable 3.2 Rate of compensation increase (for salary related plans) 7.9 1.8 (7.2 ) (2.0 ) Rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits 5.0 0.9 (4.4 ) (0.7 ) As of the December 31, 2008 measurement date, the pension plans fair value of assets decreased from $679.7 million to $419.0 million due primarily to relatively poor market performance for the domestic and international equity classes and a $48.0 million write down in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. Earnings on assets above or below the expected return are reflected in the calculation of pension expense through the calculation of the market related value, which recognizes changes in fair value averaged on a systematic basis over five years. As a result of the June 2005 sale of our Chemicals business, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2006, we recognized a settlement charge of $0.8 million representing an acceleration of unrecognized losses due to lump sum payments to certain retirees from our former Chemicals business. During 2009, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately $15.8 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately $13.2 million compared with $8.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively, in 2008. This increase in pension expense is primarily related to the asset losses during 2008. Normal cash payments made for pension benefits in 2009 under the unfunded plans are estimated at $3.5 million. We expect to make approximately $1.1 million in required contributions to the funded pension plans during 2009, all of which relates to the pension plan assumed in the Florida Rock acquisition. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), enacted on August 17, 2006, significantly changed the funding requirements after 2007 for single employer defined benefit pension plans, among other provisions. Funding requirements under the PPA are largely based on a plans funded status, with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses. This Act did not have a material impact on the funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans during 2008. While negative returns on plan assets in 2008 have diminished our plans funded status, including the write down in the estimated fair value of certain assets invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements), we currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration. For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Environmental Compliance We incur environmental compliance costs, which include maintenance and operating costs for pollution control facilities, the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. Environmental expenditures that pertain to current operations or that relate to future revenues are expensed or capitalized consistent with our capitalization policy. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues are expensed. Costs associated with environmental assessments and remediation efforts are accrued when management determines that a liability is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily identified, due in part to the uncertainties of varying factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2008, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range was $2.1 million. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs. For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Claims and Litigation Including Self insurance We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self insurance program. We are self insured for losses related to workers compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these deductible levels. Under our self insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. Accrued liabilities under our self insurance program were $57.8 million, $62.5 million and $45.2 million as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately $19.0 million of the increase from 2006 to 2007 relates to liabilities acquired in the Florida Rock acquisition. Accrued liabilities for self insurance reserves as of December 31, 2008 were discounted at 1.96%. As of December 31, 2008, the undiscounted amount was $61.2 million as compared with the discounted liability of $57.8 million. Expected payments (undiscounted) for the next five years are projected as follows: 2009 $20.2 million; 2010 $11.0 million; 2011 $8.5 million; 2012 $5.3 million and 2013 $3.9 million. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, we estimate the annual tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate. As the year progresses, we refine the estimates of the years taxable income as new information becomes available, including year to date financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. 38 Table of Contents In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income, and we will record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We take into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future taxable income, mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of a realization of a deferred tax asset. To the extent recovery is unlikely, a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made. If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made. Conversely, if we were to make a determination that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded. Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas, does not require U.S. income taxes to be provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. We periodically evaluate our investment strategies with respect to each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and, accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007 (see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements). In accordance with FIN 48, we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is reflected in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings. Due to the magnitude of the impact of statutory depletion on our effective tax rate and taxable income, a significant portion of the financial reporting risk is related to this estimate. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a new deduction for certain domestic production activities as described in Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, this deduction, subject to certain limitations, was set at 3% for 2006, 6% in 2007 and will remain at 6% through 2009 and reaches 9% in 2010 and thereafter. The 39 Table of Contents estimated impact of this deduction on the 2008, 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates is presented in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding income taxes and our adoption of FIN 48, see Notes 9 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Forward looking Statements The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I, above. 40 Table of Contents Financial Terminology Acquisitions The sum of net assets (assets less liabilities, including acquired debt) obtained in a business combination. Net assets are recorded at their fair value at the date of the combination, and include tangible and intangible items. Capital Employed The sum of interest bearing debt, other noncurrent liabilities and shareholders equity. Average capital employed is a 12 month average. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures include capitalized replacements of and additions to property, plant equipment, including capitalized leases, renewals and betterments. Capital expenditures exclude the property, plant equipment obtained by business acquisitions. We classify our capital expenditures into three categories based on the predominant purpose of the project expenditures. Thus, a project is classified entirely as a replacement if that is the principal reason for making the expenditure even though the project may involve some cost saving and or capacity improvement aspects. Likewise, a profit adding project is classified entirely as such if the principal reason for making the expenditure is to add operating facilities at new locations (which occasionally replace facilities at old locations), to add product lines, to expand the capacity of existing facilities, to reduce costs, to increase mineral reserves, to improve products, etc. Capital expenditures classified as environmental control do not reflect those expenditures for environmental control activities, including industrial health programs that are expensed currently. Such expenditures are made on a continuing basis and at significant levels. Frequently, profit adding and major replacement projects also include expenditures for environmental control purposes. Net Sales Total customer revenues from continuing operations for our products and services excluding third party delivery revenues, net of discounts and taxes, if any. Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges The sum of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interest in earnings of a consolidated subsidiary, amortization of capitalized interest and fixed charges net of interest capitalization credits, divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges are the sum of interest expense before capitalization credits, amortization of financing costs and one third of rental expense. Total Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital The sum of short term borrowings, current maturities and long term debt, divided by total capital. Total capital is the sum of total debt and shareholders equity. Shareholders Equity The sum of common stock (less the cost of common stock in treasury), capital in excess of par value, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), as reported in the balance sheet. Average shareholders equity is a 12 month average. Total Shareholder Return Average annual rate of return using both stock price appreciation and quarterly dividend reinvestment. Stock price appreciation is based on a point to point calculation, using end of year data. 41 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our various credit facilities and long term debt instruments. At times, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk. In December 2007, we issued $325 million of 3 year floating (variable) rate notes that bear interest at 3 month LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a counterparty in the stated (notional) amount of $325 million and a contractual term coinciding with the maturity of the $325 million of 3 year floating rate notes. At December 31, 2008, we recognized a liability of $16.2 million, equal to the fair value of this swap (included in other noncurrent liabilities) and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $9.6 million, net of tax of $6.6 million, equal to the highly effective portion of this swap. At December 31, 2007, we recognized a liability of $1.1 million equal to the fair value of this swap (included in other noncurrent liabilities), and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.7 million, net of tax of $0.4 million, equal to the highly effective portion of this swap. We are exposed to market risk for changes in LIBOR as a result of this interest rate swap agreement. A decline in interest rates of 0.75 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately $4.4 million. At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair market value of our long term debt instruments including current maturities was $2,155.2 million as compared with a book value of $2,465.3 million. The effect of a decline in interest rates of 1 percentage point would increase the fair market value of our liability by approximately $74.5 million. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this annual report. 42 Table of Contents
