Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we use significant judgment in accounting for goodwill and goodwill impairment; impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill; reclamation costs; pension and other postretirement benefits; environmental compliance; claims and litigation including self insurance; and income taxes. Although we believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. Page 16 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Aggregates As the largest U.S. producer of construction aggregates, we have operating facilities across the U.S. and in Mexico and the Bahamas. We principally serve markets in 21 states, the District of Columbia and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico and the Bahamas. Our primary focus is serving states and metropolitan markets in the U.S. that are predicted to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. Our current estimate of 14.2 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves reflects a decrease of 0.2 billion tons, on a comparable basis, from the estimate at the end of 2008. Estimates of reserves are of recoverable stone, sand and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by our geologists and engineers, recognizing reasonable economic and operating restraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and subject to permit or other restrictions. Proven, or measured, reserves are those reserves for which the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed by drill data, together with other direct and measurable observations such as outcrops, trenches and quarry faces; the grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and the sampling and measurement data are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. Probable, or indicated, reserves are those reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed partly from specific measurements and partly from projections based on reasonable, though not drilled, geologic evidence. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Reported proven and probable reserves include only quantities that are owned in fee or under lease, and for which all appropriate zoning and permitting have been obtained. Leases, zoning, permits, reclamation plans and other government or industry regulations often set limits on the areas, depths and lengths of time allowed for mining, stipulate setbacks and slopes that must be left in place, and designate which areas may be used for surface facilities, Page 17 Table of Contents berms, and overburden or waste storage, among other requirements and restrictions. Our reserve estimates take into account these factors. Technical and economic factors also affect the estimates of reported reserves regardless of what might otherwise be considered proven or probable based on a geologic analysis. For example, excessive overburden or weathered rock, rock quality issues, excessive mining depths, groundwater issues, overlying wetlands, endangered species habitats, and rights of way or easements may effectively limit the quantity of reserves considered proven and probable. In addition, computations for reserves in place are adjusted for estimates of unsaleable sizes and materials as well as pit and plant waste. The 14.2 billion tons of estimated aggregates reserves reported at the end of 2009 include reserves at inactive and greenfield (undeveloped) sites. We reported proven and probable reserves of 13.3 billion tons at the end of 2008. That determination excluded reserves at inactive and greenfield sites that otherwise qualified as proven or probable reserves and could be economically and legally extracted. Including inactive and greenfield sites, proven and probable reserves at the end of 2008 were 14.4 billion tons. This table presents, by division, the tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves as of December 31, 2009 and the types of facilities operated.

Of the 14.2 billion tons of aggregates reserves, 8.0 billion tons or 56% are located on owned land and 6.2 billion tons or 44% are located on leased land. While some of our leases run until reserves at the leased sites are exhausted, generally our leases have definite expiration dates, which range from 2010 to 2159. Most of our leases have renewal options to extend them well beyond their current terms at our discretion. The following table lists our ten largest active aggregates facilities based on the total proven and probable reserves at the sites. None of our aggregates facilities contributes more than 5% to our net sales.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business. We are a defendant in various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. It is not possible to determine with precision the outcome of, or the amount of liability, if any, under these lawsuits, especially where the cases involve possible jury trials with as yet undetermined jury panels.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY DRIVERS OF VALUE CREATION *Source: Woods Poole Economics and Moodys Economy.com Financial highlights for 2009 Net earnings from continuing operations were $18.6 million compared to $3.4 million in the prior year EBITDA was $548.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $886.5 million in the prior year Aggregates shipments declined 26%, reducing earnings by $333.7 million Aggregates pricing increased 3%, increasing earnings by $48.3 million Cost management and productivity improvements reduced the effects of lower volumes on our earnings and cash flow Aggregates cash fixed costs decreased $48.7 million, or 14% Selling, administrative and general expense decreased 6% Cash provided by operating activities increased 4% to $453.0 million in 2009 compared to $435.2 million in 2008 Full year capital spending was reduced 69% to $109.7 million compared to $353.2 million in the prior year Free cash flow increased to $343.3 million in 2009 compared to $82.0 million in 2008 Private placement debt offering in the first quarter raised $394.6 million in net proceeds Public offering of equity in the second quarter raised $520.0 million in net proceeds Total debt was reduced by $809.8 million In 2009, we faced declining demand for our products due to economic conditions that resulted in a sharp slowdown in the private construction market. New home construction declined to historically low levels, while tight credit and business failures contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings, particularly stores and offices. Construction activity funded by the public sector, typically less affected in economic cycles, was weak as Page 23 Table of Contents well in 2009. Declining state revenues reduced the amount of funds available at the state level for public construction projects. The effects of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) were helpful, but the bulk of funds for transportation infrastructure under this Act will be spent in 2010 and 2011. The positive effects of ARRA spending in 2009 were somewhat offset by the failure of Congress to extend or reauthorize the most recent multi year federal transportation bill, which expired on September 30, 2009. As a result, funds for highway construction are being provided by a series of relatively short continuing resolutions and at funding levels considerably below what would have been available had Congress extended the provisions of SAFETEA LU. This uncertainty compelled many states to postpone highway maintenance and improvement projects. ARRA includes economic stimulus funding of $50 to $60 billion for heavy construction projects that use our products, including $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. Vulcan served states were apportioned 55% more funds than other states, with California, Texas and Florida receiving nearly 23% of the total for highways and bridges. Beginning in mid year 2009, highway construction awards were buoyed by stimulus related funding. Through December 2009, the Federal Highway Administration reported that approximately 85% of the $27.5 billion of funding for highway and bridge projects had been obligated, $15 billion was under construction and $5.6 billion had been paid to contractors for work performed. During this period, most Vulcan served states lagged the rest of the country in awarding and starting stimulus related highway construction projects. These differences in awarding projects and spending patterns were due in part to the types of projects planned and to the proportion sub allocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming. However, in the fourth quarter, contract awards for highways in Vulcan served states increased 13% from 2008 compared to a 2% increase in other states. This provides some evidence that construction activity in Vulcan served states will improve in 2010. Despite these challenging conditions, we have worked diligently to manage effectively those aspects of the business that we are able to control. We were able to achieve modest price increases, which helped offset lower sales volumes. We reduced selling, administrative and general expenses by $21.0 million compared to 2008. We adjusted production levels to meet demand and, as a result, employment levels across the company were 12% lower than in 2008. These effective cost management efforts have allowed us to maximize cash flow in a period of unprecedented and prolonged economic downturn. RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Free cash flow and EBITDA are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP); thus, they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by GAAP. These metrics are presented for the convenience of investment professionals that use such metrics in their analysis and to provide our shareholders with an understanding of the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. These metrics are often used by the investment community as indicators of a companys ability to incur and service debt. We internally use free cash flow, EBITDA and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources internally. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below: Free cash flow Free cash flow deducts purchases of property, plant equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. in millions 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $453.0 $ 435.2 $ 708.1 Less Purchases of property, plant equipment (109.7 ) (353.2 ) (483.3 ) Free cash flow $343.3 $ 82.0 $ 224.8 Page 24 Table of Contents EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.

The results of operations discussed below include Florida Rock for the periods from November 16, 2007 through December 31, 2007, and the full calendar years 2008 and 2009. We include intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment revenue at the product line level. Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business. Page 25 Table of Contents Consolidated operating results Amounts and shares in millions, except per share data For the years ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 2,543.7 $ 3,453.1 $ 3,090.1 Cost of goods sold 2,097.7 2,703.4 2,139.2 Gross profit $ 446.0 $ 749.7 $ 950.9 Operating earnings $ 148.5 $ 249.1 $ 714.4 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (19.2 ) $ 75.1 $ 667.5 Earnings from continuing operations $ 18.6 $ 3.4 $ 463.1 Earnings (loss) on discontinued operations, net of income taxes 11.7 (2.5 ) (12.2 ) Net earnings $ 30.3 $ 0.9 $ 450.9 Basic earnings (loss) per share Continuing operations $ 0.16 $ 0.03 $ 4.77 Discontinued operations 0.09 (0.02 ) (0.12 ) Net earnings $ 0.25 $ 0.01 $ 4.65 Diluted earnings (loss) per share Continuing operations $ 0.16 $ 0.03 $ 4.66 Discontinued operations 0.09 (0.02 ) (0.12 ) Net earnings $ 0.25 $ 0.01 $ 4.54 EBITDA (adjusted EBITDA in 2008) $ 548.4 $ 886.5 $ 980.6 The economic downturn and other external factors affecting the construction industry continued to present challenges for our business. Continued weakness in private construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, and the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of either a formal extension or reauthorization of the multi year federal highway program offset the benefits of stimulus related construction activity in 2009. Furthermore, construction activity on stimulus related highway projects varied widely in Vulcan served states, and in certain key states lagged the rest of the country. We continue to run the business in a cost efficient manner, with a focus on effectively managing those aspects of cost we can control or influence in order to maximize our cash generation during the economic downturn. Our efforts contributed to reductions in cash fixed costs in our operations as well as reductions in overhead expenses. The average selling price for aggregates increased 3% in 2009 despite lower shipments, reflecting attractive pricing fundamentals of our business. The higher selling price for aggregates reflects increased market prices as well as proportionately greater levels of higher priced aggregates used for highway construction. As a result of these actions, the cash earnings generated on each ton of aggregates sold in 2009 nearly matched the record level achieved in 2008. The increased level of unit profitability supports our optimism about the earnings potential of our business when demand begins to recover. The 2008 results include an estimated $227.6 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, after tax goodwill impairment charge for our Cement segment which is located in Florida. The 2008 results also include net earnings per diluted share of $0.34 from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. Results in 2007 include net earnings per diluted share of $0.24 from the sale of real estate in California. Additionally, higher energy related costs lowered earnings by $0.86 per diluted share in 2008 as compared to 2007. Page 26 Table of Contents Year over year changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below (in millions of dollars): 2007 $ 668 Lower aggregates earnings due to Lower volumes (210 ) Higher selling prices 115 Higher costs (76 ) Lower asphalt mix and concrete earnings (48 ) Higher cement earnings 18 Higher selling, administrative and general expenses (53 ) Goodwill impairment cement (253 ) Gain on divestitures 74 Gain on 2007 sale of California real estate (44 ) Higher interest expense, net (128 ) All other 12 2008 $ 75 Lower aggregates earnings due to Lower volumes (334 ) Higher selling prices 48 Lower costs 21 Lower asphalt mix and concrete earnings (20 ) Lower cement earnings (20 ) Lower selling, administrative and general expenses 21 2008 goodwill impairment cement 253 Lower gain on sale of PPE and divestitures (67 ) All other 4 2009 $ ( 19 ) Operating results by segment We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have three reporting segments organized around our principal product lines: aggregates, asphalt mix and concrete, and cement. Management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level. Aggregates Revenues and Gross Profits in millions Page 27 Table of Contents Unit Shipments Selling Price Customer and internal1 tons, in millions Freight adjusted average sales price per ton 2 1 Represents tons shipped primarily to our downstream operations (e.g., asphalt mix and ready mixed concrete) 2 Freight adjusted sales price is calculated as total sales dollars (internal and external) less freight to remote distribution sites divided by total sales units (internal and external) Our year over year aggregates shipments declined 26% in 2009, 12% in 2008 and 9% in 2007. Most of our geographic markets reported double digit percentage declines in aggregates volumes in 2009. Pricing for our products remained strong and helped to partially offset the earnings effect of lower volumes. Our year over year pricing improved 3% in 2009, 7% in 2008 and 13% in 2007. We are tightly managing plant operating costs and overhead expenses as we continue to adjust our cost structure to match weak demand. We have limited operating hours, streamlined our work force, and focused on achieving production efficiencies at reduced operating rates in the face of a sharp decline in demand for our products. As a result, our cash earnings per ton of aggregates, while essentially flat compared to 2008 and 2007, is 45% higher than the 2005 level, which was a year of peak demand for aggregates. We will continue to manage controllable costs aggressively and to focus on cash margins and earnings. Asphalt mix and Concrete Revenues and Gross Profits in millions Shipments of asphalt mix declined 22% in 2009 compared to 2008 and declined by 9% in 2008 compared to 2007. Asphalt materials margins were higher than the prior year as slightly lower selling prices for asphalt mix were more than offset by a 29% decline in the costs for liquid asphalt. Ready mixed concrete shipments declined by 32% in 2009. From 2007 to 2008, the sharp increase in ready mixed concrete shipments resulted from the inclusion of a full year of sales from the acquired Florida Rock concrete operations. Ready mixed concrete pricing remained relatively flat during the three year period. Page 28 Table of Contents Cement Revenues and Gross Profits in millions Cement earnings declined from last year because of weaker sales volumes, slightly offset by lower energy costs. Cement pricing declined 1% year over year. We acquired the Cement segment in November 2007 as part of the Florida Rock acquisition, so we reported no comparable revenues or earnings for the first ten months of 2007. Selling, administrative and general expenses in millions Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) include $8.5 million in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008 of expenses for property donations recorded at fair value. The gains from these donations, which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value, are included in gain on sale of property, plant equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Excluding the effect of these property donations, SAG in 2009 declined $19.0 million, or 5.5%. The year over year decline is due mostly to reductions in employee related expenses which more than offset a year over year increase in project costs related to the replacement of legacy IT systems. Employment levels across Vulcan are down 12% from the prior year. The SAG increase in 2008 over 2007 was primarily attributable to including a full year of expenses for the former Florida Rock businesses. Employment levels in 2008 were down 14% from 2007. Goodwill impairment There were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2009 and 2007. During 2008, we recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our Cement segment in Florida, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit. We acquired these operations as part of the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007. For additional details regarding this impairment, see the Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Critical Accounting Policy. Page 29 Table of Contents Gain on sale of property, plant equipment and businesses, net in millions The 2009 gains were primarily related to sales and donations of real estate, mostly in California. Included in the 2008 gains was a $73.8 million pretax gain for quarry sites divested as a condition for approval by the Department of Justice of the Florida Rock acquisition. The 2007 gain includes a $43.8 million pretax gain on the sale of real estate in California. Interest expense in millions The increase in interest expense in 2009 and 2008 was due primarily to debt incurred for the acquisition of Florida Rock. Excluding capitalized interest credits, gross interest expense for 2009 was $186.0 million compared to $187.1 million in 2008 and $53.3 million in 2007. Income taxes Our income tax (benefit) provision for continuing operations for the years ended December 31 are shown below: in millions 2009 2008 2007 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (19.2 ) $ 75.1 $ 667.5 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (37.9 ) 71.7 204.4 Effective tax rate 197.0 % 95.5 % 30.6 % The change in our 2009 tax provision resulted from the relatively greater effect of certain items such as statutory depletion, undistributed earnings from foreign operations, loss on the sale of the stock of a subsidiary, and charitable contributions of property, coupled with the significantly lower level of earnings. The 2008 provision included the unfavorable impact of the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, the 2008 income tax provision for continuing operations was $96.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 29.5%.
