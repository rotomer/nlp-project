ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KEY DRIVERS OF VALUE CREATION * Source: Moodys Analytics FINANCIAL SUMMARY FOR 2010 Net earnings were a loss of $96.5 million or ($0.75) per diluted share EBITDA was $370.6 million compared to $548.4 million in 2009 Pretax charges of $43.0 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit in Illinois and a $39.5 million pretax gain associated with the sale of non strategic assets in rural Virginia Unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased 30% and 20%, respectively, reducing pretax earnings $51.3 million Freight adjusted selling prices for aggregates declined 2% due principally to weakness in Florida and California Aggregates shipments declined 2% reflecting varied market demand conditions across our footprint Full year capital spending was $86.3 million compared with $109.7 million in 2009 STABILIZING MARKETS IN 2010 In 2010, the year over year decline in trailing twelve month aggregates shipments slowed significantly from the prior three years. During the period from 2007 through 2009, aggregates shipments adjusted to include major acquisitions and exclude divestitures declined 11% in 2007, 21% in 2008 and 26% in 2009. In 2010, aggregates shipments declined only 2% from the prior year reflecting varied market demand conditions across our markets. Aggregates shipments in 2010 benefited from increased highway construction activity and some improvement in housing. New home construction declined to historically low levels in 2009. Then, after 43 consecutive months of year over year declines, single family housing starts Part II 25 Table of Contents began to improve in late 2009. By the end of 2010, full year single family housing starts, as measured by McGraw Hill Construction, had increased 2% from 2009 and multi family housing starts increased 8%. Tight credit has contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings, particularly stores and offices. However, the rate of decline in private nonresidential construction began to slow late in 2010. Construction activity funded by the public sector, typically less affected in economic cycles, increased in 2010 due mostly to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). During the twelve months ended December 2010, total contract awards for highway construction in Vulcan served states, including awards for federal, state and local projects, increased 5% from the prior year compared to a decrease of 2% for other states. The positive effects of ARRA spending in 2010 were somewhat offset by the failure of Congress to reauthorize the most recent multi year federal transportation bill known as SAFETEA LU, which expired on September 30, 2009. The federal transportation program was funded through a series of short term extensions in late 2009 and early 2010. Passage of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act in March 2010 included authorized funding for transportation programs through December 31, 2010. ARRA includes economic stimulus funding of $50 to $60 billion for heavy construction projects, including $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. Vulcan served states were apportioned 55% more funds than other states; with California, Texas and Florida receiving 23% of the total for highways and bridges. The challenge of meeting ARRA deadlines to ensure use of federal funds, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the regular federal highway bill, led many states to slow the pace of obligating new projects funded by regular federal funding for highways during the first nine months of fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. During the last three months of the fiscal year 2010, obligation of funds for projects was at record levels. According to the Federal Highway Administration, approximately $7.1 billion or 43% of the total stimulus funds apportioned for highways and bridges in Vulcan served states remains to be spent. The vast majority of this unspent amount, $5.4 billion, is located in Vulcans top 10 revenue producing states California, Virginia, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Alabama and South Carolina. The pace of obligating, bidding, awarding and starting stimulus related highway construction projects has varied widely across states. These state by state differences in awarding projects and spending patterns are due, in part, to the types of planned projects and to the proportion sub allocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming. We have worked diligently throughout this downturn to position our company for earnings growth when demand recovers. Improved stability in the economic factors that drive demand for our products will bring the strength of our fundamentals back into focus. Vulcan preserved reasonably stable aggregates pricing during the worst year of demand maintained productivity levels despite slightly lower sales volumes controlled selling, administrative and general expenses As a result of these efforts, cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in 2010 was 26% higher than at the peak of demand in 2005. Part II 26 Table of Contents RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not define free cash flow and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). Thus, they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by GAAP. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analysis, and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a companys ability to incur and service debt. We use free cash flow, EBITDA and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below: FREE CASH FLOW Free cash flow deducts purchases of property, plant equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. in millions 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $202.7 $453.0 $435.2 Purchases of property, plant equipment (86.3 ) (109.7 ) (353.2 ) Free cash flow $116.4 $343.3 $82.0 EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.

Aggregates 2. Concrete 3. Asphalt mix 4. Cement Intersegment sales consist of our Aggregates and Cement segments selling product to our Concrete segment and our Aggregates segment selling product to our Asphalt mix segment. We include intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment revenue at the product line level. These intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required. Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business. The following table shows net earnings in relationship to net sales, cost of goods sold, operating earnings and EBITDA. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Amounts in millions, except per share data For the years ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $2,405.9 $2,543.7 $3,453.1 Cost of goods sold 2,105.2 2,097.7 2,703.4 Gross profit $300.7 $446.0 $749.7 Operating earnings (loss) ($14.5 ) $148.5 $249.1 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes ($192.2 ) ($19.2 ) $75.1 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations ($102.5 ) $18.6 $3.4 Earnings (loss) on discontinued operations, net of income taxes 6.0 11.7 (2.5 ) Net earnings (loss) ($96.5 ) $30.3 $0.9 Basic earnings (loss) per share Continuing operations ($0.80 ) $0.16 $0.03 Discontinued operations 0.05 0.09 (0.02 ) Basic net earnings (loss) per share ($0.75 ) $0.25 $0.01 Diluted earnings (loss) per share Continuing operations ($0.80 ) $0.16 $0.03 Discontinued operations 0.05 0.09 (0.02 ) Diluted net earnings (loss) per share ($0.75 ) $0.25 $0.01 EBITDA (adjusted EBITDA in 2008) $370.6 $548.4 $886.5 The length and depth of the decline in construction activity and aggregates demand during this economic downturn have been unprecedented. Our aggregates shipments in 2010 were just over half the level shipped in 2005 when demand peaked. We continued to manage our business to maximize cash generation. In 2010, we again reduced inventory levels of aggregates. While this action negatively affected reported earnings, it increased cash generation and better positions us to increase production and earnings as demand recovers. We also continued to reduce our overhead expenses. Cost associated with implementing some of these reductions increased selling, administrative and general expense in 2010; however, the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in 2011 and beyond. Part II 28 Table of Contents The 2010 results include $43.0 million of pretax charges related to the settlement of a lawsuit with the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), a $39.5 million pretax gain associated with the sale of non strategic assets in rural Virginia and increased pretax costs of $51.4 million related to higher unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt. While we believed that the IDOT settlement was covered by insurance, we did not recognize its recovery as of December 31, 2010 due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of a recovery. However, in February 2011 we completed the first of two arbitrations in which two of our three insurers participated. The arbitration panel awarded us a total of $25.5 million in payment of their share of the settlement amount and attorneys fees. This award will be recorded as income in the first quarter of 2011. The 2008 results include a $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge for our Cement segment. The 2008 results also include a $73.8 million pretax gain from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval of the Florida Rock acquisition by the Department of Justice. Year over year changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: in millions 2008 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $75.1 Lower aggregates earnings due to Lower volumes (333.7 ) Higher selling prices 48.3 Lower costs 21.1 Lower concrete earnings (37.8 ) Higher asphalt mix earnings 17.9 Lower cement earnings (19.5 ) Lower selling, administrative and general expenses1 21.0 2008 goodwill impairment cement 252.7 Lower gain on sale of property, plant equipment and businesses (67.1 ) All other 2.8 2009 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes ($19.2 ) Lower aggregates earnings due to Lower volumes (20.6 ) Lower selling prices (25.1 ) Higher costs (27.4 ) Lower concrete earnings (30.5 ) Lower asphalt mix earnings (39.7 ) Lower cement earnings (2.0 ) Higher selling, administrative and general expenses1, 2 (2.9 ) Higher gain on sale of property, plant equipment and businesses 32.2 IDOT settlement, including related legal fees (43.0 ) Higher interest expense (6.3 ) All other (7.7 ) 2010 earnings from continuing operations before income taxes ($192.2 ) 1 Includes expenses for property donations recorded at fair value for each comparative year, as follows: $9.2 million in 2010, $8.5 million in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008. 2 Excludes $3.0 million of 2010 legal expenses charged to selling, administrative and general expenses which is noted in this table within the IDOT settlement line. OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines: 1) aggregates, 2) concrete, 3) asphalt mix and 4) cement. Management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level. Part II 29 Table of Contents 1. AGGREGATES Our year over year aggregates shipments declined 2% in 2010 26% in 2009 12% in 2008 To date, the economic recovery has not had a significant effect on some of our key end markets or key regional markets. As a result, market conditions varied across our markets throughout the year. Aggregates shipments declined sharply in certain markets such as North Carolina, Florida and Georgia, while shipments increased modestly in other markets such as South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Our year over year aggregates selling price declined 2% in 2010 improved 3% in 2009 improved 7% in 2008 Since 2006, our aggregates selling price has cumulatively increased 22%. The 2010 decline in aggregates selling price was due primarily to weakness in demand in Florida and California. In Florida, demand remained relatively weak throughout the year while demand for aggregates in California exhibited some modest growth in the fourth quarter versus 2009. AGGREGATES REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS AGGREGATES UNIT SHIPMENTS AGGREGATES SELLING PRICE Customer and internal1 tons, in millions Freight adjusted average sales price per ton2 We continued tight management of our controllable plant operating costs to match weak demand. The $73.1 million decline in gross profits resulted primarily from the 2% decreases in both freight adjusted selling prices and shipments, as well as a Part II 30 Table of Contents 30% increase in the unit cost of diesel fuel. Excluding the earnings effect of higher diesel fuel costs, unit cost of sales for aggregates increased modestly from 2009. 2. CONCRETE Our year over year ready mixed concrete shipments declined 5% in 2010 declined 32% in 2009 increased 150% in 2008 The 2008 year over year increase in ready mixed concrete shipments resulted from the November 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock and the resulting full year of shipments in 2008 versus only two months in 2007. The average selling price for ready mixed concrete declined 10% in 2010 and accounted for the year over year decline in this segments gross profit. Raw material costs were lower than 2009 and more than offset the effects of a 5% decline in shipments. CONCRETE REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS 3. ASPHALT MIX Our year over year asphalt mix shipments declined 3% in 2010 22% in 2009 9% in 2008 Asphalt mix segment earnings declined $39.7 million from 2009 due mostly to a 20% increase in the average unit cost for liquid asphalt. Higher liquid asphalt costs lowered segment earnings $27.1 million in 2010. The average selling price for asphalt mix declined 4% as selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag increasing liquid asphalt costs and were further held in check due to competitive pressures. Part II 31 Table of Contents ASPHALT MIX REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS 4. CEMENT The average unit selling price for cement decreased 17%, more than offsetting the earnings effect of a 32% increase in unit sales volumes. The increase in unit sales volumes was primarily attributable to an increase in intersegment sales. CEMENT REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL EXPENSES Additional costs associated with implementing some overhead expense reductions actually increased Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) expenses for 2010. However, the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in 2011 and beyond. On a comparable basis, SAG costs in 2010 were $4.1 million lower than 2009. Benefits related to our project to replace legacy IT systems began to be realized in 2010, reducing project costs for the year. We expect additional benefits from this project in 2011. The 2009 decline in SAG cost was due primarily to reductions in employee related expenses which more than offset a year over year increase in project costs for the replacement of legacy IT systems. Part II 32 Table of Contents SAG includes expenses for property donations recorded at fair value, as follows: $9.2 million in 2010, $8.5 million in 2009 and $10.5 million in 2008. The gains from these donations, which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value, are included in gain on sale of property, plant equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Excluding the effect of these property donations, SAG expenses increased $5.2 million in 2010 and decreased $19.0 million in 2009. Our year over year total company employment levels declined 4% in 2010 11% in 2009 14% in 2008 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT There were no charges for goodwill impairment in 2010 and 2009. During 2008, we recorded a $252.7 million pretax goodwill impairment charge related to our Cement segment, representing the entire balance of goodwill at this reporting unit. We acquired these operations as part of the Florida Rock transaction in November 2007. For additional details regarding this impairment, see the Goodwill and Goodwill Impairment Critical Accounting Policy. GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET The 2010 gain includes a $39.5 million pretax gain associated with the sale of non strategic assets in rural Virginia. The 2009 gain was primarily related to sales and donations of real estate, mostly in California. Included in the 2008 gains was a $73.8 million pretax gain for quarry sites divested as a condition for approval of the Florida Rock acquisition by the Department of Justice. INTEREST EXPENSE Excluding capitalized interest credits, gross interest expense for 2010 was $185.2 million compared to $186.0 million in 2009 and $187.1 million in 2008. Part II 33 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES Our income tax provision (benefit) for continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is shown below: dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes ($192.2 ) ($19.2 ) $75.1 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (89.7 ) (37.9 ) 71.7 Effective tax rate 46.6% 197.0% 95.5% The $51.8 million increase in our 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the increased loss from continuing operations. The $109.6 million increase in our 2009 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the 2009 loss from continuing operations, the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge taken in 2008 and the decrease in the state income tax provision offset in part by a decrease in the benefit for statutory depletion. A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to our effective tax rates for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is presented in Note 9, Income Taxes in
