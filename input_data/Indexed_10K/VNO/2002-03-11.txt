The Companys physical properties were not directly affected by the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001. Demand for New York City office space increased temporarily as a result of displaced tenants from buildings damaged or destroyed. The occupancy rate of the Companys New York City office portfolio increased from 95% at June 30, 2001 to 97% at December 31, 2001. The Company has experienced a significant reduction in occupancy at its Hotel Pennsylvania subsequent to September 11, 2001 accelerating a trend which began in the first quarter of 2001. Substantially all of the Companys office, retail and permanent showroom leases contain step ups in rent. Such rental increases are not designed to, and in many instances do not, approximate the cost of inflation, but do have the effect of mitigating the adverse impact of inflation. In addition, substantially all of the Companys leases contain provisions that require the tenant to reimburse the Company for the tenants share of common area charges (including roof and structure in strip shopping centers, unless it is the tenants direct responsibility) and real estate taxes or for increases of such expenses over a base amount, thus offsetting, in part, the effects of inflation on such expenses. 58 Below is a summary of net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Prior to 2001, income from the Companys preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially owned entities. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which provide services to the Companys business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001. Amounts for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as if consolidated as of January 1, 1999.

(2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $295,222 and 13.7% for the New York City office portfolio and $84,943 and 3.6% for the CESCR portfolio. (3) The Company reflects its 60% share of the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships ("the Landlord") equity in the rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. On February 22, 2001, the Landlord restructured the AmeriCold Logistics leases to among other things, (i) reduce 2001s contractual rent to $146,000, (ii) reduce 2002s contractual rent to $150,000 (plus additional contingent rent in certain circumstances), (iii) increase the Landlords share of annual maintenance capital expenditures by $4,500 to $9,500 effective January 1, 2000 and (iv) extend the deferred rent period to December 31, 2003 from March 11, 2002. The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 4.2% and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is lower than last year by $26,764 (a 14.4% decline). This decrease is attributable to a reduction in total customer inventory stored at the warehouses and customer inventory turns. Based on the Companys policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281 and $8,606 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to pay $39,812 of deferred rent of which the Companys share was $23,887. This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company. (4) Included in "Other" is $2,422 of interest income from the $31,424 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating"). Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer recognize the interest income due on the $31,424 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company. The Company anticipates that the leases with Vornado Operatings investee may be restructured to provide additional cash flow and Vornado Operatings investee may sell non core assets. 62 REVENUES The Companys revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements and other income were $985,773,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $926,151,000 in the prior year, an increase of $59,622,000.

INCOME APPLICABLE TO ALEXANDERS Income applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing and development fees, equity in income) was $24,548,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $17,363,000 in the prior year, an increase of $7,185,000. This increase resulted primarily from the Companys share of Alexanders gain on sale of its Fordham Road property on January 12, 2001. 64 INCOME FROM PARTIALLY OWNED ENTITIES In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reflects the income it receives from (i) entities it owns less than 50% of and (ii) entities it owns more than 50% of, but which have a partner who has the right to exercise significant control, on the equity method of accounting resulting in such income appearing on one line in the Companys consolidated statements of income.

This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of NorthStar subordinated unsecured debt (22% effective rate) on September 19, 2000 and a loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. on September 28, 2000 (20% effective rate). On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. The Company received a 1% upfront fee and is entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum. Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The Companys loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount. The loans are secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for the same number of shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the collateral. On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Companys net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000, including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed to them (all of such fees and interest accrued through November 19, 2001 are for the account of Vornado and all of such fees and interest accrued after November 19, 2001 accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim. The Company has agreed that in the event the Company acquires the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the request of Cadim, deliver 50% of such collateral to Cadim. For financial reporting purposes, the gross amount of the loan, $106,768,000, is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadims 50% participation, $50,000,000, is reflected in "Other liabilities". The Company did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November 19, 2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been consummated. The Company believes that the value of the collateral and the guarantees is sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the loans receivable including unpaid interest and fees. Included in interest and other investment income for the year ended December 31, 2001, is $2,422,000 of interest income from the $31,424,000 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating Company ("Vornado Operating"). Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer recognize the interest income due on the $31,424,000 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE Interest and debt expense was $173,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $179,380,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $6,304,000. This decrease resulted primarily from a $36,270,000 savings from a 289 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt partially offset by interest on higher average outstanding loan balances. Interest and debt expense includes amortization of debt issuance costs of $8,458,000 and $7,298,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. 66 NET GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF WHOLLY OWNED AND PARTIALLY OWNED ASSETS The following table sets forth the details of net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000: ($ in thousands) 2001 2000 WHOLLY OWNED ASSETS: Net gain from condemnation proceeding..................... $ 3,050 $ Write off of investments in technology companies..........

In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000. The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. WRITE OFF INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $4,723,000 resulting from the write off of an equity investment in a technology company. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of $13,561,000 resulting from the write off of all of its remaining equity investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market of certain of their products and services. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the technology companies access to its properties. 550/600 MAMARONECK AVENUE On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600 Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000, which approximated its net book value. NET GAIN ON SALE OF OTHER REAL ESTATE During 2000, the Company sold (i) its three shopping centers located in Texas for $25,750,000, resulting in a gain of $2,560,000 and (ii) its Westport, Connecticut office property for $24,000,000, resulting in a gain of $8,405,000. PARK LAUREL CONDOMINIUM PROJECT In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Park Laurel Joint Venture (69% owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000. The Companys share of the after tax net gain was $15,657,000 and is after a charge of $3,953,000 (net of tax benefit of $1,826,000) for awards accrued under the ventures incentive compensation plan. 570 LEXINGTON AVENUE On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain of $12,445,000. WRITE OFF OF NET INVESTMENT IN RTR In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote off its entire net investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate. 67 OTHER The Company recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $4,110,000 in the first quarter of 2001. The Company had previously marked to market changes in the value of stock purchase warrants through accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, those changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of income as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such securities will be recorded through earnings. The Company recorded an extraordinary item of $1,170,000 in the first quarter of 2001 representing the Companys share of Alexanders extraordinary gain from early extinguishment of debt. The Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $1,125,000 in the first quarter of 2000 due to the write off of unamortized financing costs in connection with the prepayment of debt. Minority interest was $112,363,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $102,374,000 for the prior year, an increase of $9,989,000. This increase is primarily due to an increase in perpetual preferred units distributions for units issued in 2000 and 2001. The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company has distributed to its shareholders an amount greater than its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. 68 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND DECEMBER 31, 1999 Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.

Prior to that date the Company reflected its equity in the operations. Total contractual rent was $35,672 and $160,494 for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2000, of which the tenant deferred $7,500 and $17,044.

The loan bears interest at 4.49% per annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006. The Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional loans on a revolving basis. Each additional loan will bear interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan. At December 31, 2001, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000.

Prior to November 30, 2001, the Company and Mr. Fascitelli have agreed to extend the deferral period for three additional years. The Company has funded the obligation in common shares. Accordingly, the Company has reflected this liability as Deferred compensation shares not yet delivered in the Equity section of the balance sheet. The cash and common shares are held in an irrevocable trust (the fair value of this obligation was $40,155,000 at December 31, 2001). For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized approximately $4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 and $1,968,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares in each period and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on the shares. On March 8, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period ending December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the employment agreement, he will receive a deferred payment in five years of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000. The number of shares was set by the Companys Compensation Committee in December to achieve a value of $25,000,000 and have appreciated $2,500,000 since then. The shares will vest on December 31, 2002. Mr. Fascitelli will also receive regular annual cash compensation as determined by the Companys Compensation Committee and will continue as a member of Vornados Board. One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant to an employment agreement of $1,000,000 at December 31, 2001.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the Revolving Credit Agreement during its term. The Revolving Credit Agreement prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2001, $31,424,000 was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Other The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc.

On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue to an entity controlled by Bernard Mendik, a former trustee and executive officer of the Company, for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain to the Company of $12,445,000. During 2001, the Company paid approximately $136,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Companys trustees is a member. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of various preferred stock affiliates which was owned by Officer and Trustees of the Company and converted them to taxable REIT subsidiaries.

There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of funds from operations. Funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers funds from operations a supplemental measure of operating performance and along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. Funds from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs since a number of REITs, including the Company, calculate funds from operations in a manner different from that used by NAREIT. Funds from operations, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items and gains or losses on sales of real estate. Funds from operations as disclosed above has been modified from this definition to adjust primarily for (i) the effect of straight lining of property rentals for rent escalations and leasing fee income, and (ii) the reversal of income taxes (benefit) which are considered non recurring because of the conversion of Temperature Controlled Logistics Companies to REITs in 2000.

Funds from operations per share would not change.

Smith Commercial Realty as if it had occurred on January 1, 2000. 83 ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ACQUISITION ACTIVITY On January 1, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 66% of CESCR it did not previously own. The consideration for the remaining 66% of CESCR was approximately $1,600 million, consisting of 15.7 million newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units (valued at $608 million) and acquiring the assets subject to $992 million of debt (66% of CESCRs total debt). CESCR owns and manages 12.9 million square feet office properties in Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia and manages an additional 5.8 million square feet of office and other commercial properties in the Washington D.C. area. The Companys future success will be affected by its ability to integrate the assets and businesses it acquires and to effectively manage those assets and businesses. The Company currently expects to continue to grow. However, its ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including, among others, (a) the availability of reasonably priced assets that meet the Companys acquisition criteria and (b) the price of the Companys common shares, the rates at which the Company is able to borrow money and, more generally, the availability of financing on terms that, in the Companys view, make such acquisitions financially attractive. CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS For 2002, the Company has budgeted approximately $172.6 million for capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) and leasing commissions as follows: ($ in thousands) Temperature New York CESCR Merchandise Controlled Total Office Office Retail Mart Logistics Other Capital Expenditures: Expenditures to maintain the assets: Recurring.................. $ 37,500 $ 8,300 $ 11,600 $ 4,700 $ 5,000 $ 5,700(1) $ 2,200(2) Non recurring.............. 46,500 20,300 17,200 9,000 84,000 28,600 28,800 4,700 14,000 5,700 2,200 Tenant improvements: Recurring.................. 56,000 12,100 30,300 13,600 Non recurring.............. 9,900 9,900 65,900 22,000 30,300 13,600 Total......................... $ 149,900 $ 50,600 $ 59,100 $ 4,700 $ 27,600 5,700 $ 2,200 Leasing Commissions: Recurring.................. $ 16,400 $ 6,200 $ 7,600 $ $ 2,600 $ $ Non recurring.............. 6,300 6,300 $ 22,700 $ 12,500 $ 7,600 $ $ 2,600 $ $ Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions: Recurring.................. $ 109,900 $ 26,600 $ 49,500 $ 4,700 $ 21,200 $ 5,700 $ 2,200 Non recurring.............. 62,700 36,500 17,200 9,000 Tenant allowances and leasing commissions for the New York City Office properties approximate $23.00 per square foot for renewal space and $48.00 per square foot for vacant space. Historically, approximately two thirds of existing tenants renew their leases. (1) Represents the Companys 60% share of the Vornado/Crescent Partnerships obligation to fund $9,500 of capital expenditures per annum. (2) Primarily for the Hotel Pennsylvania. In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in or considering certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $158.4 million to be expended as outlined in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1 Business. The $158.4 million does not include amounts for other projects which are also included in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1 Business, as no budgets for them have been finalized. There can be no assurance that any of the above projects will be ultimately completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount. No cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures and amortization of debt of Alexanders, or The Newkirk MLP, which are partially owned by the Company. These investees are expected to fund their own cash requirements. Alexanders is prohibited by its loan agreements from paying dividends. In 2002 the Company expects to receive distributions of approximately $44.2 million from its investment in The Newkirk MLP, including the distribution of approximately $37 million received on February 6, 2002, in connection with a Newkirk refinancing. 84 FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Below is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2001: ($ in thousands) Less Than 1 3 4 5 Total 1 Year Years Years Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations: Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility $ $ $ $ $ Mortgages and Notes Payable ........ 2,477,173 834,008 585,866 105,000 952,299 Operating Leases ................... 449,783 14,442 26,791 26,177 382,373 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $2,926,956 $ 848,450 $612,657 $131,177 $1,334,672 Commitments: Standby Letters of Credit .......... $ 83,238 $ 83,238 $ $ $ Guarantees ......................... Total Commitments ................ $ 83,238 $ 83,238 $ $ $ The Company is reviewing various alternatives for the repayment or refinancing of debt coming due during 2002. The Company has $1 billion available under its revolving credit facility which matures in March, 2003 and a number of properties which are unencumbered. The Companys credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization. The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Companys ratings below Baa3/BBB. This facility also contains customary events of default which could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage. The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets. The Companys all risk insurance policies in effect before September 11, 2001 included coverage for terrorist acts, except for acts of war. Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies are excluding terrorists acts from coverage in all risk policies. In 2002, the Company has been unable to obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorists acts for policies it has renewed including the New York City Office portfolio and may not be able to obtain such coverage for any of its other properties in the future. Therefore, the risk of financial loss in the case of terrorist acts is the Companys, which loss could be material. The Companys debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non recourse to the Company) and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt. In addition, if lenders insist on coverage for these risks, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to finance and or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio. In addition, many of the Companys non recourse mortgages contain debt service covenants which if not satisfied could require cash collateral. These covenants are not "ratings" related. CORPORATE On September 20, 2001, the Company sold an aggregate of $45,000,000 8.25% Series D 9 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units resulting in net proceeds of approximately $43,875,000. On November 19, 2001, the Company sold 9,775,000 common shares pursuant to an effective registration statement based on the closing price of $40.58 on the NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $377,200,000. In connection therewith the Company repaid the $285,000,000 then outstanding under its revolving credit facility. On February 25, 2002, the Company sold 884,543 common shares to a closed end fund and 514,200 shares to a unit investment trust based on the closing price of $42.96 on the NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $57,042,000. 85 OFFICE On January 11, 2001, the Company completed a $105,000,000 refinancing of its 888 Seventh Avenue office building. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.6% and matures on January 1, 2006. A portion of the proceeds received were used to repay the then existing mortgage of $55,000,000. MERCHANDISE MART On October 16, 2001, the Company completed a $49,000,000 refinancing of its Washington Design Center property. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.95% and matures on October 16, 2011. A portion of the proceeds received were used to repay the then existing mortgage of $23,000,000. On July 11, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000,000 refinancing of its Market Square Complex. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.95% and matures in July 2011. The proceeds received were used to repay the then existing mortgage of $49,000,000. OTHER On September 20, 2001, the Company completed a $50,000,000 mortgage financing, cross collateralized by its eight industrial warehouse properties. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.95% per annum and matures on October 1, 2011. On February 1, 2002, the Newkirk MLP, in which the Company has a 21.1% interest, completed a $225,000,000 mortgage financing collateralized by its properties, subject to the existing first and certain second mortgages on those properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5% with a LIBOR floor of 3.0% (8.5% at February 1, 2002) and matures on January 31, 2005, with two one year extension options. The Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $940,000,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $1.0 billion of debt securities. The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations will be adequate to fund business operations and the payment of dividends and distributions on an on going basis for more than the next twelve months; however, capital outlays for significant acquisitions will require funding from borrowings or equity offerings. 86 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statement requires that changes in the derivative instruments fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Companys investment securities include stock purchase warrants received from companies that provide fiber optic network and broadband access to the Companys Office division tenants. Statement 133 requires these warrants to be marked to market at each reporting period with the change in value recognized currently in earnings. The Company has previously marked to market changes in value through accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under Statement 133, those changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such securities will be recorded through earnings. The Company does not currently utilize derivatives for hedging purposes and does not engage in speculative activities. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (effective July 1, 2001) and SFAS No. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 141 prohibits pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company will write off goodwill of approximately $32,491,000, of which (i) $18,000,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Companys investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,491,000 represents goodwill arising from the Companys acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania. The write off will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Amortization of goodwill during 2001 was approximately $1,116,000. In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG LIVED ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred. SFAS No. 144 supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of these statements will have a material effect on the Companys financial statements; however under SFAS No. 144, if the Company were to dispose of a material operating property, such propertys results of operations will have to be separately disclosed as discontinued operations in the Companys financial statements. 87 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly owned and partially owned debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 Weighted Effect of 1% Weighted December 31, Average Change In December 31, Average Balance Interest Rate Base Rates Balance Interest Rate Wholly owned debt: Variable rate.................. $ 1,182,605 3.39% $ 10,591(1) $ 1,625,162 8.00% Fixed rate..................... 1,294,568 7.53% 1,063,146 7.61% $ 2,477,173 10,591 $ 2,688,308 Partially owned debt: Variable rate.................. $ 85,516 5.63% 855 $ 174,622 8.40% Fixed rate..................... 1,234,019 8.29% 1,123,926 8.63% $ 1,319,535 855 $ 1,298,548 Minority interest..................... (1,660) Total decrease in the Companys annual net income......... $ 9,786 Per share diluted................ $ .11 (1) Excludes the effect of a $123,500 mortgage financing, cross collateralized by the Companys 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue office properties, as the proceeds are in a restricted mortgage escrow account which bears interest at the same rate as the loan. Various financial instruments exist which could be employed to reduce the Companys exposure to change in interest rates. The Company does not currently utilize such hedging strategies. The fair value of the Companys debt at December 31, 2001, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt approximates its carrying value. 88
