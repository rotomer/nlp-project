Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflect the Companys January 1, 2002 acquisition of the remaining 66% of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") and the resulting consolidation of CESCRs operations. See Supplemental Information, page 82, for Condensed Pro Forma Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2001 giving effect to the CESCR acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2001. 59 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Companys accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. REAL ESTATE Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys carrying amount of its real estate, net of accumulated depreciation is $6.8 billion. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements and acquired above and below market leases and the origination cost of acquired in place leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141) and acquired liabilities, and allocate purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The Companys properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Companys financial statements. NOTES AND MORTGAGE LOANS RECEIVABLE The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its notes and mortgage loans receivable ($86.6 million as of December 31, 2002) if circumstances warrant to determine whether it is impaired. If the Company fails to identify that the investee or borrower are unable to perform, the Companys bad debt expense may be different. PARTIALLY OWNED ENTITIES The Company accounts for its investments in partially owned entities ($997.7 million as of December 31, 2002) under the equity method when the Companys ownership interest is more than 20% but less than 50% and the Company does not exercise direct or indirect control. When partially owned investments are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced. Factors that the Company considers in determining whether or not it exercises control include substantive participating rights of partners on significant business decisions, including dispositions and acquisitions of assets, financing and operating and capital budgets, board and management representation and authority and other contractual rights of its partners. To the extent that the Company is deemed to control these entities, these entities would have to be consolidated and therefore impact the balance sheet, operations and related ratios. On a periodic basis the Company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys investments in partially owned entities are impaired. An investment is impaired if managements estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying amount. The ultimate realization of the Companys investment in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions. If the Company determines that a decline in the value of its investee is other than temporary, then an impairment charge would be recorded. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement. The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents. This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. If estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results. 60 REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rents income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases. Percentage Rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with SAB 101, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenues income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Show Revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursement Income income arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses among other things, its collectibility. If the Company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue, its net income and assets could be overstated. INCOME TAXES The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, it would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result. 61 Below is a summary of Net income and Adjusted EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Prior to 2001, income from the Companys preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially owned entities. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the management companies (which provide services to the Companys business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001. Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as if consolidated as of January 1, 2000 (see page 64 for the details of the reclassifications by line item). In addition, the Company has revised Adjusted EBITDA as previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to include income from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,170,000 in 2001 and expense from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,125,000 in 2000 because such items are no longer treated as extraordinary items in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Prior to 2001, income from the Companys investments in preferred stock affiliates ("PSAs") was included in income from partially owned entities. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of its PSAs and converted these entities to taxable REIT subsidiaries. Accordingly, the operations of the Hotel portion of the Hotel Pennsylvania and the operations of the management companies (which provide services to the Companys business segments and operate the Trade Show business of the Merchandise Mart division) have been consolidated effective January 1, 2001. Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 have been reclassified to give effect to the consolidation of these entities, as of January 1, 2000. The effect of these reclassifications in 2000 was as follows: (i) reduction in equity in income of partially owned entities $ (8,599,000) (ii) increase in rental revenues 64,501,000 (iii) increase in other income 8,325,000 (iv) increase in operating expenses (41,233,000) (v) increase in depreciation and amortization (6,906,000) (vi) increase in general and administrative expenses (6,984,000) (vii) increase in interest and debt expense (9,104,000) (viii) net impact $ These reclassifications had no effect on reported Net Income or Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2000 and no impact to any other year. 64 NOTES: (1) Adjusted EBITDA represents income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, extraordinary or non recurring items, gains or losses on sales of depreciable real estate, the effect of straight lining of rent escalations, amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases and minority interest. Management considers Adjusted EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the performance of its segments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income or a substitute for cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a measure of "operating performance" which enables the reader to identify trends from period to period and may be used to compare "same store" operating performance to other companies, as well as providing a measure for determining funds available to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, the Company has revised Adjusted EBITDA as previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 to include income from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,170 in 2001 and expense from the early extinguishment of debt of $1,125 in 2000 because such items are no longer treated as Extraordinary Items in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

INCOME APPLICABLE TO ALEXANDERS Income applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $29,653,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $25,718,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $3,935,000. This increase resulted from (i) $6,915,000 of development and commitment fees in connection with Alexanders Lexington Avenue development project, (ii) the Companys $3,524,000 share of Alexanders gain on sale of its Third Avenue property, partially offset by (iii) the Companys $6,298,000 share of Alexanders gain on the sale of its Fordham Road property in the prior year. 67 INCOME FROM PARTIALLY OWNED ENTITIES In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company reflects the income it receives from (i) entities it owns less than 50% of and (ii) entities it owns more than 50% of, but which have a partner who has shared board and management representation and authority and substantive participating rights on all significant business decisions, on the equity method of accounting resulting in such income appearing on one line in the Companys consolidated statements of income.

Accordingly, CESCR is consolidated as of January 1, 2002. (2) On September 20, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of the Mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store that it did not previously own. Accordingly, Las Catalinas is consolidated for the period from September 20, 2002 to December 31, 2002. (3) On October 10, 2002, a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50% interest, acquired the Monmouth Mall. (4) Vornados interest in the equity in net income of the Monmouth Mall includes a preferred return of $748 for the year ended December 31, 2002. (5) The prior year includes $1,394 for the Companys share of a gain on sale of a property. (6) The year ended December 31, 2002 excludes 570 Lexington Avenue which was sold in May 2001. (7) The prior year includes $2,000 for the Companys share of equity in loss of its Russian Tea Room ("RTR") investment. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote off its entire net investment in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate. 68 INTEREST AND OTHER INVESTMENT INCOME Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $31,685,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $54,385,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $22,700,000. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of (i) $12,347,000 due to the non recognition of income on the mortgage loan to Primestone, which was foreclosed on April 30, 2002, (ii) $4,626,000 due to a lower yield on the investment of the proceeds received from the May 2002 repayment of the Companys loan to NorthStar Partnership L.P. (22% yield in 2001) and (iii) $2,269,000 due to the non recognition of income on the loan to Vornado Operating. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE Interest and debt expense was $239,525,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $173,076,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $66,449,000. This increase was comprised of (i) $100,013,000 from the acquisition of the remaining 66% of CESCR and the resulting consolidation of its operations, partially offset by (ii) a $32,035,000 savings from a 202 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rates of the Companys variable rate debt and (iii) lower average outstanding debt balances. NET (LOSS) GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF WHOLLY OWNED AND PARTIALLY OWNED ASSETS OTHER THAN DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE The following table sets forth the details of net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001: For the Year Ended December 31, (amounts in thousands) 2002 2001 Wholly owned Assets: Gain on transfer of mortgages........................................... $ 2,096 $ Gain on sale of Kinzie Park condominiums units.......................... 2,156 Net gain on sale of air rights.......................................... 1,688 Net gain on sale of marketable securities............................... 12,346 Primestone foreclosure and impairment losses............................

Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Companys obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages. The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans. GAIN ON SALE OF KINZIE PARK CONDOMINIUM UNITS The Company recognized a gain of $2,156,000 during 2002, from the sale of residential condominiums in Chicago, Illinois. NET GAIN ON SALE OF AIR RIGHTS The Company recognized a net gain of $1,688,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10 K for further details. 69 PRIMESTONE FORECLOSURE AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. ("Primestone"). The Company received a 1% up front fee and was entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan. The loan bore interest at 16% per annum. Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Companys collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount. The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone. On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Companys net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. The participation did not meet the criteria for "sale accounting" under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets. Accordingly, the Company was required to account for this transaction as a borrowing secured by the loan, rather than as a sale of the loan by classifying the participation as an "Other Liability" and continuing to report the outstanding loan balance at 100% in "Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable" on the balance sheet. Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, and then to interest and fees owed to the Company through November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim, pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed following November 19, 2001 and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim as recovery of principal. On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction. The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestones indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange. On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim. In the second quarter, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2002 and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees. The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the stock has been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2002, the Companys carrying amount of the investment was $23,908,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, partially offset by $1,005,000 representing the Companys share of Prime Group Realtys net loss through September 30, 2002 (see Note 4. Investments in and Advances to Partially Owned Entities). At February 3, 2003, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $5.30 per share. The ultimate realization of the Companys investment will depend upon the future performance of the Chicago real estate market and the performance of PGE, as well as the ultimate realizable value of the net assets supporting the guarantees and the Companys ability to collect under the guarantees. In addition, the Company will continue to monitor this investment to determine whether additional write downs are required based on (i) declines in value of the shares of PGE (for which the partnership units are exchangeable) which are "other than temporary" as used in accounting literature and (ii) the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees. 70 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002, the Company wrote off all of the goodwill associated with the Hotel Pennsylvania and the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses aggregating $30,129,000. This write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002. MINORITY INTEREST Minority interest was $140,584,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $112,363,000 for the prior year, an increase of $28,221,000. This increase is primarily due to operating partnership units issued in connection with acquisitions. ADJUSTED EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in Adjusted EBITDA. Temperature Merchandise Controlled Total Office Retail Mart Logistics Other ($in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2001.......... $ 785,052 $ 379,800 $ 119,149 $ 110,802 $ 78,437 $ 96,864 2002 Operations: Same store operations(1)........... 1,811 18,165 (3,131)(3) (1,354)(5) (6,613)(6) (5,256)(7) Acquisitions, dispositions and non recurring income and expenses......................... 134,142 175,360 (3,286)(4) (570) (37,362)(8) Year ended December 31, 2002.......... $ 921,005 $ 573,325(2) $ 112,732 $ 108,878 $ 71,824 $ 54,246 % increase (decrease) in same store operations................. .2% 4.8%(2) (2.6%)(3) (1.2%)(5) (8.4%)(6) (5.4%)(7) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses. (2) Adjusted EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $303,368 and 5.0% for the New York City office portfolio and $269,957 and 4.1% for the CESCR portfolio. (3) Primarily due to lower occupancy and increases in allowances for bad debt expense as a result of the K Mart and other bankruptcies and the expiration of the Stop & Shop guarantees of several former Bradlees locations. Average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 88.3% (84.0% excluding leases which have not commenced as described in the following sentences) as compared to 92% at December 31, 2001. The 88.3% occupancy rate includes leases for 490,000 square feet at five locations which have not commenced as of December 31, 2002. Three of these locations aggregating 268,000 square feet are ground leased to Lowes which plans to demolish the existing buildings and construct its own stores at the sites and two locations containing 223,000 square feet are leased to Wal Mart, which plans to demolish an existing building and construct its own store at one of the sites and occupy the existing store at the other site. All of these redevelopment projects are subject to governmental approvals and in some cases, the relocation of existing tenants. (4) Primarily due to the Companys share of losses from the Starwood Ceruzzi venture in 2002 of $1,416 (before depreciation) from properties placed in service, as compared to a gain of $1,394 from the sale of one of the ventures assets in 2001. Adjusted EBITDA aggregating $2,600 from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall and the remaining 50% interest in the Las Catalinas Mall the Company did not previously own, was offset by lease termination fees and other refunds in the fourth quarter of 2001. (5) The net of a $1,685 or 1.5% same store increase in the core portfolio and a $3,300 or a 66% decline at the LA Mart as a result of rent reductions and increased marketing expenditures. (6) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships ("the Landlord") rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize its $19,349 share of the rent the joint venture was due for the year ended December 31, 2002. The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by .1%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period decreased by $614 (a .001% decrease). The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a reduction in customer inventory turns, a rate reduction with a significant customer and temporary plant shut downs. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher insurance and workers compensation. In addition, the tenants cash requirements for capital expenditures, debt service and a non recurring pension funding were $8,293 higher in the current year than in the prior year, which impacted the ability of the tenant to pay rent. (7) The decrease in same store operations was primarily due to (i) a $14,973 reduction in investment income and (ii) a $9,342 reduction in operating results at the Hotel Pennsylvania, partially offset by (iii) additional development and commitment fees from Alexanders and (iv) income from the Newkirk MLP. The reduction in investment income is primarily due to the reinvestment of the proceeds received from the repayment of the Companys $75,000 loan to NorthStar Partnership LP. in May 2002 at lower yields (1.5% vs. 22%) and not recognizing income on the Companys foreclosed loan to Primestone and outstanding loan to Vornado Operating. The Hotel Pennsylvanias operating results reflect a reduction in average occupancy and REVPAR to 65% and $58 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 63% and $70 for the year ended December 31, 2001. (8) Reflects net non recurring items included in Adjusted EBITDA (see page 65 footnote 2 for details) 71 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUES The Companys revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements and other income, were $985,773,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $926,151,000 in the prior year, an increase of $59,622,000.

This increase resulted primarily from the Companys share of Alexanders gain on sale of its Fordham Road property on January 12, 2001. 73 INCOME FROM PARTIALLY OWNED ENTITIES In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company reflects the income it receives from (i) entities it owns less than 50% of and (ii) entities it owns more than 50% of, but which have a partner who has shared board and management representation and authority and substantive participating rights on all significant business decisions, on the equity method of accounting resulting in such income appearing on one line in the Companys consolidated statements of income.

This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of NorthStar subordinated unsecured debt (22% effective rate) on September 19, 2000 and a loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. on September 28, 2000 (20% effective rate). On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. The Company received a 1% upfront fee and is entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum. Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The Companys loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Companys collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount. The loans are secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE), which units are exchangeable for the same number of shares of PGE. The loans are also guaranteed by affiliates of the borrower. The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings with respect to the collateral. On November 19, 2001 the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Companys net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. Under the terms of the participation agreement, cash payments received shall be applied (i) first, to the reimbursement of reimbursable out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing, administration or enforcement of the loans after November 19, 2001, (ii) second, to the Company and Cadim pro rata in proportion to the amount of interest and fees owed to them (all of such fees and interest accrued through November 19, 2001 are for the account of Vornado and all of such fees and interest accrued after November 19, 2001 accrue on a 50/50 basis to the Company and Cadim) and (iii) third, 50% to the Company and 50% to Cadim. The Company has agreed that in the event the Company acquires the collateral in a foreclosure proceeding it will, upon the request of Cadim, deliver 50% of such collateral to Cadim. For financial reporting at December 31, 2002, purposes, the gross amount of the loan, $106,768,000, is included in "Notes and mortgage loans receivable" and Cadims 50% participation, $50,000,000, is reflected in "Other liabilities". The Company did not recognize income on these loans for the period from November 19, 2001 through December 31, 2001, and will not recognize income until such time that cash is received or foreclosure proceedings have been consummated. Included in interest and other investment income for the year ended December 31, 2001, is $2,422,000 of interest income from the $31,424,000 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer recognize the interest income due on the $31,424,000 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE Interest and debt expense was $173,076,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $180,505,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $7,429,000. This decrease resulted primarily from a $36,270,000 savings from a 289 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt partially offset by interest on higher average outstanding loan balances. Interest and debt expense includes amortization of debt issuance costs of $8,458,000 and $8,423,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. 75 NET LOSS ON DISPOSITION OF WHOLLY OWNED AND PARTIALLY OWNED ASSETS OTHER THAN DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE The following table sets forth the details of net loss on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the year ended December 31, 2001 (no gains/losses in 2000): ($ in thousands) WHOLLY OWNED ASSETS: Write off of investments in technology companies.......... $ (16,513) PARTIALLY OWNED ASSETS: After tax net gain on sale of Park Laurel condominium units 15,657 Write off of net investment in the Russian Tea Room ("RTR") (7,374) Other...................................................... 160 $ (8,070) WRITE OFF INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $4,723,000 resulting from the write off of an equity investment in a technology company. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an additional charge of $13,561,000 resulting from the write off of all of its remaining equity investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market of certain of their products and services. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the technology companies access to its properties. AFTER TAX NET GAIN ON SALE OF PARK LAUREL CONDOMINIUM UNITS In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Park Laurel Joint Venture (69% interest owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000. The Companys share of the after tax net gain was $15,657,000 and is after a charge of $3,953,000 (net of tax benefit of $1,826,000) for awards accrued under the ventures incentive compensation plan. WRITE OFF OF NET INVESTMENT IN RTR In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote off its entire net investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate. GAINS ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Companys property. In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000. The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600 Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000, which approximated its net book value. On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain of $12,445,000. During 2000, the Company sold (i) its three shopping centers located in Texas for $25,750,000, resulting in a gain of $2,560,000 and (ii) its Westport, Connecticut office property for $24,000,000, resulting in a gain of $8,405,000. 76 OTHER The Company recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $4,110,000 in the first quarter of 2001. The Company had previously marked to market changes in the value of stock purchase warrants through accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, those changes are recognized through earnings, and accordingly, the Company has reclassified $4,110,000 from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statement of income as of January 1, 2001. Future changes in value of such securities will be recorded through earnings. Minority interest was $112,363,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $102,374,000 for the prior year, an increase of $9,989,000. This increase is primarily due to an increase in perpetual preferred units distributions for units issued in 2000 and 2001. ADJUSTED EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in Adjusted EBITDA. ($ in thousands) Temperature Merchandise Controlled Total Office Retail Mart Logistics Other Year ended December 31, 2000 $ 737,750 $ 331,025 $ 120,661 $ 91,858 $ 93,160 $ 101,046 2001 Operations: Same store operations(1)........ 32,485 37,731 3,305 7,508 (14,723)(3) (1,336) Acquisitions, dispositions and non recurring income and expenses...................... 14,817 11,044 (4,817) 11,436 (2,846) Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 785,052 $ 379,800(2) $ 119,149 $ 110,802 $ 78,437 $ 96,864(4) % increase (decrease) in same store operations.............. 4.4% 11.4%(2) 2.7% 8.2% (15.8%)(3) (1.3%)(4) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year. (2) Adjusted EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $295,222 and 13.7% for the New York City office portfolio and $84,943 and 3.6% for the CESCR portfolio. (3) The tenant has reported that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 4.2% and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is lower than last year by $26,764 (a 14.4% decline). This decrease is attributable to a reduction in total customer inventory stored at the warehouses and customer inventory turns. Based on the Landlords policy of recognizing rental income when earned and collection is assured or cash is received, the Company did not recognize $15,281 and $8,606 of the rent it was due in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. On December 31, 2001 the Landlord released the tenant from its obligation to pay $39,812 of deferred rent of which the Companys share was $23,887. This amount equals the rent which was not recognized as income by the Company and accordingly had no profit and loss effect to the Company. (4) Included in "Other" is $2,422 of interest income from the $31,424 note receivable the Company has from Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating has only one significant asset, its investment in AmeriCold Logistics and does not generate positive cash flow sufficient to cover all of its expenses. Accordingly, commencing January 1, 2002, the Company no longer recognizes interest income due on the $31,424 loan until Vornado Operating is cash flow positive in an amount sufficient to fund the interest due to the Company. 77 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2001 Below is a summary of Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a measure of "operating performance" which enables the reader to identify trends from period to period and may be used to compare "same store" operating performance to other companies, as well as providing a measure for determining funds available to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA and same store percentage increase was $75,303 and 3.8% for the New York City office portfolio and $69,396 and 3.6% for the CESCR portfolio. (3) Primarily due to lower occupancy and increases in allowances for bad debt expense as a result of the K Mart and other bankruptcies and the expiration of the Stop & Shop guarantees of several former Bradlees locations. Average occupancy for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 was 86%, (82% excluding leases which have not commenced) as compared to 92% at December 31, 2001. (4) Primarily due to Adjusted EBITDA aggregating $2,600 from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall and the remaining 50% interest in the Las Catalinas Mall the Company did not previously own, offset by lease termination fees and other refunds in the fourth quarter of 2001. (5) Primarily due to rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2003. (6) Primarily due to the reinvestment of the proceeds received from the repayment of the Companys $75,000 loan to NorthStar Partnership L.P. in May 2002 at lower yields and from not recognizing income on the Companys foreclosed loan to Primestone and loan to Vornado Operating. (7) Reflects net non recurring items included in Adjusted EBITDA. In comparing the financial results of the Companys segments on a quarterly basis, the following should be noted: The third quarter financial results of the Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically been impacted by higher net utility costs than in each other quarter of the year; The fourth quarter financial results of the Retail segment have historically been higher than the first three quarters due to the recognition of percentage rental income in that quarter; and The second and fourth quarter financial results of the Merchandise Mart segment have historically been higher than the first and third quarters due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters.

SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT COVENANT COMPLIANCE RATIOS The following ratios as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2002, are computed pursuant to the covenants and definitions of the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007. Actual Required Total Outstanding Debt/Total Assets....................... 48% Less than 60% Secured Debt/Total Assets................................. 43% Less than 55% Interest coverage (Annualized Combined EBITDA to Annualized Interest Expense)....................................... 2.97 Greater than 1.50 Unencumbered Assets/ Unsecured Debt....................... 674% Greater than 150% The covenants and definitions of the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007 are described in Exhibit 4.2 to the quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the three months ended September 30, 2002. 82 RELATED PARTIES LOAN AND COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS At December 31, 2002, the loan due from Mr. Roth, in accordance with his employment arrangement, was $13,122,500 ($4,704,500 of which is shown as a reduction in shareholders equity). The loan bears interest at 4.49 % per annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006. The Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional loans on a revolving basis. Each additional loan will bear interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan. On May 29, 2002, Mr. Roth replaced common shares of the Company securing the Companys outstanding loan to Mr. Roth with options to purchase common shares of the Company with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Roth supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities. At December 31, 2002, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000. The loans, which were scheduled to mature in 2003, have been extended to 2006 in connection with the extension of Mr. Fascitellis employment agreement (discussed below) and bear interest, payable quarterly at a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate). Pursuant to his 1996 employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli became entitled to a deferred payment consisting of $5 million in cash and a convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the Companys option, in either 919,540 Company common shares or the cash equivalent of their appreciated value, so long as such appreciated value is not less than $20 million. The Company delivered 919,540 shares to a rabbi trust upon execution of the 1996 employment agreement. The Company accounted for the stock compensation as a variable arrangement in accordance with Plan B of EITF No. 97 14 "Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested" as the agreement permitted settlement in either cash or common shares. Following the guidance in EITF 97 14, the Company recorded changes in fair value of its compensation obligation with a corresponding increase in the liability "Officers Deferred Compensation". Effective as of June 7, 2001, the payment date was deferred until November 30, 2004. Effective as of December 14, 2001, the payment to Mr. Fascitelli was converted into an obligation to deliver a fixed number of shares (919,540 shares), establishing a measurement date for the Companys stock compensation obligation, accordingly the Company ceased accounting for the Rabbi Trust under Plan B of the EITF and began Plan A accounting. Under Plan A, the accumulated liability representing the value of the shares on December 14, 2001, was reclassified as a component of Shareholders Equity as "Deferred compensation shares earned but not yet delivered." In addition, future changes in the value of the shares are no longer recognized as additional compensation expense. The fair value of this obligation was $34,207,000 at December 31, 2002. The Company has reflected this liability as Deferred Compensation Shares Not Yet Delivered in the Shareholders Equity section of the balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized approximately $4,744,000 and $3,733,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 and $1,968,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares in each period and $2,132,000 and $1,765,000 represented dividends paid on the shares. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed). The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002. The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares. The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense. Pursuant to the Companys annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due January 1, 2006. The loan, which was funded on July 23, 2002, was made in conjunction with Mr. Macnows June 2002 exercise of options to purchase 225,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The loan is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. As a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Macnow supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities. One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant to an employment agreement totaling $1,500,000 at December 31, 2002. The loan matures in April 2005 and bears interest at the applicable Federal rate provided (4.5% at December 31, 2002). 83 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES OF THE COMPANY Alexanders The Company owns 33.1% of Alexanders. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexanders, the Company provides various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexanders aggregating $119,000,000 at December 31, 2002. These agreements and the loans are described in Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements Investments in Partially Owned Entities in this annual report on form 10 K. The Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low income residential housing development (the "30th Street Venture"), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as "air rights". The Company donated the building to a charitable organization. The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot. An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexanders at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexanders 59th Street development project (the "59th Street Project"). In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights. The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights related to the 30th Street Venture. These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low income housing and community facility project. The 30th Street Venture asked Alexanders to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights. In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexanders for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot). Alexanders then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot). Interstate Properties The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, $1,450,000, $1,655,000, and $1,418,000 of management fees were earned by the Company pursuant to the management agreement. Building Maintenance Service Company ("BMS") On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services primarily to the Companys Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including Mr. Greenbaum, one of the Companys executive officers. The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, $51,280,000, and $47,493,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 for services rendered at the Companys Manhattan office properties. Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company. Vornado Operating Company and AmeriCold Logistics In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which expires on December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the revolving credit facility during its term. The revolving credit facility prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2002, $21,989,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 84 Vornado Operating has disclosed that in the aggregate its investments do not, and for the foreseeable future are not expected to, generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its debts and expenses. Further, Vornado Operating states that its only investee, AmeriCold Logistics ("Tenant"), anticipates that its Landlord, a partnership 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Crescent Real Estate Equities, will need to restructure the leases between the Landlord and the Tenant to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant (the Landlord has previously restructured the leases to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant). Management anticipates a further lease restructuring and the sale and or financing of assets by AmeriCold Logistics, and accordingly, Vornado Operating is expected to have a source to repay the debt under this facility, which may be extended. Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not recognized interest income on the debt under this facility. On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the Companys tenant at the cold storage warehouses (Temperature Controlled Logistics), for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value). The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest. AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility. On December 31, 2002, the joint venture purchased $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold at a 2% discount, of which the Companys share was $2,464,000. Other The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc. ("Capital Trust") totaling $29,212,000 at December 31, 2002. Mr. Roth, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is a member of the Board of Directors of Capital Trust nominated by the Company. On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue to the other venture partner, an entity controlled by the late Bernard Mendik, a former trustee and executive officer of the Company, for $60,000,000, resulting in a gain to the Company of $12,445,000. The sale was initiated by the Companys partner and was based on a competitive bidding process handled by an independent broker. The Company believes that the terms of the sale was at arms length and were fair to the Company. During 2002 and 2001, the Company paid approximately $147,000 and $136,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Companys trustees is a member. On January 1, 2001, the Company acquired the common stock of various preferred stock affiliates which was owned by Officers and Trustees of the Company and converted the affiliates to taxable REIT subsidiaries. The total acquisition price was $5,155,000. The purchase price, which was the estimated fair value, was determined by both independent appraisal and by reference to the individuals pro rata share of the earnings of the preferred stock affiliates during the three year period that these investments were held. 85 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Cash and cash equivalents were $208,200,000 at December 31, 2002, as compared to $265,584,000 at December 31, 2001, a $57,384,000 decrease.

Non recurring capital improvements completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years which were planned at the time of acquisition and tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space which was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property. Development and redevelopment expenditures include all hard and soft costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capitalized interest and operating costs until the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. ACQUISITIONS Acquisitions of individual properties are recorded as acquisitions of real estate assets. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price for property acquisitions and businesses acquired is allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities using their relative fair values as of the acquisition date based on valuations and other studies. Initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than 12 months from the acquisition date. CHARLES E. SMITH COMMERCIAL REALTY L.P. On January 1, 2002, the Company completed the combination of Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty L.P. ("CESCR") with Vornado. Prior to the combination, Vornado owned a 34% interest in CESCR. The consideration for the remaining 66% of CESCR was approximately $1,600,000,000, consisting of 15.6 million newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units and approximately $1 billion of debt (66% of CESCRs total debt). The purchase price paid by the Company was determined based on the weighted average closing price of the equity issued to CESCR unitholders for the period beginning two business days before and ending two business days after the date the acquisition was agreed to and announced on October 19, 2001. The Company also capitalized as part of the basis of the assets acquired approximately $32,000,000 for third party acquisition related costs, including advisory, legal and other professional fees that were contemplated at the time of the acquisition. The operations of CESCR are consolidated into the accounts of the Company beginning January 1, 2002. Prior to this date the Company accounted for its 34% interest on the equity method. See page 84 for unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2001. CRYSTAL GATEWAY ONE On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired a 360,000 square foot office building from a limited partnership, which is approximately 50% owned by Mr. Robert H. Smith and Mr. Robert P. Kogod and members of the Smith and Kogod families, trustees of the Company, in exchange for approximately 325,700 newly issued Vornado Operating Partnership units (valued at $13,679,000) and the assumption of $58,500,000 of debt. The building is located in the Crystal City complex in Arlington, Virginia where the Company already owns 24 office buildings containing over 6.9 million square feet, which it acquired on January 1, 2002, in connection with the Companys acquisition of CESCR. The operations of Crystal Gateway One are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition. BUILDING MAINTENANCE SERVICE COMPANY ("BMS") On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services primarily to the Companys Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including Mr. Greenbaum, one of the Companys executive officers. LAS CATALINAS MALL On September 23, 2002, the Company increased its interest in the Las Catalinas Mall located in Caguas, Puerto Rico (San Juan area) to 100% by acquiring the 50% of the mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store it did not already own. The purchase price was $48,000,000, including $32,000,000 of indebtedness. The Las Catalinas Mall, which opened in 1997, contains 492,000 square feet, including a 123,000 square foot Kmart and a 138,000 square foot Sears owned by the tenant. 87 MONMOUTH MALL On October 10, 2002, a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% interest, acquired the Monmouth Mall, an enclosed super regional shopping center located in Eatontown, New Jersey containing approximately 1.5 million square feet, including four department stores, three of which aggregating 731,000 square feet are owned by the tenants. The purchase price was approximately $164,700,000, including transaction costs of $4,400,000. The Company made a $7,000,000 common equity investment in the venture and provided it with $23,500,000 of preferred equity yielding 14%. The venture financed the purchase of the Mall with $135,000,000 of floating rate debt at LIBOR plus 2.05%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.50% on $35,000,000, a three year term and two one year extension options. The Companys investment in the Monmouth will be accounted for under the equity method as the Company does not have unilateral control over the joint venture. CARTHAGE, MISSOURI AND KANSAS CITY, KANSAS QUARRIES On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the Companys tenant at the cold storage warehouses (Temperature Controlled Logistics) for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value). The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest. The Companys future success will be affected by its ability to integrate the assets and businesses it acquires and to effectively manage those assets and businesses. The Company currently expects to continue to grow. However, its ability to do so will be dependent on a number of factors, including, among others, (a) the availability of reasonably priced assets that meet the Companys acquisition criteria and (b) the price of the Companys common shares, the rates at which the Company is able to borrow money and, more generally, the availability of financing on terms that, in the Companys view, make such acquisitions financially attractive. 88 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Cash flow provided by operating activities of $387,685,000 was primarily comprised of (i) income of $263,738,000, (ii) adjustments for non cash items of $131,832,000, and (iii) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $19,374,000.

There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of funds from operations. Funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers funds from operations a supplemental measure of operating performance and along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. Funds from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs since a number of REITs, including the Company, calculate funds from operations in a manner different from that used by NAREIT. Funds from operations, as defined by NAREIT, represents net income applicable to common shares before depreciation and amortization, extraordinary items and gains or losses on sales of real estate. Funds from operations as disclosed above has been modified from this definition to adjust primarily for the (i) effect of straight lining of property rentals for rent escalations and leasing fee income and (ii) the exclusion of income arising from the amortization of acquired below market leases, net of above market leases.

In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $230.9 million to be expended as outlined in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1 Business. The $230.9 million does not include amounts for other projects which are also included in the "Development and Redevelopment Projects" section of Item 1 Business, as no budgets for them have been finalized. There can be no assurance that any of the above projects will be ultimately completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount. No cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures and amortization of debt of Alexanders, The Newkirk MLP, or any other entity that is partially owned by the Company. These investees are expected to fund their own cash requirements. 93 FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Below is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2002: ($ in thousands) 2 3 4 5 Contractual Cash Obligations: Total 1 Year Years Years Thereafter Mortgages and Notes Payable....... $ 3,537,720(1) $ 449,526(1) $ 705,589 $ 550,321 $ 1,832,284 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007... 533,600 533,600 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility Operating Leases.................. 1,029,171 15,347 29,285 29,559 954,980 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,100,491 $ 464,873 $ 734,874 $ 1,113,480 $ 2,787,264 Commitments: Standby Letters of Credit......... $ 16,779 $ 16,779 $ $ $ Other Guarantees..................

The Company is reviewing various alternatives for the repayment or refinancing of debt coming due during 2003. The Company has $1 billion available under its revolving credit facility which matures in July 2003 and a number of properties which are unencumbered. The Companys credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization. The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Companys ratings below Baa3/BBB. This facility also contains customary events of default which could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage. The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance (fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets. The Companys all risk insurance policies in effect before September 11, 2001 do not expressly exclude coverage for hostile acts, except for acts of war. Since September 11, 2001, insurance companies have for the most part excluded terrorist acts from coverage in all risk policies. The Company has generally been unable to obtain all risk insurance which includes coverage for terrorist acts for policies it has renewed since September 11, 2001, for each of its businesses. In 2002, the Company obtained $200,000,000 of separate coverage for terrorist acts for each of its New York City Office, Washington, D.C. Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart businesses and $60,000,000 for its Temperature Controlled Logistics business. Therefore, the Company is at risk for financial loss in excess of these limits for terrorist acts (as defined), which loss could be material. The Companys debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt. The Company has received correspondence from four lenders regarding terrorism insurance coverage, which the Company has responded to. In these letters the lenders took the position that under the agreements governing the loans provided by these lenders the Company was required to maintain terrorism insurance on the properties securing the various loans. The aggregate amount of borrowings under these loans as of December 31, 2002 was approximately $770.4 million, and there was no additional borrowing capacity. Subsequently, the Company obtained an aggregate of $360 million of separate coverage for "terrorist acts". To date, one of the lenders has acknowledged to the Company that it will not raise any further questions based on the Companys terrorism insurance coverage in place, and the other three lenders have not raised any further questions regarding the Companys insurance coverage. If lenders insist on greater coverage for these risks, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to finance and or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio. 94 On November 26, 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was signed into law. Under this new legislation, through 2004 (with a possible extension through 2005), regulated insurers must offer coverage in their commercial property and casualty policies (including existing policies) for losses resulting from defined "acts of terrorism". The Company cannot currently anticipate whether the scope and cost of such coverage will be commercially reasonable. As a result of the legislation, in February 2003 the Company obtained $300 million of per occurrence coverage for terrorist acts for its New York City Office, Washington, D.C. Office and Merchandise Mart businesses, of which $240 million is for Certified Acts, as defined in the legislation. The Company maintains $200 million and $60 million of separate aggregate coverage that it had in 2002 for each of its Retail and Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses (which has been renewed as of January 1, 2003). The Companys current Retail property insurance carrier has advised the Company that there will be an additional premium of approximately $11,000 per month through the end of the policy term (June 30, 2003) for "Acts of Terrorism" coverage, as defined in the new legislation and that the situation may change upon renewal. In addition, many of the Companys non recourse mortgages contain debt service covenants which if not satisfied could require cash collateral. These covenants are not "ratings" related. In conjunction with the closing of Alexanders Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee, among other things, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexanders. CORPORATE On June 24, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2007. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually on June 15th and December 15th, commencing December 15, 2002. The net proceeds of approximately $496,300,000 were used to repay the mortgages on 350 North Orleans, Two Park Avenue, the Merchandise Mart and Seven Skyline. On June 27, 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on the $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2007 from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.5% if set on December 31, 2002). On February 25, 2002, the Company sold 884,543 common shares to a closed end fund and 514,200 shares to a unit investment trust based on the closing price of $42.96 on the NYSE. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $57,042,000. The Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $895,479,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $500,720,000 of debt securities. The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations will be adequate to fund business operations and the payment of dividends and distributions on an on going basis for more than the next twelve months; however, capital outlays for significant acquisitions will require funding from borrowings or equity offerings. 95 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SFAS NO. 141 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS SFAS No. 141 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS requires companies to account for the value of leases acquired and the costs of acquiring such leases separately from the value of the real estate for all acquisitions subsequent to July 1, 2001. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the leases in place for (i) the remaining 66% of CESCR it did not previously own which it acquired on January 1, 2002, (ii) the remaining 50% of the Las Catalinas Mall it did not previously own which it acquired on September 23, 2002 and (iii) a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall which it acquired on October 10, 2002; to determine whether they were acquired at market, above market or below market. The Companys evaluations were based on (i) the differences between contractual rentals and the estimated market rents over the applicable lease term discounted back to the date of acquisition utilizing a discount rate adjusted for the credit risk associated with the respective tenants and (ii) the estimated cost of acquiring such leases giving effect to the Companys history of providing tenant improvements and paying leasing commissions. As a result of its evaluations, as of December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded a deferred credit of $48,430,000 representing the value of acquired below market leases, deferred charges of $15,976,000 for the value of acquired above market leases and $3,621,000 for origination costs. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company has recognized property rentals of $12,634,000 for the amortization of below market leases net of above market leases, and depreciation expense of $1,214,000 for the amortization of the lease origination costs and additional building depreciation resulting from the reallocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties. SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing. SFAS No. 142 provides specific guidance for impairment testing of these assets and removes them from the scope of SFAS No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS. The Companys goodwill balance on December 31, 2001 of $30,129,000 consisted of $14,639,000 related to the Hotel Pennsylvania acquisition and $15,490,000 related to the acquisition of the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses. Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company performed impairment testing in accordance with SFAS 121. The Company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Given the decrease in the estimated market values and the deteriorating performance of Hotel Pennsylvania and Temperature Controlled Logistics, the Company performed a review for recoverability estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. As of December 31, 2001, the sum of the expected cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill, and therefore no impairments were recognized. Upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, the Company tested the goodwill for impairment at the reporting level unit utilizing the prescribed two step method. The first step compared the fair value of the reporting unit (determined based on a discounted cash flow approach) with its carrying amount. As the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the impairment loss. The second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. As the carrying amounts of the goodwill exceeded the fair values, on January 1, 2002 the Company wrote off all of the goodwill of the Hotel and the Temperature Controlled Logistics business as an impairment loss totaling $30,129,000. The write off has been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the income statement. Earnings allocable to the minority interest has been reduced by their pro rata share of the write off of goodwill. Previously reported "Income before gains on sale of real estate and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" and "Net income applicable to common shares" for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been approximately $972,000 higher, or $2.35 and $2.48 per diluted share, if such goodwill was not amortized in the prior year. 96 SFAS NO. 143 ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND SFAS NO. 144 ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG LIVED ASSETS In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (effective January 1, 2003) and SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG LIVED ASSETS (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 143 requires the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period which it is incurred. SFAS No. 144 supersedes current accounting literature and now provides for a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and requires discontinued operations presentation for disposals of a "component" of an entity. The adoption of these statements did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements; however under SFAS No. 144, if the Company were to dispose of a material operating property, such propertys results of operations will have to be separately disclosed as discontinued operations in the Companys financial statements. SFAS NO. 145 RESCISSION OF SFAS NO. 4, 44, AND 64, AMENDMENT OF SFAS NO. 13, AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, RESCISSION OF SFAS NO. 4, 44, AND 64, AMENDMENT OF SFAS NO. 13, AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS. SFAS No. 145 requires, among other things, (i) that the modification of a lease that results in a change of the classification of the lease from capital to operating under the provisions of SFAS No. 13 be accounted for as a sale leaseback transaction and (ii) the reporting of gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items only if they met the criteria of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The rescission of SFAS No. 4 is effective January 1, 2003. The amendment of SFAS No. 13 is effective for transactions occurring on or after May 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. SFAS NO. 146 ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (effective January 1, 2003). SFAS No. 146 replaces current accounting literature and requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. SFAS NO. 148 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 123 On August 7, 2002, the Company announced that beginning January 1, 2003, it will expense the cost of employee stock options in accordance with the SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 123 to amend the transition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123. Specifically, SFAS No. 123, as amended, would permit two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123 prospectively by valuing and accounting for employee stock options granted in 2003 and thereafter. The Company will utilize a binomial valuation model and appropriate market assumptions to determine the value of each grant. Stock based compensation expense will be recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the respective grants. FASB Interpretation No. 45 GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect to the Companys financial statements. 97 FASB Interpretation No. 46 CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, which requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise (i) if that enterprise, known as a "primary beneficiary", has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns if they occur, or both and (ii) if the entity is a variable interest entity, as defined by Interpretation No. 46. An entity is a variable interest entity if (a) the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or (b) the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity. Interpretation No. 46 applies immediately to all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created by public companies before February 1, 2003, Interpretation No. 46 must be applied no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which a primary beneficiary becomes involved with the entity and reconsidered as of the date one of three triggering events described by Interpretation No. 46 occur. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material effect on its financial statements. 98 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, beyond the control of the Company. Various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Companys cash flows and earnings. As of December 31, 2002 the Company has entered into an interest rate swap described in footnote 1 to the table below. Management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The Companys exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly owned and partially owned debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 Weighted Effect of 1% Weighted December 31, Average Change In December 31, Average Balance Interest Rate Base Rates Balance Interest Rate Wholly owned debt: Variable rate.................. $ 1,358,126(1) 2.69% $ 12,045(2) $ 1,182,605 3.39% Fixed rate..................... 2,713,194 7.17% 1,294,568 7.53% $ 4,071,320 5.61% 12,045 $ 2,477,173 Debt of partially owned entities: Variable rate.................. $ 131,100 4.54% 1,310(3) $ 85,516 5.63% Fixed rate..................... 917,008 8.41% 1,234,019 8.29% $ 1,048,108 7.92% 1,310 $ 1,319,535 Minority interest..................... (2,805) Total decrease in the Companys annual net income......... $ 10,550 Per share diluted................ $ .10 (1) Includes $533,600 for the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007, as the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.18% if set on December 31, 2002). In accordance with SFAS 133, as amended, accounting for these swaps requires the Company to fair value the debt at each reporting period. At December 31, 2002, the fair value adjustment was $34,245, and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above. (2) The effect of a 1% change in wholly owned debt base rates shown above excludes $153,659 of variable rate mortgage financing, cross collateralized by the Companys 770 Broadway and 595 Madison Avenue office properties, as the proceeds are held in a restricted mortgage escrow account which bears interest at the same rate as the loans. (3) The effect of a 1% change in partially owned debt base rates shown above is calculated after including $45,229 representing the Companys 14.9% share of Prime Group Realty L.P.s ("PGE") outstanding variable rate debt as at September 30, 2002. PGE has not filed its annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2002, prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10 K. The fair value of the Companys debt, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt, exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately $178,566,000 at December 31, 2002. 99
