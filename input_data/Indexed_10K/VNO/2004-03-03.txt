In addition, the Company has a 60% interest in a partnership that owns cold storage warehouses nationwide. The Companys business objective is to maximize shareholder value. The Companys measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders. Below is a table comparing the Companys performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the following periods ending December 31, 2003: Total Return Vornado RMS One year 57.7 % 36.7 % Three years 74.8 % 59.9 % Five years 119.6 % 93.6 % Ten years 481.1 % 181.7 %(1) (1) From inception on July 25, 1995 The Company intends to continue to achieve its business objective by pursuing its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit. Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation. Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents. Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area. Developing/redeveloping the Companys existing properties to increase returns and maximize value. The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. The Companys success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. The current economic recovery is fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending. To the extent this recovery stalls, the Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. Alternatively, if the recovery continues, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Companys weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow. 66 Overview Leasing Activity The following table summarizes, by business segment, the leasing statistics which the Company views as key performance indicators.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Companys accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys carrying amount of its real estate, net of accumulated depreciation is $6.9 billion. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements and beginning in 2002, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and the value of acquired in place leases in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 and 142) and acquired liabilities, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The Companys properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Identified Intangible Assets and Goodwill Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired (including identified intangible assets) and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, unless the fair value of specific components of the reporting group are determinable without undue cost and effort. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying amounts of the Companys identified intangible assets are $106,281,000 and $50,487,000 and the carrying amount of goodwill is $4,345,000 (arising from the 2003 acquisition of Building Maintenance Services) and $0, respectively. Such amounts are included in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company has $47,266,000 and $48,430,000, of deferred credits as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, which are included as liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. If the Company incorrectly estimates the fair value of these assets at acquisition or in connection with impairment testing, or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of finite life intangible assets, the impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements could be material. 69 Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable The Companys policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premiums. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying amount of Notes and Mortgage Loans receivable was $285,965,000. The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest on impaired loans is recognized on a cash basis. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2003, the carrying amount of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders, was $900,600,000. The Company considers APB 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, SOP 78 9 Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures, EITF 96 16 Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has the Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Partners have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, to determine the method of accounting for each of its partially owned entities. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members. The Company has concluded that it does not control a partially owned entity, despite an ownership interest of 50% or greater, if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to major decisions, such as operating and capital budgets, the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, the hiring of a chief executive officer, the commencement, compromise or settlement of any lawsuit, legal proceeding or arbitration or the placement of new or additional financing secured by assets of the venture. This is the case with respect to the Companys 60% interest in Temperature Controlled Logistics, 80% interest in Starwood Ceruzzi Venture, and 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, MartParc Wells, MartParc Orleans, and 825 Seventh Avenue. If the Company is able to unilaterally make decisions for a partially owned entity, the Company has concluded that it controls the entity and therefore consolidates the entity. The Company accounts for investments on the equity method when its ownership interest is greater than 20% and less than 50%, and the Company does not have direct or indirect control. When partially owned entities are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Companys share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to and from these entities. All other investments are accounted for on the cost method. On a periodic basis the Company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys investments in partially owned entities are impaired. The ultimate realization of the Companys investment in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions. If the Company determines that a decline in the value of the investee is other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts ($15,246,000 as at December 31, 2003) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement. The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($2,830,000 as at December 31, 2003). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. If estimates differ from actual results, this would impact reported results. 70 Revenue Recognition The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rents income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. Percentage Rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with SAB 104, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenues income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Show Revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses among other things, its collectibility. If the Company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue, its net income and assets could be misstated. IncomeTaxes The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, it would fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result. 71 Net income and EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Below is a summary of Net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. On January 1, 2003, the Company revised its definition of EBITDA to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation G concerning non GAAP financial measures. The revised definition of EBITDA includes minority interest, gains (losses) on the sale of depreciable real estate and income arising from the straight lining of rent and the amortization of acquired in place leases. Accordingly, EBITDA for all periods disclosed represents Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it is related to the return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA is not a surrogate for net income because net income is after interest expense and accordingly, is a measure of return on equity as opposed to return on assets.

(2) Reflects an increase of $2,841 resulting from the rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002, in which they were previously held to the first quarter of 2003, and $1,400 relates to a new show held for the first time in 2003, partially offset by lower trade show revenue in 2003 primarily due to a smaller April Market show as a result of a conversion of trade show space to permanent space. (3) Reflects increases of $12,953 from New York City Office leasing activity and $2,901 from CESCRs leasing activity. These increases resulted primarily from higher rents for space relet in 2003 and 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to a partial year in 2002) and an increase in CESCR occupancy of .3% this year, partially offset by a decrease in NYC office occupancy of .6%. Initial rent for the 677 square feet of space relet in New York City was $44.41 per square foot in 2003, a 15.3% increase over prior escalated rent. Initial rent for the 2,510 square feet of space relet in CESCR portfolio was $30.62 per square foot a 2.5% increase over prior escalated rents. For further details of NYC and CESCR office leasing activity see page 67. (4) Resulted primarily from (i) an increase in the occupancy rate from 88.3% at December 31, 2002 to 93.0% at December 31, 2003 as a result of leasing space previously vacated by Bradlees and Kmart and (ii) higher rents for space relet in 2003 and 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to a partial year in 2002). Initial rent for the 1,046 square feet of space relet in 2003 was $15.56 per square foot, a 13.2% increase over prior rent. For further details of Retail leasing activity see page 67. (5) Reflects an increase in occupancy of Merchandise Mart office space of 0.9% from 2002, higher rents for 1,157 square feet of showroom space relet in 2003 and 911 square feet relet in 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to partial year impact in 2002), partially offset by a decrease in Merchandise Mart showroom occupancy of .1% from 2002 and lower rents for 270 square feet of office space relet in 2003. Initial rents for the 1,157 square feet of showroom space relet in 2003 was $23.43, a 0.6% increase over prior escalated rent. Initial rents for the 270 square feet of office space relet in 2003 was $21.24, a 5.3% decrease over prior escalated rent. For further details of Merchandise Mart leasing activity see page 67. (6) Reflects higher reimbursements from tenants resulting primarily from increases in real estate taxes. The increases in Office and Retail were $19,383 and $3,247, before reductions of $2,215 and $1,407 in the current quarter relating to the true up of prior years billings. (7) Results primarily from a $3,444 decrease in CESCR third party leasing revenue from $7,100 in 2002 to $3,656 in 2003 as a result of the closing of one of the CESCR leasing offices. 77 Expenses The Companys expenses were $921,097,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $852,370,000 in the prior year, an increase of $68,727,000.

(2) Results primarily from the rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002, in which they were previously held to the first quarter of 2003, and due to a new trade show held for the first time in 2003. (3) Below are the details of the increases (decreases) in operating expenses by segment: Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other Real estate taxes $ 26,935 $ 20,904 (a) $ 1,245 $ 4,724 $ 62 Utilities (946 ) (906 ) 364 (483 ) 79 Maintenance 5,286 2,997 2,302 (33 ) 20 Ground rent 950 1,005 (55 ) Bad debt expense (29 ) (1,541 ) 1,238 274 Other 794 1,394 (139 ) (958 ) 497 $ 32,990 $ 23,853 $ 4,955 $ 3,524 $ 658 (a) Relates primarily to an increase in New York Office. (4) Increases in depreciation and amortization for the Office and Merchandise Mart segments are primarily due to additions to buildings and improvements. (5) The increase in general and administrative expenses results from: Increase in professional fees in connection with information technology, corporate governance, insurance, and other projects. $ 4,675 Severance payments in 2003 to two senior executives ($3,211) and the non cash charge related to the accelerated vesting of their restricted stock ($1,626). 4,837 Other severance. 860 Increase in corporate payroll and fringe benefits of which $755 is due to a decrease in capitalized development payroll and $407 is due to the Companys deferred compensation plan (offset by an equal amount of investment income). 2,872 Costs in connection with the relocation of CESCRs back office operations to the Companys administrative headquarters in New Jersey. 1,123 Stock compensation expense (see below). 1,898 Other 1,175 $ 17,440 As part of the 2002 annual compensation review, in lieu of stock options, on January 28, 2003 the Company granted 166,990 restricted shares at $34.50 per share (the then closing stock price on the NYSE) to employees of the Company. These awards vest over a 5 year period. Stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $1,898,000 (excluding severance charges), of which $1,020,000 related to January 2003 restricted stock awards. 79 Income Applicable to Alexanders Income applicable to Alexanders (interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $15,574,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $29,653,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $14,079,000. This decrease resulted primarily from (i) Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation expense of which the Companys share was $14,868,000 in 2003 compared to zero in 2002, partially offset by (ii) Alexanders gain on the sale of its Third Avenue property of which the Companys share was $3,524,000 in 2002, and (iii) income resulting from the commencement of the lease with Bloomberg (87% of the space) on November 15, 2003 at Alexanders 731 Lexington Avenue property of which the Companys share was $1,589,000.

(2) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships (the Landlord) rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent is $49,436. The following summarizes the increase in income for the year ended December 31, 2003 over the prior year: Increase in rent from Tenant $ 1,220 Decrease in general and administrative expenses 544 Gain on sale of real estate in 2003 ($486) as compared to a loss on sale of real estate in 2002 ($2,026) 2,512 Income tax refund received in 2003 1,345 Decrease in depreciation and interest expense and other 3,088 $ 8,709 On February 23, 2004, AmeriCold Logistics announced that Alec Covington resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer effective March 31, 2004, to take an opportunity in an unrelated industry. A search to identify a successor is currently underway. (3) The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall on October 10, 2002. Equity in net income of the Monmouth Mall includes the Companys preferred return of $3,290 and $748 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. (4) On September 23, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of the Mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store it did not previously own. Accordingly, the operations of Las Catalinas are consolidated into the accounts of the Company subsequent to September 23, 2002. 81 Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $25,402,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $31,685,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $6,283,000. This decrease resulted primarily from (i) lower average investments at lower yields, partially offset by (ii) $5,655,000 of contingent interest income recognized in connection with the repayment of the Dearborn Center loan and (iii) $5,028,000 of interest income recognized on the $225,000,000 GM Building mezzanine loans, for the period from October 20, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $229,662,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $234,113,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $4,451,000. This decrease was primarily comprised of a $11,285,000 savings from a 77 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rates of the Companys variable rate debt, partially offset by (i) the consolidation as of September 2002 of the Las Catalinas operations which were previously included in income from partially owned entities, (ii) a full year of interest expense on the Companys $500,000,000 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 which were issued in June 2002 and (iii) a reduction in interest capitalized in connection with development projects. Net (Loss) Gain on Disposition of Wholly owned and Partially owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate The following table sets forth the details of net (loss) gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: For the Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2003 2002 Wholly owned Assets: Net gain on sale of marketable securities $ 2,950 $ 12,346 Loss on settlement of Primestone guarantees (2003) and foreclosure and impairment losses (2002) (1,388 ) (35,757 ) Gain on sale of land parcels 499 Gain on sale of residential condominiums units 282 2,156 Gain on transfer of mortgages 2,096 Net gain on sale of air rights 1,688 $ 2,343 $ (17,471 ) Primestone Foreclosure and Impairment Losses On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. (Primestone). The Company received a 1% up front fee and was entitled to receive certain other fees aggregating approximately 3% upon repayment of the loan. The loan bore interest at 16% per annum. Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Companys collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount. The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE. The loans were also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone. On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Companys net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. The participation did not meet the criteria for sale accounting under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets. Accordingly, the Company was required to account for this transaction as a borrowing secured by the loan, rather than as a sale of the loan by classifying the participation as an Other Liability and continuing to report the outstanding loan balance at 100% in Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable on the balance sheet. 82 On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction. The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestones indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange. On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim. In the second quarter of 2002, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2002 and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees. The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the stock had been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2002, the Companys carrying amount of the investment was $23,908,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, partially offset by $1,005,000 representing the Companys share of Prime Groups net loss through September 30, 2002, as the Company recorded its share of Prime Groups earnings on a one quarter lag basis. On June 11, 2003, the Company exercised its right to exchange the 3,972,447 units it owned in Prime Group Realty L.P. for 3,972,447 common shares in Prime Group Realty Trust. Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in the partnership on the equity method. Subsequent to the exchange, the Company is accounting for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security available for sale, as the Companys shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company does not have significant influence and the common shares have a readily determinable fair value. Accordingly, the carrying amount previously included in Investments and Advances to Partially Owned Entities was reclassified to Marketable Securities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is also required to mark these securities to market based on the closing price of the PGE shares on the NYSE at the end of each reporting period. For the period from June 11, 2003 through December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $6,623,000 unrealized gain, which is not included in the Companys net income, but is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the Shareholders Equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. From the date of exchange, income recognition is limited to dividends received on the PGE shares. On June 13, 2003, the Company received its $5,000,000 share of a settlement with affiliates of Primestone Investment Partners of the amounts due under the guarantees of the Primestone loans. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a $1,388,000 loss on settlement of the guarantees, which has been reflected as a component of net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets in the Companys 2003 consolidated statement of income. Gain on Transfer of Mortgages In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain of $2,096,000 resulting from payments to the Company by third parties that assumed certain of the Companys mortgages. Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Companys obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages. The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans. 83 Minority Interest Minority interest was $178,675,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $140,933,000 for the prior year, an increase of $37,742,000. The increase is primarily due to higher income in 2003, primarily as a result of of net gains on sale of real estate of $161,789,000, and an increase in preferred unit distributions of $2,187,000, representing the original issuance costs on the redemption of the Series D 1 preferred units. Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation. The following table set forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. December 31, 2003 2002 Palisades $ 138,629 $ 142,333 Baltimore (Dundalk) 2,167 2,050 Vineland 908 978 Two Park Avenue (sold on October 10, 2003) 123,076 Hagerstown (sold on November 3, 2003) 1,013 Baltimore (sold on January 9, 2003) 2,218 $ 141,704 $ 271,668 Liabilities related to discontinued operations represent the Palisades mortgage payable of $120,000,000 and $100,000,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively. The combined results of operations of the assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: December 31, 2003 2002 Total Revenues $ 42,694 $ 42,831 Total Expenses 28,621 32,947 Income from discontinued operations $ 14,073 $ 9,884 On February 2, 2004, the Palisades Venture in which the Company owns a 75% interest entered into an agreement to sell its only asset, a 538 unit high rise residential apartment tower in Fort Lee, New Jersey, for $222,500,000. On February 27, 2004, in order to permit a potential like kind exchange, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest it did not previously own for its partners share of the net sales price (approximately $17,000,000). The Companys gain on sale after closing costs will be approximately $70,000,000. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2004. Gains on Sales of Real Estate ( Discontinued Operations in 2003) On January 9, 2003, the Company sold its Baltimore, Maryland shopping center for $4,752,000, which resulted in a net gain after closing costs of $2,644,000. On October 10, 2003, the Company sold Two Park Avenue, a 965,000 square foot office building, for $292,000,000 to SEB Immobelien Investment GNBH, a German capital investment company, which resulted in a net gain on the sale after closing costs of $156,433,000. On November 3, 2003, the Company sold its Hagerstown, Maryland shopping center for $3,100,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $1,945,000. 84 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In September 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company wrote off goodwill of approximately $30,129,000 of which (i) $15,490,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Companys investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,639,000 represents goodwill arising from the Companys acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania. The write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the 2002 consolidated statement income. EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA. (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Other Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 826,659 $ 610,531 $ 113,900 $ 108,078 $ 69,798 $ (75,648 ) 2003 Operations: Same store operations(1) 5,670 5,086 4,445 3,517 (3) Acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses 164,488 24,493 5,364 4,650 Year ended December 31, 2003 $ 1,037,896 $ 780,689 $ 143,479 $ 117,887 $ 77,965 $ (82,124 ) % increase in same store operations 1.0 %(2) 4.5 % 4.1 % 4.8 %(3) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses above. (2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $488,419 ($331,886 excluding gains on sale of real estate of $156,533) and 3.3% (excluding such gains) for the New York office portfolio and $292,270 and (1.7%) for the CESCR portfolio. 36% of the same store decrease at CESCR reflects a reduction in third party net leasing fees. (3) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships (the Landlord) rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent is $49,436. The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 1.3%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is higher than last year by $607 (a 0.4% increase). In addition, in 2003, the tenant and the Landlord had lower general and administrative expenses and the Landlord received $885 of EBITDA from its investment in the quarries it acquired in December 2002 which was reflected in the gross profit of the tenant in the prior year. 85 Years Ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 Revenues The Companys revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements, hotel revenues, trade shows revenues, amortization of above and below market leases acquired under SFAS No. 141 and 142, and other income, were $1,392,239,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $952,161,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $440,078,000 of which $423,128,000 resulted from the acquisition of the remaining 66% of CESCR and the resulting consolidation of its operations.

Accordingly, CESCR is consolidated as of January 1, 2002. (2) On September 20, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of the Mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store that it did not previously own. Accordingly, Las Catalinas is consolidated for the period from September 20, 2002 to December 31, 2002. (3) On October 10, 2002, a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50% interest, acquired the Monmouth Mall. (4) Vornados interest in the equity in net income of the Monmouth Mall includes a preferred return of $748 for the year ended December 31, 2002. (5) The year ended December 31, 2001 includes $1,394 for the Companys share of a gain on sale of a property. (6) The year ended December 31, 2002 excludes 570 Lexington Avenue which was sold in May 2001. (7) The year ended December 31, 2001 includes $2,000 for the Companys share of equity in loss of its Russian Tea Room (RTR) investment. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote off its entire net investment in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate. 88 Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $31,685,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $54,385,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, a decrease of $22,700,000. This decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of (i) $12,347,000 due to the non recognition of income on the mortgage loan to Primestone, which was foreclosed on April 30, 2002, (ii) $4,626,000 due to a lower yield on the investment of the proceeds received from the May 2002 repayment of the Companys loan to NorthStar Partnership L.P. (22% yield in 2001) and (iii) $2,269,000 due to the non recognition of income on the loan to Vornado Operating. Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $234,113,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $167,430,000 in the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $66,683,000. This increase was comprised of (i) $100,013,000 from the acquisition of the remaining 66% of CESCR and the resulting consolidation of its operations, partially offset by (ii) a $32,035,000 savings from a 202 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rates of the Companys variable rate debt and (iii) lower average outstanding debt balances. Net Loss on Disposition of Wholly owned and Partially owned Assets Other Than Depreciable Real Estate The following table sets forth the details of net loss on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001: (Amounts in thousands) For the Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Wholly owned Assets: Gain on transfer of mortgages $ 2,096 $ Gain on sale of Kinzie Park condominiums units 2,156 Net gain on sale of air rights 1,688 Net gain on sale of marketable securities 12,346 Primestone foreclosure and impairment losses (35,757 ) Write off of investments in technology companies (16,513 ) Partially owned Assets: After tax net gain on sale of Park Laurel condominium units 15,657 Write off of net investment in Russian Tea Room (RTR) (7,374 ) Other 160 $ (17,471 ) $ (8,070 ) Write off Investments in Technology Companies In 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $16,513,000 resulting from the write off of all of its remaining equity investments in technology companies due to both the deterioration of the financial condition of these companies and the lack of acceptance by the market of certain of their products and services. The above charge is net of $1,481,000 of income resulting from the reversal of a deferred rent liability relating to the termination of an agreement permitting one of the technology companies access to its properties. After tax Net Gain on Sale of Park Laurel Condominium Units In 2001, the Park Laurel Joint Venture (69% interest owned by the Company) completed the sale of 52 condominium units of the total 53 units and received proceeds of $139,548,000. The Companys share of the after tax net gain was $15,657,000 and is after a charge of $3,953,000 (net of tax benefit of $1,826,000) for awards accrued under the ventures incentive compensation plan. Write off of Net Investment in RTR In the third quarter of 2001, the Company wrote off its entire net investment of $7,374,000 in RTR based on the operating losses and an assessment of the value of the real estate. 89 Minority Interest Minority interest was $140,933,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $112,363,000 for the prior year, an increase of $28,570,000. This increase is primarily due to operating partnership units issued in connection with acquisitions. Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation. The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, 2002 2001 Palisades $ 142,333 $ 66,173 Two Park Avenue (sold on October 10, 2003) 123,076 124,261 Baltimore (sold on January 9, 2003) 2,218 2,253 Baltimore (Dundalk) 2,050 2,221 Hagerstown (sold on November 3, 2003) 1,013 1,026 Vineland 978 1,071 $ 271,668 $ 197,005 Liabilities related to discontinued operations represent the Palisades mortgage payable of $100,000,000 and $0 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The combined results of operations of the assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Total revenues $ 42,831 $ 33,612 Total expenses 32,947 23,270 Income from discontinued operations $ 9,884 $ 10,342 Gains on Sale of Real Estate On August 6, 2001, the Company sold its leasehold interest in 550/600 Mamaroneck Avenue for $22,500,000, which approximated book value. In September 1998, Atlantic City condemned the Companys property. In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a gain of $1,694,000, which reflected the condemnation award of $3,100,000, net of the carrying value of the property of $1,406,000. The Company appealed the amount and on June 27, 2001, was awarded an additional $3,050,000, which has been recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. On May 17, 2001, the Company sold its 50% interest in 570 Lexington Avenue for $60,000,000, resulting in a net gain after closing costs of $12,445,000. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002, the Company wrote off all of the goodwill associated with the Hotel Pennsylvania and the Temperature Controlled Logistics businesses aggregating $30,129,000. This write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 2002. In 2001, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $4,110,000 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 133. 90 EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA. (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Other Year ended December 31, 2001 $ 723,491 $ 409,843 $ 123,809 $ 115,959 $ 77,721 $ (3,841 ) 2002 Operations: Same store operations(1) 18,165 (3,131 )(3) (1,354 )(5) (6,613 )(6) Acquisitions, dispositions and non recurring income and expenses 182,523 (6,778 )(4) (6,527 ) (1,310 ) Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 826,659 $ 610,531 (2) $ 113,900 $ 108,078 $ 69,798 $ (75,648 )(7) % increase (decrease) in same store operations 4.8 %(2) (2.6% )(3) (1.2% )(5) (8.4% )(6) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses. (2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase was $320,874 and 5.0% for the New York City office portfolio and $289,657 and 4.1% for the CESCR portfolio. (3) Primarily due to lower occupancy and increases in allowances for bad debt expense as a result of the K Mart and other bankruptcies and the expiration of the Stop & Shop guarantees of several former Bradlees locations. Average occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 88.3% (84.0% excluding leases which have not commenced as described in the following sentences) as compared to 92% at December 31, 2001. The 88.3% occupancy rate includes leases for 490,000 square feet at five locations which have not commenced as of December 31, 2002. (4) Primarily due to the Companys share of losses from the Starwood Ceruzzi venture in 2002 of $1,416 (before depreciation) from properties placed in service, as compared to a gain of $1,394 from the sale of one of the ventures assets in 2001. EBITDA aggregating $2,600 from the acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 of a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall and the remaining 50% interest in the Las Catalinas Mall the Company did not previously own, was offset by lease termination fees and other refunds in the fourth quarter of 2001. (5) The net of a $1,685 or 1.5% same store increase in the core portfolio and a $3,300 or a 66% decline at the LA Mart as a result of rent reductions and increased marketing expenditures. (6) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships (the Landlord) rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize its $19,349 share of the rent the joint venture was due for the year ended December 31, 2002. The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by .1%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period decreased by $614 (a .001% decrease). The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a reduction in customer inventory turns, a rate reduction with a significant customer and temporary plant shut downs. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher insurance and workers compensation. In addition, the tenants cash requirements for capital expenditures, debt service and a non recurring pension funding were $8,293 higher in the current year than in the prior year, which impacted the ability of the tenant to pay rent. (7) Reflects net non recurring items included in EBITDA (see page 75 footnote 3 for details) 91 Supplemental Information Three Months Ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 In comparing the financial results of the Companys segments on a quarterly basis, the following should be noted: The third quarter of the Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically been impacted by higher net utility costs than in each other quarter of the year; The fourth quarter of the Retail segment have historically been higher than each of the first three quarters due to the recognition of percentage rental income in that quarter; and The second and fourth quarter of the Merchandise Mart segment have historically been higher than the first and third quarters due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. Below is a summary of Net Income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.

The loan bears interest at 4.49% per annum (based on the applicable Federal rate) and matures in January 2006. The Company also provided Mr. Roth with the right to draw up to $15,000,000 of additional loans on a revolving basis. Each additional loan will bear interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and will mature on the sixth anniversary of the loan. On May 29, 2002, Mr. Roth replaced common shares of the Company securing the Companys outstanding loan to Mr. Roth with options to purchase common shares of the Company with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. In 2002, as a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Roth supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities. At December 31, 2003, loans due from Mr. Fascitelli, in accordance with his employment agreement, aggregated $8,600,000. The loans mature in December 2006 and bear interest, payable quarterly at a weighted average interest rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate). Pursuant to Mr. Fascitellis 1996 employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli became entitled to a deferred payment consisting of $5 million in cash and a convertible obligation payable November 30, 2001, at the Companys option, in either 919,540 common shares or the cash equivalent of their appreciated value, so long as such appreciated value is not less than $20 million. The Company delivered 919,540 shares to a rabbi trust upon execution of the 1996 employment agreement. The Company accounted for the stock compensation as a variable arrangement in accordance with Plan B of EITF No. 97 14 Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested as the agreement permitted settlement in either cash or common shares. Following the guidance in EITF 97 14, the Company recorded changes in the fair value of its compensation obligation with a corresponding increase in the liability Officers Deferred Compensation. Effective as of June 7, 2001, the payment date was deferred until November 30, 2004. Effective as of December 14, 2001, the payment to Mr. Fascitelli was converted into an obligation to deliver a fixed number of shares (919,540 shares), establishing a measurement date for the Companys stock compensation obligation, accordingly the Company ceased accounting for the Rabbi Trust under Plan B of the EITF and began Plan A accounting. Under Plan A, the accumulated liability representing the value of the shares on December 14, 2001, was reclassified as a component of Shareholders Equity as Deferred compensation shares earned but not yet delivered. In addition, effective December 14, 2001 future changes in the value of the shares are no longer recognized as additional compensation expense. The fair value of this obligation was $50,345,000 at December 31, 2003. The Company has reflected this liability as Deferred Compensation Shares Not Yet Delivered in the Shareholders Equity section of the balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized approximately $4,744,000 of compensation expense of which $2,612,000 represented the appreciation in value of the shares and $2,132,000 represented dividends paid on the shares. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed). The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002. The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares. The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense. Pursuant to the Companys annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due January 1, 2006. The loan, which was funded on July 23, 2002, was made in conjunction with Mr. Macnows June 2002 exercise of options to purchase 225,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The loan is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. In 2002, as a result of the decline in the value of the options, Mr. Macnow supplemented the collateral with cash and marketable securities. One other executive officer of the Company has a loan outstanding pursuant to an employment agreement totaling $500,000 at December 31, 2003. The loan matures in April 2005 and bears interest at the applicable Federal rate provided (4.5% at December 31, 2003). 96 Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company Alexanders The Company owns 33.1% of Alexanders. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexanders, the Company provides various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexanders aggregating $124,000,000 at December 31, 2003. These agreements and the loans are described in Note 5. Investments in Partially Owned Entities to the Companys consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10 K. In 2002, the Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low income residential housing development (the 30th Street Venture), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as air rights. The Company donated the building to a charitable organization. The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot. An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexanders at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexanders 59th Street development project (the 59th Street Project). In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights. The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights related to the 30th Street Venture. These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low income housing and community facility project. The 30th Street Venture asked Alexanders to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights. In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexanders for an aggregate sales price of $3,058,000 (an average of $109 per square foot). Alexanders then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot). Interstate Properties The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent and certain other commissions. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. Although the management agreement was not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company earned $703,000, $747,000 and $1,133,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, during fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexanders, Alexanders paid to Interstate $587,000, $703,000 and $522,000, respectively, for the leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company. Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein. This arrangement was terminated in 2003 and all payments by Alexanders for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company. Building Maintenance Service Company (BMS) On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Companys Manhattan office properties for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David Greenbaum, one of the Companys executive officers. The Company paid BMS $53,024,000 and $51,280,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 for services rendered at the Companys Manhattan office properties. Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company. 97 Vornado Operating Company and AmeriCold Logistics In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which expires on December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company receives a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility. No amortization is required to be paid under the revolving credit facility during its term. The revolving credit facility prohibits Vornado Operating from incurring indebtedness to third parties (other than certain purchase money debt and certain other exceptions) and prohibits Vornado Operating from paying dividends. As of December 31, 2003, $21,989,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Vornado Operating has disclosed that there is substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern and its ability to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Vornado Operating has incurred losses since its inception and in the aggregate its investments do not, and for the foreseeable future are not expected to, generate sufficient cash flow to pay all of its debts and expenses. Vornado Operating estimates that it has adequate borrowing capacity under its credit facility with the Company to meet its cash needs until December 31, 2004. However, the principal, interest and fees outstanding under the line of credit come due on such date. Further, Vornado Operating states that its only investee, AmeriCold Logistics (Tenant), anticipates that its Landlord, a partnership 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Crescent Real Estate Equities, will need to restructure the leases between the Landlord and the Tenant to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant (the Landlord has previously restructured the leases to provide additional cash flow to the Tenant). Management anticipates a further lease restructuring in 2004, although it is under no obligation to do so and there can be no assurance that it will do so. Vornado Operating is expected to have a source to repay the debt under this facility from the lease restructuring or other options, although not by its original due date. Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not recognized interest income on the debt under this facility. Other On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics, the Companys tenant at the cold storage warehouses (Temperature Controlled Logistics), for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value). The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest. AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility. The Company owns preferred securities in Capital Trust, Inc. (Capital Trust) with a carrying amount of $29,259,000 at December 31, 2003. Mr. Roth, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado Realty Trust, is a member of the Board of Directors of Capital Trust nominated by the Company. During 2002, the Company paid approximately $147,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Companys trustees is a member. On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, together with family members owned approximately 24 percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith was a general partner. On August 5, 2003, the Company repaid the mortgage of $29,056,000. On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5% interest in the planned redevelopment of Waterfront, located at 401 M Street, a mixed use project in Washington D.C. for $2,171,000, of which the Company paid $1,545,000 in cash and issued 12,500 Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units valued at $626,000. The partnership units were issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the partners in the Waterfront interest, and the President of the Companys CESCR division. In connection with the Park Laurel condominium project, in 2001 the joint venture accrued and paid $5,779,000 of awards under the ventures incentive compensation plan. 98 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with existing cash balances will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from borrowings or equity offerings. Certain Future Cash Requirements For 2004 the Company has budgeted approximately $194.2 million for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows: (Amounts in thousands except per square foot data) Total New York Office CESCR Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other (1) Expenditures to maintain the assets $ 66,900 $ 16,200 $ 28,100 $ 5,800 $ 15,300 $ 1,500 Tenant improvements 98,500 19,500 52,100 15,000 11,900 Per square foot 30.00 15.50 8.00 12.50 Leasing Commissions 28,800 7,800 13,100 6,000 1,900 Per square foot 12.00 3.85 3.20 2.00 Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions $ 194,200 $ 43,500 $ 93,300 $ 26,800 $ 29,100 $ 1,500 Square feet budgeted to be leased 650 3,365 1,875 950 (1) Primarily Hotel Pennsylvania. During the year ended December 31, 2003, actual capital expenditures and leasing commissions were $131,972,000, as compared to a budget of $168,000,000. In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $383.5 million. Of this amount $169.0 million is estimated to be expended in 2004. The $383.5 million does not include amounts for pre development projects, as no budgets for them have been finalized. There can be no assurance that any of the above projects will be ultimately completed, completed on time or completed for the budgeted amount. The Company is also committed to fund up to $32,420,000 in connection with its initial investment in two partially owned entities. No cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures of Alexanders, Newkirk MLP, or any other entity that is partially owned by the Company. These investees are expected to fund their own cash requirements. 99 Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations Below is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2003. (Amounts in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations: Mortgages and Notes Payable $ 3,461,038 $ 296,184 $ 1,030,280 $ 661,339 $ 1,473,235 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 500,000 500,000 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 200,000 200,000 Operating Leases 985,438 14,666 27,906 28,075 914,791 Purchase Obligations, primarily construction commitments 48,900 44,000 4,900 Capital lease obligations 7 7 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 5,195,383 $ 354,850 $ 1,063,086 $ 1,189,421 $ 2,588,026 Commitments: Capital commitments to partially owned entities $ 32,420 $ 32,420 $ $ $ Standby Letters of Credit 15,034 14,979 55 Other Guarantees Total Commitments $ 47,454 $ 47,399 $ 55 $ $ As of March 1, 2004, the Company repaid $227,586,000 of the debt coming due during 2004. The Company has $600,000,000 available under its revolving credit facility which matures in July 2006 and a number of properties which are unencumbered. The Companys credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization. The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Companys ratings below Baa3/BBB. This facility also contains customary events of default that could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage. The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 which expires in 2004 with a possible extension through 2005 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets. Below is a summary of the all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance for each of the Companys business segments: Coverage Per Occurrence All Risk(1) Sub limits for Acts of Terrorism New York Office $ 1,000,000,000 $ 300,000,000 CESCR Office $ 1,000,000,000 $ 300,000,000 Retail $ 500,000,000 $ 500,000,000 Merchandise Mart $ 1,000,000,000 $ 300,000,000 Temperature Controlled Logistics $ 225,000,000 $ 225,000,000 (1) Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub limit shown in the adjacent column. In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. The Companys debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007 and 2010 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to finance and or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio. In conjunction with the closing of Alexanders Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee to the construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexanders. The Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $822,990,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $1,800,262,000 of debt securities. 100 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Cash and cash equivalents were $320,542,000 at December 31, 2003, as compared to $208,200,000 at December 31, 2002, an increase of $112,342,000. Cash flow provided by operating activities of $528,951,000 was primarily comprised of (i) income of $460,703,000, (ii) adjustments for non cash items of $99,985,000, partially offset by (iii) the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $31,737,000.

Non recurring capital improvements completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years which were planned at the time of acquisition and tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space which was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property. Development and redevelopment expenditures include all hard and soft costs associated with the development or redevelopment of a property, including tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capitalized interest and operating costs until the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. 2003 Acquisitions Acquisitions of individual properties are recorded as acquisitions of real estate assets. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price for property acquisitions and businesses acquired is allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities using their relative fair values as of the acquisition date based on valuations and other studies. Initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized no later than 12 months from the acquisition date. Building Maintenance Service Company (BMS) On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired for $13,000,000 in cash BMS, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services principally to the Companys Manhattan office properties.

Kaempfers equity interest in the properties approximates 5.0%. The aggregate purchase price for the equity interests and the management and leasing business was $32,200,000 (consisting of $28,600,000 in cash and approximately 99,300 Operating Partnership units valued at $3,600,000) and may be increased by up to $9,000,000 based on the performance of the management company. On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5% interest in the planned redevelopment of Waterfront, located at 401 M Street, a mixed use project in Washington D.C. (the Waterfront interest) for $2,171,000, of which the Company paid $1,545,000 in cash and issued 12,500 Operating Partnership units valued at $626,000.

This loan, which is junior to the $1,100,000,000 of loans noted above, is based on a rate of LIBOR plus 12.81% (with a LIBOR floor of 1.5%) and currently yields 14.31%. These loans mature in October 2005, with three one year extensions. Bergen Mall On December 12, 2003, the Company acquired the Bergen Mall for approximately $145,000,000. This purchase was funded as part of a Section 1031 tax free like kind exchange with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Companys Two Park Avenue property. The Bergen Mall is a 903,000 square foot shopping center located on Route 4 East in Paramus, New Jersey. The center is anchored by Macys, Value City, Marshalls and Off Saks Fifth Avenue. The Company intends to expand, re tenant and redevelop the center in order to reposition the asset. On January 27, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to modify the Value City lease to give the Company a one year option to terminate the lease no earlier than one year after notification and upon payment of $12,000,000 to the tenant. The present value of this option is reflected in the acquisition price and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 2003 Dispositions On January 9, 2003, the Company sold its Baltimore, Maryland shopping center for $4,752,000, which resulted in a net gain after closing costs of $2,644,000.

On February 27, 2004, to permit a potential like kind exchange, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest it did not previously own for its partners share of the net sales price (approximately $17,000,000). The Companys gain on sale after closing costs will be approximately $70,000,000. The sale, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2004. 103 2003 Financings On July 3, 2003, the Company entered into a new $600,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which has replaced its $1,000,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which was to mature in July 2003. The new facility has a three year term, a one year extension option and bears interest at LIBOR plus .65%. The Company also has the ability under the new facility to seek up to $800 million of commitments during the facilitys term. The new facility contains financial covenants similar to the prior facility. On November 11, 2003, the Company redeemed of all of its 8.5% Series D 1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units issued in 1998 at a redemption price equal to the par value of $25.00 per unit or an aggregate of $87,500,000 plus accrued distributions of $849,000.

Both the perpetual Preferred Units and perpetual Preferred Shares may be called without penalty at the option of the company commencing in November 2008. On November 25, 2003, the Company completed an offering of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2010. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually on June 1st and December 1st, commencing in 2004. The notes were priced at 99.869% of their face amount to yield 4.772%. The notes contain the same financial covenants that are in the Companys notes issued in June 2002, except the maximum ratio of secured debt to total assets is now 50% (previously 55%). The net proceeds of approximately $198,500,000 were used primarily to repay existing mortgage debt. On January 6, 2004, the Company redeemed all of its 8.375% Series D 2 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units issued in 1999 at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit or an aggregate of $27,500,000 plus accrued distributions of $19,170. 104 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Cash and cash equivalents were $208,200,000 at December 31, 2002, as compared to $265,584,000 at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $57,384,000.

FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a relevant supplemental measure of operating performance because it provides a basis for comparison among REITs. FFO is computed in accordance with NAREITs definition, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with NAREITs definition. Year Ended December 31, 2003 vs. December 31, 2002 FFO was $518,242,000, or $4.44 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $439,775,000, or $3.91 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $78,467,000 or $.53 per share. Income from the straight lining of rents included in FFO amounted to $34,023,000, or $.24 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003, and $27,295,000, or $.24 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002. Income from the amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases included in FFO amounted to $9,047,000, or $.06 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $12,634,000, or $.11 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002.

FIN 46R requires the consolidation of an entity by an enterprise known as a primary beneficiary, (i) if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, if they occur, or both and (ii) if the entity is a variable interest entity (VIE), as defined. An entity qualifies as a variable interest entity if (i) the total equity investment at risk in the entity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or (ii) the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the entity. The initial determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity shall be made as of the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity and re evaluated as of the date of triggering events, as defined. The Company has evaluated each partially owned entity to determine whether any qualify as a VIE, and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, as defined. The Company has determined that its investment in Newkirk MLP, in which it owns a 22.6% equity interest (see Note 5 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report Form 10 K), qualifies as a VIE. The Company has determined that it is not considered the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, consolidation is not required. The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement in Newkirk is limited to its equity investment of approximately $138,762,000, as of December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company has variable interests in certain other entities which are primarily financing arrangements. The Company has evaluated these entities in accordance with FIN 46R and has determined that they are not VIEs. Based on the Companys evaluations, it does not believe that the adoption of FIN 46R will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003, required the Company to reclassify all of its Series F 1 Preferred Units ($10 million liquidation value) from minority interest to a liability on its consolidated balance sheet. In connection therewith, the Company also reclassified $225,000 of payments made to the holders of these units in the three months ended December 31, 2003 as interest expense. On November 7, 2003, the FASB deferred, indefinitely, the application of paragraphs 9 and 10 of SFAS No. 150 as it relates to mandatory redeemable non controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries in order to address a number of interpretation and implementation issues. The Company has determined that one of its consolidated, finite life joint ventures qualifies as a mandatory redeemable non controlling interest. If the Company were required to adopt the provisions of paragraphs 9 and 10 on the statements effective date, the Company would have to reclassify as a liability, amounts included in minority interest of approximately $1.6 million and record the minority partners interest as a liability at its estimated settlement value which would result in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of approximately $15.6 million. This liability would be required to be reviewed each quarter and any changes in its settlement value would be recorded as interest expense. 109 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, beyond the control of the Company. Various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Companys cash flows and earnings. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has an interest rate swap as described in footnote 1 to the table below. In addition, during 2003 the Company purchased two interest rate caps with notional amounts aggregating $295,000,000, and simultaneously sold two interest rate caps with the same aggregate notional amount on substantially the same terms as the caps purchased. As the significant terms of these arrangements are the same, the effects of a revaluation of these instruments are expected to substantially offset one another. Management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The Companys exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly owned and partially owned debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: ($in thousands, except per share amounts) 2003 2002 December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1% Change In Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Wholly owned debt: Variable rate $ 1,270,899 (1) 2.22 % $ 12,708 $ 1,358,126 2.49 % Fixed rate 2,913,486 7.19 % 2,713,194 7.17 % $ 4,184,385 5.68 % 12,708 $ 4,071,320 5.61 % Debt of partially owned entities: Variable rate $ 153,140 3.64 % 1,531 $ 131,100 4.54 % Fixed rate 777,427 7.07 % 917,008 8.41 % $ 930,567 6.51 % 1,531 $ 1,048,108 7.92 % Minority interest (2,994 ) Total decrease in the Companys annual net income $ 11,245 Per share diluted $ .13 (1) Includes $525,279 for the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007, as the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (1.97% if set on December 31, 2003). In accordance with SFAS 133, as amended, accounting for these swaps requires the Company to fair value the debt at each reporting period. At December 31, 2003, the fair value adjustment was $25,780, and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above. The fair value of the Companys debt, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt, exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately $94,953,000 at December 31, 2003. 110
