In addition, the Company has a 47.6% interest in an entity that owns and operates 88 cold storage warehouses nationwide. The Companys business objective is to maximize shareholder value. The Companys measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders. Below is a table comparing the Companys performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the following periods ending December 31, 2004: Total Return(1) Vornado RMS One year 46.5 % 31.5 % Three years 114.8 % 86.4 % Five years 207.3 % 166.6 % Ten years 612.5 % 284.8 %(2) (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how the Company will perform in the future. (2) From inception on July 25, 1995 The Company intends to continue to achieve its business objective by pursuing its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit. Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation. Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents. Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area. Developing/redeveloping the Companys existing properties to increase returns and maximize value. The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. The Companys success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. Economic growth has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending. To the extent economic growth stalls, the Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. Alternatively, if economic growth is sustained, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Companys weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow. 2004 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company completed $328,600,000 of acquisitions and investments in real estate, of which $246,600,000 related to the retail segment. In addition, the Company made $183,400,000 of mezzanine loans during 2004 which increased the outstanding balance of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable to $440,186,000 at December 31, 2004. Following are the details of these transactions. On February 3, 2004, the Company acquired the Forest Plaza Shopping Center for approximately $32,500,000, of which $14,000,000 was paid in cash and $18,500,000 was debt assumed. Forest Plaza is a 165,000 square foot shopping center located in Staten Island, New York. 54 Overview continued On March 19, 2004, the Company acquired a 62,000 square foot free standing retail building located at 25 W. 14th Street in Manhattan for $40,000,000 in cash. On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of the Company, together with family members own approximately 67 percent. The purchase price of $21,500,000 was paid in cash. The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one 10 year extension option. The land under the hotel was acquired in 1999. On July 29, 2004, the Company acquired a real estate portfolio containing 25 supermarkets for $65,000,000 in cash. These properties, all of which are all located in Southern California and contain an aggregate of approximately 766,000 square feet, were purchased from the Newkirk MLP, in which the Company currently owns a 22.4% interest. The supermarkets are net leased to Stater Brothers for an initial term expiring in 2008, with six 5 year extension options. Stater Brothers is a Southern California regional grocery chain that operates 158 supermarkets and has been in business since 1936. On August 30, 2004, the Company acquired a 68,000 square foot free standing building in Forest Hills, New York for $26,500,000 in cash.

The Company contributed $4,462,000 of equity and provided a $24,000,000 bridge loan with interest at 10% per annum. Upon the refinancing of the bridge loan, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, the Company will be repaid $15,106,000 and the balance of $8,894,000 will remain in the venture as additional equity. On November 12, 2004 and December 1, 2004, the Company acquired two shopping centers aggregating 185,000 square feet, in Lodi, New Jersey and Long Island (Inwood), New York, for a total purchase price of $36,600,000 in cash plus $10,900,000 of assumed debt. In December 2004, the Company acquired two retail condominiums aggregating 12,000 square feet, located at 386 and 387 West Broadway in New York City for $16,900,000 in cash plus $4,700,000 of assumed debt. Investment in GMH Communities L.P. On July 20, 2004, the Company committed to make up to a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P. (GMH), a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors. Distributions accrued on the full committed balance of the investment, whether or not drawn, from July 20, 2004, at a rate of 16.27%. In connection with this commitment, the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000. The Company also purchased for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH common equity. These warrants entitle the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units, through May 6, 2006, at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit. As of November 3, 2004, the Company had funded a total of $113,777,000 of the commitment. On November 3, 2004, GCT closed its initial public offering (IPO) at a price of $12.00 per share. GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general partner. In connection with the IPO, the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000 commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000. The Company also exercised warrants to purchase 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or $50,000,000 in total, which resulted in a net gain of $29,500,000. The Company accounts for its interest in the partnership units on the equity method based on its 12.25% ownership interest and right to appoint one of its executive officers to GCTs Board of Trustees. The Company records its pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10 K or 10 Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements. 55 Overview continued Under the warrant agreement, the number of GMH partnership units or GCT common shares underlying the warrants is adjusted for dividends declared by GCT. On December 16, 2004, GCT declared a dividend of $.16 per common share, which increased the number of shares underlying the warrants from 5,496,724 to 5,563,417 and the exercise price was decreased from $9.10 to $8.99 per share. Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains and losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. In the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized income of $24,190,000 from the mark to market of these warrants, which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCTs closing stock price on the NYSE of $14.10 per share on December 31, 2004. Further, in connection with the IPO, the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited partnership units. Of the Companys GMH units, 6,666,667 may be converted into an equivalent number of common shares of GCT commencing on May 2, 2005 and 671,190 units may be converted commencing on November 2, 2005. The Company has agreed not to sell any common shares or units it owns or may acquire until May 2, 2005. Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. In July and August 2004, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share. Included in the cost is $1,361,000 for a performance based participation. These shares are recorded as marketable securities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and are classified as available for sale. Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the Companys consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income. At December 31, 2004, based on Sears closing stock price of $51.03 per share, $18,105,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded net income of $81,730,000, comprised of (i) $88,782,000 from the mark to market of the options on December 31, 2004, based on Sears closing stock price of $51.03 per share and (ii) $2,295,000 for accrued dividends, partially offset by (i) $5,972,000 for a performance based participation, (ii) $2,371,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge and (iii) $1,004,000 of professional fees. On November 16, 2004, Kmart Holding Corporation (Kmart) and Sears entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger. Upon the effective date of the merger, each share of Sears common stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, (i) $50.00 in cash or (ii) 0.50 shares of common stock of the merged company, subject to proration so that 55% of the Sears shares are exchanged for shares of the merged company. Based on Sears most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Companys aggregate investment in Sears represents 4.2% of Sears outstanding common shares. 56 Overview continued 2004 Dispositions In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential Complex, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest in the Palisades venture it did not previously own for approximately $17,000,000 in cash. On June 29, 2004, the Company sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000. On August 12, 2004, the Company sold its Dundalk, Maryland shopping center for $12,900,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $9,850,000. 2004 Financings On January 6, 2004, the Company redeemed all of its 8.375% Series D 2 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit for an aggregate of $27,500,000 plus accrued distributions. On March 17, 2004, the Company redeemed all of its Series B Preferred Shares at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share for an aggregate of $85,000,000 plus accrued dividends. The redemption amount exceeded the carrying amount by $3,195,000, representing the original issuance costs. Upon redemption, these issuance costs were recorded as a reduction to earnings in arriving at net income applicable to common shares, in accordance with the July 2003 EITF clarification of Topic D 42.

See discussion of Crystal City PTO space below. 59 Overview Leasing Activity continued Crystal City PTO Space The PTO vacated 937,000 square feet in Crystal City in the fourth quarter of 2004, of which 497,000 has been taken out of service, and will vacate another 1,002,000 square feet during 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. As of February 1, 2005, the Company has leased 416,000 square feet of the PTO space vacated. Of this space, 262,000 square feet was leased to the Federal Supply Service which will be relocated from 240,000 square feet in other Crystal City buildings, 122,000 square feet was leased to the Public Broadcasting Service and 32,000 square feet was leased to Lockheed Martin. Below is a comparison of the Companys actual leasing activity to the Companys projection for the lease up of this space: Square Feet Leased (in thousands) Period in which rent commences: Projection Actual Through February 1, 2005 Q4 2004 32 Q3 2005 122 Q4 2005 247 Q1 2006 793 262 Q2 2006 404 Q3 2006 252 Q4 2006 98 Q1 2007 145 1,939 416 Straight line rent per square foot for the actual square feet leased is $32.34 as compared to $31.94 projected. Actual tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot is $45.25 as compared to $45.28 projected. The Companys original redevelopment plans for the PTO space included taking Crystal Park One and Crystal Plaza Three and Four out of service. Plans for Crystal Plaza Three and Four have not changed. Current plans for Crystal Park One are to lease its 224,000 square feet to private sector tenants which will not require taking the building out of service, as opposed to leasing it to another government agency which would have required taking it out of service. As a result, the Company will recognize approximately $4,000,000 of expense in 2005, which under the original plan would have been capitalized as part of development costs. 60 Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Companys accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2004, the Companys carrying amount of its real estate, net of accumulated depreciation is $8.3 billion. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The Companys properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Identified Intangible Assets Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts of the Companys identified intangible assets are $176,314,000 and $130,875,000, respectively. Such amounts are included in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company has $71,272,000 and $47,359,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, which are included in deferred credit on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. If these assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles change, the impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements could be material. 61 Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable The Companys policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable was $440,186,000. The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of its loans could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders, was $605,300,000. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. The Company has concluded that it does not have a controlling ownership interest with respect to the Companys 80% interest in Starwood Ceruzzi Venture, and 50% interests in Monmouth Mall, Wells Kinzie, Orleans Hubbard and 825 Seventh Avenue. The Company consolidates entities that it is able to control. The Company accounts for investments on the equity method when its ownership interest is greater than 20% and less than 50%, and the Company does not have direct or indirect control. When partially owned entities are in partnership form, the 20% threshold may be reduced. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Companys share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to and from these entities. All other investments are accounted for on the cost method. On a periodic basis the Company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the Companys investments in partially owned entities are impaired. The ultimate realization of the Companys investment in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions. If the Company determines that a decline in the value of the investee is other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts ($17,339,000 as at December 31, 2004) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement. The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($6,787,000 as at December 31, 2004). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 62 Revenue Recognition The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rents income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. Percentage Rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e. sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenues income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Show Revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue income arising from the Companys investment in Americold. Storage and handling revenue is recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses among other things, its collectibility. If the Companys assessment of the collectibility of its revenue changes, the impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result. 63 Net income and EBITDA(1) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Below is a summary of Net income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. On January 1, 2003, the Company revised its definition of EBITDA to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation G concerning non GAAP financial measures. The revised definition of EBITDA includes minority interest, gains (losses) on the sale of depreciable real estate and income arising from the straight lining of rent and the amortization of acquired in place leases. Accordingly, EBITDA for all periods disclosed represents Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of its segments as it is related to the return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA is not a surrogate for net income because net income is after interest expense and accordingly, is a measure of return on equity as opposed to return on assets.

EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2003, includes the Companys $9,900 share of gains on sale of real estate and early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by a charge of $1,210 for an impairment loss and a litigation settlement. The remaining decrease in EBITDA from 2003 to 2004 is due primarily to the sale of properties (primarily Stater Brothers Supermarkets). (B) Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2004, includes a gain of $7,494, resulting from the exercise of an option by the Companys joint venture partner to acquire certain MLP units held by the Company. The MLP units subject to this option had been issued to the Company on behalf of the Companys joint venture partner in exchange for the Companys operating partnership units as part of the tender offers to acquire certain of the units of the MLP in 1998 and 1999. (C) Includes Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation expense, of which the Companys share was $25,340, $14,868 and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2004, also includes the Companys $1,274 share of a gain on sale of land parcel and the Companys $1,010 share of Alexanders loss on early extinguishment of debt. (D) The Companys share of EBITDA for the period from November 3, 2004 to December 31, 2004, will be recognized in the quarter ended March 31, 2005, as the investee has not published its earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 prior to the filing of the Companys annual report on Form 10 K.

This increase is primarily due to (i) $6,379,000 resulting from the consolidation of the Companys investment in Americold Realty Trust from November 18, 2004 vs. equity method accounting prior, (ii) $7,411,000 from an increase in average outstanding debt balances, primarily due to the issuance of $250,000,000 and $200,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in August 2004 and November 2003, respectively, and (iii) $1,206,000 from an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total debt of three basis points.

(3) Reflects increases of $12,953 from New York City Office leasing activity and $3,413 from CESCRs leasing activity. These increases resulted primarily from higher rents for space relet in 2003 and 2002 (full year impact in 2003 as compared to a partial year in 2002) and an increase in CESCR occupancy of .3% this year, partially offset by a decrease in NYC office occupancy of .6%.

Initial rents for the 1,157 square feet of showroom space relet in 2003 was $23.43, a 0.6% increase over prior escalated rent.

(7) Results primarily from a $3,444 decrease in CESCR third party leasing revenue from $7,100 in 2002 to $3,656 in 2003 as a result of the closing of one of the CESCR leasing offices. 78 Expenses The Companys expenses were $917,086,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $850,071,000 in the prior year, an increase of $67,015,000.

(2) Results primarily from the rescheduling of two trade shows from the fourth quarter of 2002, in which they were previously held to the first quarter of 2003, and due to a new trade show held for the first time in 2003. (3) Below are the details of the increases (decreases) in operating expenses by segment: Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other Real estate taxes $ 26,935 $ 20,904 (a) $ 1,245 $ 4,724 $ 62 Utilities (946 ) (906 ) 364 (483 ) 79 Maintenance 5,286 2,997 2,302 (33 ) 20 Ground rent 950 1,005 (55 ) Bad debt expense (29 ) (1,541 ) 1,238 274 Other 71 1,293 (139 ) (958 ) (125 ) $ 32,267 $ 23,752 $ 4,955 $ 3,524 $ 36 (a) Relates primarily to an increase in New York Office. (4) Increases in depreciation and amortization for the Office and Merchandise Mart segments are primarily due to additions to buildings and improvements. (5) The increase in general and administrative expenses results from: Increase in professional fees in connection with information technology, corporate governance, insurance, and other projects $ 4,675 Severance payments in 2003 to two senior executives ($3,211) and the non cash charge related to the accelerated vesting of their restricted stock ($1,626) 4,837 Other severance 860 Increase in corporate payroll and fringe benefits of which $755 is due to a decrease in capitalized development payroll and $407 is due to the Companys deferred compensation plan (offset by an equal amount of investment income) 2,872 Costs in connection with the relocation of CESCRs back office operations to the Companys administrative headquarters in New Jersey 1,123 Stock compensation expense (see below) 1,898 Other 642 $ 16,907 As part of the 2002 annual compensation review, in lieu of stock options, on January 28, 2003 the Company granted 166,990 restricted shares at $34.50 per share (the then closing stock price on the NYSE) to employees of the Company. These awards vest over a 5 year period. Stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. In the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $1,898,000 (excluding severance charges), of which $1,020,000 related to January 2003 restricted stock awards. 80 Income Applicable to Alexanders Income applicable to Alexanders (interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $15,574,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $29,653,000 in the prior year, a decrease of $14,079,000. This decrease resulted primarily from (i) Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation expense of which the Companys share was $14,868,000 in 2003 compared to zero in 2002, partially offset by (ii) Alexanders gain on the sale of its Third Avenue property of which the Companys share was $3,524,000 in 2002, and (iii) income resulting from the commencement of the lease with Bloomberg (87% of the space) on November 15, 2003 at Alexanders 731 Lexington Avenue property of which the Companys share was $1,589,000. Income from Partially Owned Entities Below are the condensed statements of operations of the Companys unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as the increase (decrease) in income from these partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: (Amounts in thousands) For the year ended: Total Newkirk MLP Temperature Controlled Logistics Monmouth Mall Partially Owned Office Buildings Starwood Ceruzzi Joint Venture Las Catalinas Mall Other December 31, 2003: Revenues $ 273,500 $ 119,605 $ 24,121 $ 99,590 $ 4,394 Expenses: Operating, general and administrative (15,357 ) (6,905 ) (10,520 ) (39,724 ) (3,381 ) Depreciation (51,777 ) (56,778 ) (4,018 ) (18,491 ) (998 ) Interest expense (97,944 ) (41,117 ) (6,088 ) (27,548 ) Other, net 43,083 5,710 (3,220 ) 2,516 (866 ) Net income (loss) $ 151,505 $ 20,515 $ 275 $ 16,343 $ (851 ) Vornados interest 22.6 % 60 % 50 % 15 % 80 % Equity in net income (loss) $ 51,057 $ 33,243 (1) $ 12,869 (2) $ 138 $ 2,426 $ (681 ) $ 3,062 Interest and other income 10,292 7,002 3,290 (3) Fee income 6,552 5,547 1,005 Income (loss) from partially owned entities $ 67,901 $ 40,245 $ 18,416 $ 4,433 $ 2,426 $ (681 ) N/A (4) $ 3,062 December 31, 2002: Revenues $ 295,369 $ 117,663 $ 5,760 $ 50,205 $ 695 $ 10,671 Expenses: Operating, general and administrative (8,490 ) (7,904 ) (2,510 ) (21,827 ) (2,265 ) (3,102 ) Depreciation (34,010 ) (59,328 ) (943 ) (9,094 ) (1,430 ) (1,482 ) Interest expense (121,219 ) (42,695 ) (1,520 ) (11,354 ) (3,643 ) Other, net (9,790 ) (2,150 ) 48 389 (200 ) (802 ) Net income (loss) $ 121,860 $ 5,586 $ 835 $ 8,319 $ (3,200 ) $ 1,642 Vornados interest 21.7 % 60 % 50 % 24 % 80 % 50 % Equity in net income (loss) $ 30,664 $ 26,500 $ 4,144 $ 791 (3) $ 1,966 $ (2,560 ) $ 851 $ (1,028 ) Interest and other income 8,000 8,000 Fee income 5,794 5,563 231 Income (loss) from partially owned entities $ 44,458 $ 34,500 $ 9,707 $ 1,022 $ 1,966 $ (2,560 ) $ 851 $ (1,028 ) Increase (decrease) in income from partially owned entities $ 23,443 $ 5,745 (1) $ 8,709 (2) $ 3,411 (3) $ 460 $ 1,879 $ (851 (4) $ 4,090 See notes on following page. 81 Notes to preceding tabular information: (1) The increase reflects the Companys share of the following items from the Newkirk MLP in 2003 including (i) $7,200 of net gains on the sale of 11 properties, (ii) a gain of $1,600 on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by, (iii) a charge of $538 in connection with a litigation claim, (iv) a charge of $353 for an asset impairment and (v) $930 in Federal and state taxes. (2) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships (the Landlord) rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent was $49,436 at December 31, 2003. The following summarizes the increase in income for the year ended December 31, 2003 over the prior year: Increase in rent from Tenant $ 1,220 Decrease in general and administrative expenses 544 Gain on sale of real estate in 2003 ($486) as compared to a loss on sale of real estate in 2002 ($2,026) 2,512 Income tax refund received in 2003 1,345 Decrease in depreciation and interest expense and other 3,088 $ 8,709 (3) The Company acquired a 50% interest in the Monmouth Mall on October 10, 2002. Equity in net income of the Monmouth Mall includes the Companys preferred return of $3,290 and $748 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. (4) On September 23, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of the Mall and 25% of the Kmart anchor store it did not previously own. Accordingly, the operations of Las Catalinas are consolidated into the accounts of the Company subsequent to September 23, 2002. 82 Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $25,397,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $31,678,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $6,281,000. This decrease resulted primarily from (i) lower average investments at lower yields, partially offset by (ii) $5,655,000 of contingent interest income recognized in connection with the repayment of the Dearborn Center loan and (iii) $5,028,000 of interest income recognized on the $225,000,000 GM Building mezzanine loans, for the period from October 20, 2003 through December 31, 2003. Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $228,860,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $232,891,000 in the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease of $4,031,000. This decrease was primarily comprised of a $11,285,000 savings from a 77 basis point reduction in weighted average interest rates of the Companys variable rate debt, partially offset by (i) the consolidation as of September 2002 of the Las Catalinas operations which were previously included in income from partially owned entities, (ii) a full year of interest expense on the Companys $500,000,000 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 which were issued in June 2002 and (iii) a reduction in interest capitalized in connection with development projects. Net (Loss) Gain on Disposition of Wholly owned and Partially owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate The following table sets forth the details of net (loss) gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: For the Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2003 2002 Wholly owned Assets: Net gain on sale of marketable securities $ 2,950 $ 12,346 Loss on settlement of Primestone guarantees (2003) and foreclosure and impairment losses (2002) (1,388 ) (35,757 ) Gain on sale of land parcels 499 Gain on sale of residential condominiums units 282 2,156 Gain on transfer of mortgages 2,096 Net gain on sale of air rights 1,688 $ 2,343 $ (17,471 ) Primestone Foreclosure and Impairment Losses On September 28, 2000, the Company made a $62,000,000 loan to Primestone Investment Partners, L.P. (Primestone). The loan bore interest at 16% per annum. Primestone defaulted on the repayment of this loan on October 25, 2001. The loan was subordinate to $37,957,000 of other debt of the borrower that liened the Companys collateral. On October 31, 2001, the Company purchased the other debt for its face amount. The loans were secured by 7,944,893 partnership units in Prime Group Realty, L.P., the operating partnership of Prime Group Realty Trust (NYSE:PGE) and the partnership units are exchangeable for the same number of common shares of PGE. The loans were also guaranteed by affiliates of Primestone. On November 19, 2001, the Company sold, pursuant to a participation agreement with a subsidiary of Cadim inc., a Canadian pension fund, a 50% participation in both loans at par for approximately $50,000,000 reducing the Companys net investment in the loans at December 31, 2001 to $56,768,000 including unpaid interest and fees of $6,790,000. The participation did not meet the criteria for sale accounting under SFAS 140 because Cadim was not free to pledge or exchange the assets. 83 On April 30, 2002, the Company and Cadim acquired the 7,944,893 partnership units at a foreclosure auction. The price paid for the units by application of a portion of Primestones indebtedness to the Company and Cadim was $8.35 per unit, the April 30, 2002 closing price of shares of PGE on the New York Stock Exchange. On June 28, 2002, pursuant to the terms of the participation agreement, the Company transferred 3,972,447 of the partnership units to Cadim. In the second quarter of 2002, in accordance with foreclosure accounting, the Company recorded a loss on the Primestone foreclosure of $17,671,000 calculated based on (i) the acquisition price of the units and (ii) its valuation of the amounts realizable under the guarantees by affiliates of Primestone, as compared with the net carrying amount of the investment at April 30, 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2,229,000 write down on its investment based on costs expended to realize the value of the guarantees. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $15,857,000 write down of its investment in Prime Group consisting of (i) $14,857,000 to adjust the carrying amount of the Prime Group units to $4.61 per unit, the closing price of PGE shares on the New York Stock Exchange at December 31, 2002 and (ii) $1,000,000 for estimated costs to realize the value of the guarantees. The Company considered the decline in the value of the units which are convertible into stock to be other than temporary as of December 31, 2002, based on the fact that the market value of the stock had been less than its cost for more than six months, the severity of the decline, market trends, the financial condition and near term prospects of Prime Group and other relevant factors. At December 31, 2002, the Companys carrying amount of the investment was $23,908,000, of which $18,313,000 represents the carrying amount of the 3,972,447 partnership units owned by the Company ($4.61 per unit), $6,100,000 represents the amount expected to be realized under the guarantees, partially offset by $1,005,000 representing the Companys share of Prime Groups net loss through September 30, 2002, as the Company recorded its share of Prime Groups earnings on a one quarter lag basis. On June 11, 2003, the Company exercised its right to exchange the 3,972,447 units it owned in Prime Group Realty L.P. for 3,972,447 common shares in Prime Group Realty Trust. Prior to the exchange, the Company accounted for its investment in the partnership on the equity method. Subsequent to the exchange, the Company is accounting for its investment in PGE as a marketable equity security available for sale, as the Companys shares represent less than a 20% ownership interest in PGE (which is not a partnership), the Company does not have significant influence and the common shares have a readily determinable fair value. Accordingly, the carrying amount previously included in Investments and Advances to Partially Owned Entities was reclassified to Marketable Securities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company is also required to mark these securities to market based on the closing price of the PGE shares on the NYSE at the end of each reporting period. For the period from June 11, 2003 through December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $6,623,000 unrealized gain, which is not included in the Companys net income, but is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the Shareholders Equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. From the date of exchange, income recognition is limited to dividends received on the PGE shares. On June 13, 2003, the Company received its $5,000,000 share of a settlement with affiliates of Primestone Investment Partners of the amounts due under the guarantees of the Primestone loans. In connection therewith, the Company recognized a $1,388,000 loss on settlement of the guarantees, which has been reflected as a component of net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets in the Companys 2003 consolidated statement of income. Gain on Transfer of Mortgages In the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain of $2,096,000 resulting from payments to the Company by third parties that assumed certain of the Companys mortgages. Under these transactions the Company paid to the third parties that assumed the Companys obligations the outstanding amounts due under the mortgages and the third parties paid the Company for the benefit of assuming the mortgages. The Company has been released by the creditors underlying these loans. Net Gain on Sale of Air Rights In 2002, the Company constructed a $16.3 million community facility and low income residential housing development (the 30th Street Venture), in order to receive 163,728 square feet of transferable development rights, generally referred to as air rights. The Company donated the building to a charitable organization. The Company sold 106,796 square feet of these air rights to third parties at an average price of $120 per square foot. An additional 28,821 square feet of air rights was sold to Alexanders at a price of $120 per square foot for use at Alexanders 59th Street development project (the 59th Street Project). In each case, the Company received cash in exchange for air rights. The Company identified third party buyers for the remaining 28,111 square feet of air rights of the 30th Street Venture. These third party buyers wanted to use the air rights 84 for the development of two projects located in the general area of 86th Street which was not within the required geographical radius of the construction site nor in the same Community Board as the low income housing and community facility project. The 30th Street Venture asked Alexanders to sell 28,111 square feet of the air rights it already owned to the third party buyers (who could use them) and the 30th Street Venture would replace them with 28,111 square feet of air rights. In October 2002, the Company sold 28,111 square feet of air rights to Alexanders for an aggregate sales price of $3,059,000 (an average of $109 per square foot). Alexanders then sold an equal amount of air rights to the third party buyers for an aggregate sales price of $3,339,000 (an average of $119 per square foot). Net Gains on Sale of Residential Condominium Units The Company recognized net gains of $282,000 and $2,156,000 during 2003 and 2002, from the sale of residential condominiums. Minority Interest Minority interest was $178,937,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $140,933,000 for the prior year, an increase of $38,040,000. The increase is primarily due to higher income in 2003, primarily as a result of net gains on sale of real estate of $161,789,000, and an increase in preferred unit distributions of $2,187,000, representing the original issuance costs on the redemption of the Series D 1 preferred units. Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation. The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2003 and 2002.

On October 10, 2003, the Company sold Two Park Avenue, a 965,000 square foot office building, for $292,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on the sale after closing costs of $156,433,000. On November 3, 2003, the Company sold its Hagerstown, Maryland shopping center for $3,100,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $1,945,000. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In September 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (effective January 1, 2002). SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead be subject to periodic impairment testing. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company wrote off goodwill of approximately $30,129,000 of which (i) $15,490,000 represents its share of the goodwill arising from the Companys investment in Temperature Controlled Logistics and (ii) $14,639,000 represents goodwill arising from the Companys acquisition of the Hotel Pennsylvania. The write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the 2002 consolidated statement income. EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA. (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Other Year ended December 31, 2002 $ 826,659 $ 610,531 $ 114,498 $ 108,078 $ 69,798 $ (76,246 ) 2003 Operations: Same store operations(1) 5,670 5,086 4,445 3,517 (3) Acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses 164,488 24,535 5,364 4,650 Year ended December 31, 2003 $ 1,037,896 $ 780,689 $ 144,119 $ 117,887 $ 77,965 $ (82,764 ) % increase in same store operations 1.0 %(2) 4.5 % 4.1 % 4.8 %(3) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses above. (2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $488,419 ($331,886 excluding gains on sale of real estate of $156,533) and 3.3% (excluding such gains) for the New York office portfolio and $292,270 and (1.7%) for the CESCR portfolio. 36% of the same store decrease at CESCR reflects a reduction in third party net leasing fees. (3) The Company reflects its 60% share of Vornado Crescent Portland Partnerships (the Landlord) rental income it receives from AmeriCold Logistics, its tenant, which leases the underlying temperature controlled warehouses used in its business. The Companys joint venture does not recognize rental income unless earned and collection is assured or cash is received. The Company did not recognize $25,087 of rent it was due for the year ended December 31, 2003, which together with previously deferred rent is $49,436. The tenant has advised the Landlord that (i) its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the warehouses it leases from the Landlord, is lower than last year by 1.3%, and (ii) its gross profit before rent at these warehouses for the corresponding period is higher than last year by $607 (a 0.4% increase). In addition, in 2003, the tenant and the Landlord had lower general and administrative expenses and the Landlord received $885 of EBITDA from its investment in the quarries it acquired in December 2002 which was reflected in the gross profit of the tenant in the prior year. 86 Supplemental Information Three Months Ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 Below is a summary of Net Income and EBITDA(1) by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) Interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization included in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA reflects amounts which are netted in income from partially owned entities. (3) Operating results for the year ended December 31, 2004, reflect the consolidation of the Companys investment in Americold beginning on November 18, 2004. Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method. See page 92 for condensed proforma operating results of Americold for the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003.

Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2003. (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Other Three months ended December 31, 2003 $ 357,882 $ 310,418 $ 37,691 $ 31,234 $ 22,093 $ (43,554 ) 2004 Operations: Same store operations(1) 2,872 2,223 2,829 (3) Acquisitions, dispositions and non recurring income and expenses (154,119 ) 7,568 (130 ) (5,160 ) Three months ended December 31, 2004 $ 397,635 $ 159,171 $ 47,482 $ 33,933 $ 16,933 $ 140,116 % increase in same store operations 1.9 %(2) 6.2 % 9.7 %(3) N/A %(4) (1) Represents operations, which were owned for the same period in each year.

(3) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of leases with WPP Group (228,000 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times (127,000 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004, exclusive of the incremental impact of these leases was $31,844, representing a 2.5% same store percentage increase.

Americold owns 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics. On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company (CEI) collectively sold 20.7% of Americolds common shares to The Yucaipa Companies (Yucaipa) for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Companys share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations. Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries. Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa. Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may earn a promote of 20% of the increase in the value of Americold through December 31, 2007, limited to 10% of the Companys and CEIs remaining interest in Americold; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027. CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2007, discounted at 10%. In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved. The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americolds Board of Trustees. Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method. The following is a pro forma presentation of the results of operations of Americold for the three months and years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, giving effect to the acquisition of AmeriCold Logistics as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003. For the Year Ended December 31, For the Three Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2004 2003 2004 2003 Revenue $ 701,707 $ 655,286 $ 191,595 $ 176,610 Cost of operations 545,971 482,284 146,694 128,390 Gross margin 155,736 173,002 44,901 48,220 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 72,059 71,860 17,666 17,950 Interest expense 52,285 41,634 13,799 10,440 General and administrative expense 32,940 35,355 6,946 10,426 Other expense (income), net 11,137 (601 ) 5,879 (1,778 ) Net (loss) income (12,685 ) 24,754 611 11,182 Depreciation and amortization 71,622 71,386 17,567 17,836 Interest expense 52,285 41,634 13,799 10,440 Income taxes 4,640 1,989 775 (1,344) EBITDA $ 115,867 $ 139,763 $ 32,752 $ 38,114 Same store % increase (decrease) (5.3 )% .8 % Revenue was $701,707,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $655,286,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $46,421,000. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to (i) $36,406,000 from Americolds transportation management services business from both new and existing customers, (ii) $6,692,000 from new managed warehouse contracts, net of a contract termination in the fourth quarter of 2004 and (iii) an increase in handling and accessorial services. 92 Gross margin from owned warehouses was $150,515,000 or 34.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $159,909,000, or 36.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $9,394,000. This decrease was primarily attributable to (i) lower productivity related to new business at the Atlanta warehouses, (ii) lower average occupancy at the Carthage warehouse and (iii) a change in revenue mix as higher margin storage revenues declined and lower margin handling revenues increased. Gross margin from other operations (i.e., transportation, management services and managed warehouses) was $5,221,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $13,093,000 for the year ended for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $7,872,000. This decrease was primarily the result of (i) a $5,062,000 change in the estimate of unbilled transportation revenue, (ii) lower margins in the transportation management services business due to tightened truck supply in 2004 as a result of new legislation reducing the hours that drivers are permitted to drive in a day, partially offset by (iii) an increase in gross margin from new and existing managed warehouse customers. Interest expense was $52,285,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $41,634,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $10,651,000. The increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding as Americold obtained a mortgage financing on 28 of its unencumbered properties in February 2004. General and administrative expense was $32,940,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $35,355,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,415,000. This decrease resulted primarily from a lower bonus provision. Other expense, net, was $11,137,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to other income, net, of $601,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, a decrease of $11,738,000. This decrease resulted primarily from (i) $7,569,000 for the write off of the remaining net book value of two vacant warehouse facilities and assets related to a managed warehouse contract that was terminated 2004, (ii) $2,241,000 of income in 2003 resulting from a tax refund, and (iii) a gain of $850,000 in 2003 resulting from a sale of warehouse. 93 Related Party Transactions Loan and Compensation Agreements In accordance with the terms of the employment arrangement with Steven Roth, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, and subject to a letter agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans on a revolving basis. Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan. Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance under this arrangement was $13,122,500 (of which $4,704,500 is shown as a reduction in shareholders equity). The amount outstanding matures in January 2006 and bears interest at a weighted average rate of 4.49% per annum. At December 31, 2004, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Companys President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000. The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate). Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed). The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002. The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares. The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense. Pursuant to the Companys annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement. The loan bears interest at 1.57% per annum (the Federal rate) and is due in March 2007. On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Companys stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Companys common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price. In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement. Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company Alexanders The Company owns 33% of Alexanders. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are Officers and Directors of Alexanders, the Company provides various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements and the Company has made loans to Alexanders aggregating $124,000,000 at December 31, 2004. These agreements and the loans are described in Note 5 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to the Companys consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. In addition, in 2002, the Company sold air rights to Alexanders, details of which are provided in Note 3 Acquisitions and Dispositions to the Companys consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. 94 Interstate Properties As of December 31, 2004, Interstate Properties and its partners beneficially owned approximately 10.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.4% of Alexanders common stock. Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexanders. Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexanders. The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. The Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company earned $726,000, $703,000 and $747,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In addition, during fiscal years 2003 and 2002, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexanders, Alexanders paid to Interstate $587,000 and $703,000, respectively, for the leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company. Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexanders thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company. Vornado Operating Company (Vornado Operating) In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. Vornado Operatings primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company. The Company granted Vornado Operating a $75,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire on December 31, 2004. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 3%. The Company received a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the facility. At the time of its dissolution referred to below, Vornado Operating had outstanding 4,068,924 shares and its operating partnership had outstanding 447,017 units. At such time, trustees and officers of the Company held approximately 24.3% of the common shares and units of Vornado Operating. In addition, Messrs. Roth, Fascitelli, Macnow, Wight and West each served as an officer and or director of Vornado Operating. On December 31, 2002, the Company and Crescent Real Estate Equities formed a joint venture to acquire the Carthage, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas quarries from AmeriCold Logistics for $20,000,000 in cash (appraised value). The Company contributed cash of $8,800,000 to the joint venture representing its 44% interest. AmeriCold Logistics used the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of a loan to Vornado Operating. Vornado Operating then repaid $9,500,000 of the amount outstanding under the Companys revolving credit facility. In addition, during 2004 and 2003, this joint venture acquired $21,930,000 and $5,720,000 of trade receivables from AmeriCold Logistics for $21,500,000 and $5,606,000, respectively. These receivables were subsequently collected in full. On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of the loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest. Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004. In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating Company (Vornado Operating), its directors and the Company. The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold Realty Trust (owned 60% by the Company) and damages. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties. On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4.5 million or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The proposed settlement payment would be in addition to the liquidation distribution of $2 per Vornado Operating share or unit that Vornado Operating made to its equity holders when it dissolved on December 29, 2004. On January 20, 2005, the Delaware Court of Chancery postponed deciding upon the proposed settlement and requested further but limited information before holding an additional hearing regarding the settlement, which has been scheduled for March 2005. The Company has accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 95 Other On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Companys Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David R. Greenbaum, an executive officer of the Company. The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002 for services rendered to the Companys Manhattan office properties. Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company. On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, together with family members owned approximately 24 percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith was a general partner. On August 5, 2003, the Company repaid the mortgage of $29,056,000. On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5% interest in the planned redevelopment of Waterfront, located at 401 M Street, a mixed use project in Washington D.C. for $2,171,000, of which the Company paid $1,545,000 in cash and issued 12,500 Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units valued at $626,000. The partnership units were issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the partners in the Waterfront interest, and the President of the Companys CESCR division. On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of the Company, together with family members own approximately 67 percent. The purchase price of $21,500,000 was paid in cash. The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one 10 year extension option. The land under the hotel was acquired in 1999. On October 1, 2004, the Company increased its ownership interest in the Investment Building in Washington, D.C. to 5% by acquiring an additional 2.8% interest for $2,240,000 in cash. The Companys original interest in the property was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Kaempfer Company in April 2003. Mitchell N. Schear, President of the Companys CESCR division and other former members of Kaempfer management were also partners in the Investment Building partnership. During 2002, the Company paid approximately $147,000 for legal services to a firm in which one of the Companys trustees is a member. 96 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with existing cash balances will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from borrowings or equity offerings. As at December 31, 2004, the Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $397,990,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $1,550,770,000 of debt securities. On January 26, 2005, the Company filed a registration statement to increase the amount of equity and debt securities that can be offered to up to $2.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. On February 3, 2005, the registration statement was declared effective. Certain Future Cash Requirements For 2005 the Company has budgeted approximately $180,000,000 for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows: (Amounts in millions except square foot data) Total New York Office CESCR Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other(1) Expenditures to maintain assets $ 57.5 $ 16.0 $ 21.0 $ 4.0 $ 10.0 $ 6.5 Tenant improvements 101.5 22.0 60.5 6.0 13.0 Leasing commissions 24.5 7.0 13.0 1.5 3.0 Total Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions 126.0 29.0 73.5 7.5 16.0 Per square foot $ 40.00 $ 28.25 $ 9.10 $ 13.60 $ Per square foot per annum $ 4.20 $ 5.65 $ 0.90 $ 2.25 $ Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions $ 183.5 $ 45.0 $ 94.5 $ 11.5 $ 26.0 $ 6.5 Square feet budgeted to be leased (in thousands) 725 2,600 825 1,175 Weighted average lease term 9.5 5.0 10.0 6.0 (1) Hotel Pennsylvania, Paramus Office and Warehouses. During the year ended December 31, 2004, actual cash basis capital expenditures and leasing commissions were $186,850,000, as compared to a budget of $194,200,000. In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $470,000,000. Of this amount $310,000,000 is estimated to be expended in 2005. The table above excludes Americolds 2005 budget of $23,000,000 for capital expenditures as Americold is expected to fund these expenditures without contributions from the Company. In addition, no cash requirements have been budgeted for the capital expenditures of Alexanders, Newkirk MLP, or any other entity that is partially owned by the Company. These investees are also expected to fund their own cash requirements. 97 Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations Below is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2004. (Amounts in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations: Mortgages and Notes Payable (principal and interest) $ 5,464,579 $ 402,556 $ 1,302,976 $ 1,405,875 $ 2,353,172 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 544,916 12,850 532,066 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 302,026 11,250 22,500 268,276 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 256,779 9,500 19,000 19,000 209,279 Operating leases 1,030,448 20,427 40,902 40,900 928,219 Purchase obligations, primarily construction commitments 49,200 49,200 Capital lease obligations 69,658 17,722 18,288 13,741 19,907 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 7,717,606 $ 523,505 $ 1,935,732 $ 1,747,792 $ 3,510,577 Commitments: Capital commitments to partially owned entities $ 9,696 $ 9,696 $ $ $ Standby Letters of Credit 32,306 31,986 320 Other Guarantees Total Commitments $ 42,002 $ 41,682 $ 320 $ $ At December 31, 2004, the Company has $567,851,000 available under its $600,000,000 revolving credit facility ($32,149,000 was utilized for letters of credit), which matures in July 2006. Further, the Company has a number of properties that are unencumbered. The Companys credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization. The facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Companys ratings below Baa3/BBB. This facility also contains customary events of default that could give rise to acceleration and include such items as failure to pay interest or principal and breaches of financial covenants such as maintenance of minimum capitalization and minimum interest coverage. The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 which expires in 2005 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets. In April 2004, the Company reviewed its all risk policies and increased its coverage for Acts of Terrorism for each of its New York Office, CESCR Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions. Below is a summary of the all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance for each of the Companys business segments: Coverage Per Occurrence All Risk(1) Sub Limits for Acts of Terrorism New York Office $ 1,400,000,000 $ 750,000,000 CESCR Office 1,400,000,000 750,000,000 Retail 500,000,000 500,000,000 Merchandise Mart 1,400,000,000 750,000,000 Temperature Controlled Logistics 225,000,000 225,000,000 (1) Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub limit shown in the adjacent column. In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. The Companys debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 and its revolving credit agreement, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is not extended; it could adversely affect the Companys ability to finance and or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio. In conjunction with the closing of Alexanders Lexington Avenue construction loan on July 3, 2002, the Company agreed to guarantee to the construction lender, the lien free, timely completion of the construction of the project and funding of all project costs in excess of a stated budget, as defined in the loan agreement, if not funded by Alexanders. 98 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Cash and cash equivalents were $599,282,000 at December 31, 2004, as compared to $320,542,000 at December 31, 2003, an increase of $278,740,000.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Companys Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 16 Income per Share, in the Companys notes to consolidated financial statements on page 153 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $750,043,000, or $5.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $518,242,000, or $4.44 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $231,801,000 or $1.19 per share. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $299,441,000 or $2.22 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2004, compared to $130,729,000, or $1.08 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $168,712,000 or $1.14 per share.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, beyond the control of the Company. Various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Companys cash flows and earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has an interest rate swap as described in footnote 1 to the table below. In addition, during 2003 the Company purchased two interest rate caps with notional amounts aggregating $295,000,000, and simultaneously sold two interest rate caps with the same aggregate notional amount on substantially the same terms as the caps purchased. As the significant terms of these arrangements are the same, the effects of a revaluation of these instruments are expected to substantially offset one another. Management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The Companys exposure to a change in interest rates on its consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: 2004 2003 ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1% Change In Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Consolidated debt: Variable rate(1) $ 1,114,981 3.45 % $ 11,150 $ 1,270,899 2.22 % Fixed rate 3,841,530 6.68 % 2,906,566 7.19 % $ 4,956,511 5.95 % 11,150 $ 4,177,465 5.68 % Debt of non consolidated entities: Variable rate $ 122,007 4.67 % 1,220 $ 153,140 3.64 % Fixed rate 547,935 6.73 % 777,427 7.07 % $ 669,942 6.36 % 1,220 $ 930,567 6.51 % Minority interest (1,583 ) Total change in the Companys annual net income $ 10,787 Per share diluted $ .08 (1) Includes $512,791 and $525,279, respectively, for the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007, as the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (2.57% at December 31, 2004). In accordance with SFAS No. 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, accounting for these swaps requires the Company to fair value the debt at each reporting period. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value adjustment was $13,148 and $25,780, and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above. The fair value of the Companys debt, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt, exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately $256,518,000 at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has mezzanine loans receivable of $440,186,000. The Company receives interest on these loans based on a floating rate (a fixed spread plus 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR). The Company believes that a portion of its exposure to a change in interest rates on its floating rate debt, as illustrated above, is mitigated by the outstanding balances of these loans receivable. 105 Derivative Instruments As of December 31, 2004, the Company has the following derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment: The Company has an economic interest in 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded net income of $81,730,000, comprised of (i) $88,782,000 from the mark to market of the options on December 31, 2004, based on Sears closing stock price of $51.03 per share and (ii) $2,295,000 for accrued dividends, partially offset by (i) $5,972,000 for a performance based participation, (ii) $2,371,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge and (iii) $1,004,000 of professional fees. Under a warrant agreement with GMH Communities L.P., the Companys holds 5.6 million warrants to purchase partnership units of GMH at an adjusted exercise price of $8.99 per share. Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. In the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized income of $24,190,000 from the mark to market of these warrants based on GCTs closing stock price on the NYSE of $14.10 per share on December 31, 2004. 106
