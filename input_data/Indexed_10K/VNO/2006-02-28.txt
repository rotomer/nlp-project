In addition, the Company has a 47.6% interest in an entity that owns and operates 85 cold storage warehouses nationwide and a 32.95% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related investments. The Companys business objective is to maximize shareholder value. The Company measures its success in meeting this objective by the total return to its shareholders. Below is a table comparing the Companys performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the following periods ending December 31, 2005: Total Return (1) Vornado RMS One year 14.8 % 12.1 % Three years 157.3 % 101.6 % Five years 184.6 % 135.8 % Ten years 638.2 % 282.1 %(2) (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how the Company will perform in the future. (2) From inception on July 25, 1995 The Company intends to achieve its business objective by continuing to pursue its investment philosophy and executing its operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, D.C., where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; Investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies. The Company competes with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. The Companys success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. Economic growth has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending. To the extent economic growth stalls, the Company may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. Alternatively, if economic growth is sustained, the Company may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in the Companys weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow. The Companys net income and funds from operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the Toys business and competition from discount and mass merchandisers. 2005 Acquisitions and Investments On March 5, 2005, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a venture that owns Beverly Connection, a two level urban shopping center, containing 322,000 square feet, located in Los Angeles, California for $10,700,000 in cash. The Company also provided the venture with a $59,500,000 first mortgage loan which bore interest at 10% through its scheduled maturity in February 2006 and $35,000,000 of preferred equity yielding 13.5% for up to a three year term, which is subordinate to $37,200,000 of other preferred equity and debt. On February 11, 2006, $35,000,000 of the Companys loan to the venture was converted to additional preferred equity on the same terms as the Companys existing preferred equity. The balance of the loan of $24,500,000 was extended to April 11, 2006 and bears interest at 10%. The shopping center is anchored by CompUSA, Old Navy and Sports Chalet. The venture is redeveloping the existing retail and plans, subject to governmental approvals, to develop residential condominiums and assisted living facilities. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company records its pro rata share of net income or loss in Beverly Connection on a one month lag basis as the Company files its consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time the venture reports its earnings. 57 Overview continued On May 20, 2005, the Company acquired the retail condominium of the former Westbury Hotel in Manhattan, consisting of the entire block front on Madison Avenue between 69th Street and 70th Street, for $113,000,000 in cash. Simultaneously with the closing, the Company placed an $80,000,000 mortgage loan on the property bearing interest at 5.292% and maturing in 2018. The property contains approximately 17,000 square feet and is fully occupied by luxury retailers, Cartier, Chloe and Gucci under leases that expire in 2018. The operations of this asset are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition. On June 13, 2005, the Company acquired the 90% that it did not already own of the Bowen Building, a 231,000 square foot class A office building located at 875 15th Street N.W. in the Central Business District of Washington, D.C. The purchase price was $119,000,000, consisting of $63,000,000 in cash and $56,000,000 of existing mortgage debt, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, (5.66% as of December 31, 2005) and is due in February 2007.

On July 25, 2005, the Company acquired a property located at Madison Avenue and East 66th Street in Manhattan for $158,000,000 in cash.

On August 26, 2005, a joint venture in which the Company has a 90% interest acquired a property located at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan for $136,550,000. The Company and its partner invested cash of $43,400,000 and $4,800,000, respectively, in the venture to acquire the property. The venture obtained a $95,000,000 mortgage loan which bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.50% (8.04% as of December 31, 2005) and matures in August 2006, with two six month extensions. The property contains 122 rental apartments with an aggregate of 133,000 square feet and 5,700 square feet of commercial space.

The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly issued Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units (valued at $61,814,000) and $27,300,000 of its pro rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the partnership. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On December 27, 2005, the Company acquired the Broadway Mall, located on Route 106 in Hicksville, Long Island, New York, for $152,500,000, consisting of $57,600,000 in cash and $94,900,000 of existing mortgage debt.

The purchase price was approximately $319,000,000, consisting of $170,000,000 in cash and $149,000,000 of existing mortgage and other debt. The operations of the Warner Building are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition. 58 Overview continued On December 28, 2005, the Company acquired the Boston Design Center, which contains 552,500 square feet and is located in South Boston for $96,000,000, consisting of $24,000,000 in cash and $72,000,000 of existing mortgage debt. The operations of the Boston Design Center are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition. On January 31, 2006, the Company closed on an option to purchase the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall which is located on 79 acres at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road in Springfield, Fairfax County, Virginia, and is anchored by Macys, and J.C. Penney and Target, who own their stores aggregating 389,000 square feet. The purchase price for the option was $35,600,000, of which the Company paid $14,000,000 in cash at closing and the remainder of $21,600,000 will be paid in installments over four years. The Company intends to redevelop, reposition and re tenant the mall and has committed to spend $25,000,000 in capital expenditures over a six year period from the closing of the option agreement. The option becomes exercisable upon the passing of one of the existing principals of the selling entity and may be deferred at the Companys election through November 2012. Upon exercise of the option, the Company will pay $80,000,000 to acquire the mall, subject to the existing mortgage of $180,000,000, which will be amortized to $149,000,000 at maturity in 2013. Upon closing of the option on January 31, 2006, the Company acquired effective control of the mall, including management of the mall and right to the malls net cash flow. Accordingly, the Company will consolidate the accounts of the mall into its financial position and results of operations pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R. The Company has a 2.5% minority partner in this transaction. Investment in H Street Building Corporation (H Street) On July 20, 2005, the Company acquired H Street, which owns directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34 acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in Washington, DC containing 577,000 square feet. The purchase price was approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and $52,100,000 for the Companys pro rata share of existing mortgage debt. The operations of H Street are consolidated into the accounts of the Company from the date of acquisition. On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging that the Company encouraged H Street and the affiliated parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of the Companys acquisition of H Street. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under a ground lease with one of these corporations brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the Companys acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer and on that basis seeks a rescission of the Companys acquisition and the right to acquire H Street for the price paid by the Company. On September 12, 2005, the Company filed a complaint against each of these corporations and their acting directors seeking a restoration of H Streets full shareholder rights and damages. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. In connection with these legal actions, the Company has accrued legal fees of $2,134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2005, which are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income. The Company believes that the actions filed against the Company are without merit and that it will ultimately be successful in defending against them. Because of the legal actions described above, the Company has not been granted access to the financial information of these two corporations and accordingly has not recorded its share of their net income or loss or disclosed its pro rata share of their outstanding debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 59 Investment in Toys R Us (Toys) On July 21, 2005, a joint venture owned equally by the Company, Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. acquired Toys for $26.75 per share in cash or approximately $6.6 billion. In connection therewith, the Company invested $428,000,000 of the $1.3 billion of equity in the venture, consisting of $407,000,000 in cash and $21,000,000 in Toys common shares held by the Company. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006. Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000, which consisted of (i) the Companys $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Companys $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Companys senior unsecured bridge loan described below and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees. On August 29, 2005, the Company acquired $150,000,000 of the $1.9 billion one year senior unsecured bridge loan financing provided to Toys. The loan is senior to the acquisition equity of $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of existing debt. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.25% (9.43% as of December 31, 2005) not to exceed 11% and provides for an initial .375% placement fee and additional fees of .375% at the end of three and six months if the loan has not been repaid. The loan is prepayable at any time without penalty. On December 9, 2005, $73,184,000 of this loan was repaid to the Company. On January 9, 2006, Toys announced plans and is in the process of closing 87 Toys R Us stores in the United States, of which twelve stores will be converted into Babies R Us stores, five leased properties are expiring and one has been sold. Vornado is handling the leasing and disposition of the real estate of the remaining 69 stores. As a result of the store closing program, Toys will incur restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $155,000,000 before tax, which includes $45,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Of this amount, approximately $99,000,000 will be recorded in Toys fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $56,000,000 will be recorded in the first quarter of their next fiscal year. These estimated amounts are preliminary and remain subject to change. The Companys 32.95% share of the $155,000,000 charge is $51,000,000, of which $36,000,000 will have no income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating the inventory of approximately $9,000,000 after tax, will be recorded as an expense in the first quarter of 2006. The unaudited pro forma information set forth below presents the condensed consolidated statements of income for the Company for the three months and years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (including Toys results for the three and twelve months ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively) as if the above transactions had occurred on November 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what the Companys actual results would have been had the Toys transactions been consummated on November 1, 2003, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods. In managements opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect these transactions have been made.

(Sears) In July and August 2004, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,176,600 common shares of Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears) for $41,945,000, an average price of $35.65 per share. On March 30, 2005, upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart, the Company received 370,330 common shares of Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq: SHLD) (Sears Holdings) and $21,797,000 of cash in exchange for its 1,176,600 Sears common shares. The Sears Holdings common shares were valued at $48,143,000, based on the March 30, 2005 closing share price of $130.00. As a result the Company recognized a net gain of $27,651,000, the difference between the aggregate cost basis in the Sears shares and the market value of the total consideration received of $69,940,000. On April 4, 2005, 99,393 of the Companys Sears Holdings common shares with a value of $13,975,000 were utilized to satisfy a third party participation. The remaining 270,937 Sears Holdings shares were sold in the fourth quarter of 2005 at a weighted average sales price of $125.83 per share, which resulted in a net loss on disposition of $1,137,000, based on the March 30, 2005 adjusted cost basis of $130.00 per share. The Companys net gain on its investment in these Sears shares was $26,514,000. In August and September 2004, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000, expire in April 2006 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, the Companys derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30, 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, 402,660 of the common shares were sold at a weighted average sales price of $123.77 per share. In accordance with the derivative agreements, the proceeds from these sales will remain in the derivative position until the entire position is settled or until expiration in April 2006. Based on Sears Holdings closing share price on December 31, 2005 of $115.53, the remaining shares in the derivative position have a market value of $241,361,000, which together with cash of $196,499,000 aggregates $437,860,000. In the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark to market of the remaining shares in the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December 31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. The Companys aggregate net income recognized on the owned shares and the derivative position from inception to December 31, 2005 was $124,266,000. Investment in Sears Canada Inc. (Sears Canada) In connection with the Companys investment in Sears Holdings Corporation, the Company acquired 7,500,000 common shares of Sears Canada between February and September of 2005 for an aggregate cost of $143,737,000, or $19.16 per share. On December 16, 2005, Sears Canada paid a special dividend, of which Vornados share was $120,500,000. As a result, the Company recognized $22,885,000 of income in the fourth quarter of 2005 (in addition to the unrecognized gain of $53,870,000 discussed below) and paid a $.77 special cash dividend on December 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on December 27, 2005. The Company accounts for its investment in Sears Canada as a marketable equity security classified as available for sale. Accordingly, the common shares are marked to market on a quarterly basis through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2005, based on a closing share price of $15.47, the unrecognized gain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income is $53,870,000. 61 Overview continued Investment in McDonalds Corporation (McDonalds) (NYSE: MCD) In July 2005, the Company acquired an aggregate of 858,000 common shares of McDonalds for $25,346,000, an average price of $29.54 per share. These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and are classified as available for sale. Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the Companys consolidated balance sheet and not recognized in income. At December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds closing stock price of $33.72 per share, $3,585,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares was included in accumulated other comprehensive income. During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds common shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the mark to market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge. Based on McDonalds most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Companys aggregate investment in McDonalds represents 1.2% of McDonalds outstanding common shares. Other 2005 Acquisitions In addition to the acquisitions and investments described above, the Company made $281,500,000 of other acquisitions and investments during 2005, which are summarized below: (Amounts in thousands) Amount Segment Dune Capital L.P.

On October 1, 2005, Dune Capital made a return of capital to one of its investors and the Companys ownership interest was effectively increased to 5.4%. The Company initially accounted for this investment on the cost method based on its ownership interest on May 31, 2005. Subsequent to October 1, 2005, the Company accounts for its investment on the equity method on a one quarter lag basis. Dune Capitals financial statements are prepared on a market value basis and changes in value from one reporting period to the next are recognized in income.

Americold owned 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics. On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company (CEI) collectively sold 20.7% of Americolds common shares to The Yucaipa Companies (Yucaipa) for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Companys share was $18,789,000.

Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa. Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be entitled to receive up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold, realized through the sale of a portion of the Companys and CEIs interests in Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americolds Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027. CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%. In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved. The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americolds Board of Trustees.

In connection with this commitment, the Company received a placement fee of $3,200,000. The Company also purchased for $1,000,000, warrants to acquire GMH common equity. The warrants entitled the Company to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit, through May 6, 2006 and are adjusted for dividends declared by GCT. The Company funded a total of $113,777,000 of the commitment as of November 3, 2004. On November 3, 2004, GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (GCT) closed its initial public offering (IPO) at a price of $12.00 per share. GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general partner. In connection with the IPO, (i) the $113,777,000 previously funded by the Company under the $159,000,000 commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000, (ii) the Company contributed its 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which it acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited partnership units and (iii) the Company exercised its first tranche of warrants to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or an aggregate of $50,000,000, which resulted in a gain of $29,500,000. As of December 31, 2005, the Company owns 7,337,857 GMH partnership units (which are exchangeable on a one for one basis into common shares of GCT) and 700,000 common shares of GCT, which were acquired from GCT in October 2005 for $14.25 per share, and holds warrants to purchase 5,884,727 GMH limited partnership units or GCT common shares at a price of $8.50 per unit or share. The Companys aggregate investment represents 11.3% of the limited partnership interest in GMH. The Company accounts for its investment in the GMH partnership units and GCT common shares on the equity method based on its percentage ownership interest and because Michael D. Fascitelli, the Companys President, is a member of the Board of Trustees of GCT, effective August 10, 2005. The Company records its pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis as the Company files its financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time GMH files its financial statements. The Company accounts for the warrants as derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statements of income. In the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized income of $14,079,000 and $24,190,000, respectively, from the mark to market of these warrants which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCTs closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 and $14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For Mr. Fascitellis service as a Director, on August 10, 2005 he received 4,034 restricted common shares of GCT at a price of $14.33 per share.

The original plan assumed that this building would remain an office building to be re leased in Q1 06. Of the square feet leased to larger tenants, 261,000 square feet was leased to the Federal Supply Service (which will relocate from 240,000 square feet in other Crystal City buildings); 144,000 square feet was leased to KBR, a defense contractor; and 126,000 square feet was leased to the Public Broadcasting Service. Straight line rent per square foot for the square feet leased is $33.50, which is equal to the estimate in the original plan. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot are $43.50 as compared to the original plan of $45.28. 69 Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Companys accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $9.8 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If the Company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon acquisitions of real estate, the Company assesses the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and allocates purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The Companys properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Identified Intangible Assets Upon an acquisition of a business the Company records intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. The Company amortizes identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $197,014,000 and $176,122,000, respectively. Such amounts are included in other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company had $146,325,000 and $70,264,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, which are included in deferred credit on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. If these assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements could be material. 70 Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable The Companys policy is to record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable were $363,565,000 and $440,186,000, respectively. The Company accretes or amortizes any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether it is impaired. A loan is considered to be impaired, when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The impact of the Companys estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of its loans could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1,369,853,000 and $605,300,000, respectively. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, it considers factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which it will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. The Company accounts for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and the Company has significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Companys share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. The Companys investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of the Companys investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. The Company will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts ($16,907,000 and $17,339,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. The Company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($6,051,000 and $6,787,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 71 Revenue Recognition The Company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rents income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. Percentage Rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenues income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Show Revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue income arising from the Companys investment in Americold Logistics. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Before the Company recognizes revenue, it assesses, among other things, its collectibility. If the Companys assessment of the collectibility of its revenue changes, the impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders 100% of its taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If the Company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result. 72 Recently Issued Accounting Literature On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 on its effective date did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123: (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2005. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123R on a modified prospective method, effective January 1, 2006 and believes that the adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 provides clarification of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS 143, defined as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company. Under this standard, a company must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 became effective in the Companys fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005. Certain of the Companys real estate assets contain asbestos. Although the asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, the Companys practice is to remediate the asbestos upon the renovation or redevelopment of its properties. Accordingly, the Company has determined that these assets meet the criteria for recording a liability and has recorded an asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $8,400,000, which is included in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was approximately $2,500,000, and is included in Depreciation and Amortization on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior periods financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue No. 04 05, Determining Whether a General Partner, or General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 05). EITF 04 05 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls, and should consolidate, a limited partnership or a similar entity. EITF 04 05 became effective on June 29, 2005, for all newly formed or modified limited partnership arrangements and January 1, 2006 for all existing limited partnership arrangements. The Company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 73 Net income and EBITDA by Segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Excluding these items, the percentages of EBITDA by segment are 69.8% for Office, 16.3% for Retail, 14.5% for Merchandise Mart, 8.9% for Temperature Controlled Logistics and (9.5)% for Other. See Notes on the following page. 76 Notes to the preceding tabular information: (1) Interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization included in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA includes the Companys share of the interest and debt expense and depreciation and amortization of its partially owned entities. (2) At December 31, 2004, 7 West 34th Street, a 440,000 square foot New York office building, was 100% occupied by four tenants, of which Health Insurance Plan of New York (HIP) and Fairchild Publications occupied 255,000 and 146,000 square feet, respectively. Effective January 4, 2005, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with HIP under which HIP made an initial payment of $13,362 and is anticipated to make annual payments ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 over the remaining six years of the HIP lease contingent upon the level of operating expenses of the building in each year. In connection with the termination of the HIP lease, the Company wrote off the $2,462 balance of the HIP receivable arising from the straight lining of rent. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company began redevelopment of a portion of this property into a permanent showroom building for the giftware industry. As of January 1, 2005, the Company transferred the operations and financial results related to the office component of this asset from the New York City Office division to the Merchandise Mart division for both the current and prior periods presented. The operations and financial results related to the retail component of this asset were transferred to the Retail division for both current and prior periods presented.

The increase is primarily due to (i) $30,895,000 for the Companys share of Alexanders after tax net gain on sale of condominiums in the current year, (ii) a $16,236,000 decrease in the Companys share of Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation (SAR) expense, (iii) income from Alexanders 731 Lexington Avenue property which was placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2004, (iv) a $2,465,000 increase in development and guarantee fees, (v) a $1,399,000 increase in management and leasing fees, partially offset by, (vi) a $2,520,000 decrease in interest income on the Companys loans to Alexanders which were repaid in July 2005 and (vii) $1,274,000 for the Companys share of a gain on sale of land parcel in the prior year. Loss Applicable to Toys R Us The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006. Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which consisted of (i) the Companys $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) the Companys $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Companys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees. 81 Income from Partially Owned Entities Below are the condensed statements of operations of the Companys unconsolidated investments, as well as the increase (decrease) in income from these partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: (Amounts in thousands) Total Monmouth Mall Newkirk MLP GMH (1) Beverly Connection (2) Starwood Ceruzzi Joint Venture (3) Partially Owned Office Buildings Temperature Controlled Logistics (4) Other December 31, 2005: Revenues $ 24,804 $ 233,430 $ 195,340 $ 5,813 $ 1,312 $ 155,014 Expenses: Operating, general and administrative and costs of good sold (10,126 ) (13,882 ) (131,796 ) (3,724 ) (2,020 ) (59,235 ) Depreciation (4,648 ) (45,974 ) (26,453 ) (3,436 ) (470 ) (24,532 ) Interest expense (8,843 ) (66,152 ) (24,448 ) (6,088 ) (41,554 ) Other, net (6,574 ) (58,640 ) (2,145 ) (8 ) (274 ) Net (loss) income $ (5,387 ) $ 48,782 $ 12,643 $ (9,580 ) $ (1,186 ) $ 29,419 Companys interest 50 % 15.82 % 12.08 % 50 % 80 % 12.8 % Equity in net (loss) income $ 9,077 $ (2,694 ) $ 10,196 1,528 $ (4,790 ) $ (949 ) $ 3,771 $ 2,015 Interest and other income 24,766 6,875 9,154 7,403 (132 ) 1,466 Fee income 2,322 1,065 900 357 Income (loss) from partially owned entities $ 36,165 $ 5,246 (5) $ 19,350 (6) $ 1,528 $ 3,513 $ (949 ) $ 3,639 N/A $ 3,838 (8) December 31, 2004: Revenues $ 24,936 $ 239,496 $ 1,649 $ 118,660 $ 131,053 Expenses: Operating, general and administrative and costs of good sold (9,915 ) (23,495 ) (3,207 ) (48,329 ) (29,351 ) Depreciation (6,573 ) (45,134 ) (634 ) (19,167 ) (50,211 ) Interest expense (6,390 ) (80,174 ) (32,659 ) (45,504 ) Other, net (3,208 ) 45,344 (4,791 ) 975 (5,387 ) Net (loss) income $ (1,150 ) $ 136,037 $ (6,983 ) $ 19,480 $ 600 Companys interest 50 % 22.4 % 80 % 17 % 47.6 % Equity in net income (loss) $ 22,860 $ (576 ) $ 24,041 $ (5,586 ) $ 2,935 $ 360 $ 1,686 Interest and other income 14,459 3,290 11,396 (207 ) (20 ) Fee income 6,062 1,027 5,035 Income (loss) from partially owned entities $ 43,381 $ 3,741 $ 35,437 (6) $ N/A $ N/A $ (5,586 )(7) $ 2,728 $ 5,375 $ 1,686 (8) (Decrease) increase in income of partially owned entities $ (7,216 ) $ 1,505 (5) $ (16,087 )(6) $ 1,528 $ 3,513 $ 4,637 (7) $ 911 $ (5,375 ) $ 2,152 (8) See footnotes on following page. 82 Notes to preceding tabular information: (1) See page 66 for details.

(7) 2004 includes the Companys $3,833 share of Starwood Ceruzzis impairment loss. (8) 2005 includes $1,351 of income recognized from Dune Capital L.P. 83 Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $167,225,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $203,998,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $36,773,000. This decrease resulted from the following: (Amounts in thousands) Increase (decrease) due to: Income of $81,730 from the mark to market of Sears derivative position in 2004, partially offset by income of $14,968 in 2005 from the net gain on conversion of Sears derivative position to Sears Holdings derivative position on March 30, 2005 and mark to market adjustments though 2005 $ (66,762 ) Net gain on exercise of GMH warrants in 2004 (29,452 ) Net gain on conversion of Sears common shares to Sears Holdings common shares and sale in 2005 26,514 Income recognized as a result of Sears Canada special dividend in 2005 22,885 Income from the mark to market of McDonalds derivative position in 2005 17,254 Interest on $159,000 commitment to GMH in 2004, which was satisfied in November 2004 (16,581 ) Income of $24,190 from the mark to market of GMH warrants in 2004, partially offset by income of $14,080 from the mark to market of the warrants in through 2005 (10,110 ) Other, net primarily due to higher yields on higher average amounts invested 19,479 $ (36,773 ) Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $340,751,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $242,955,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $97,796,000. This increase is primarily due to (i) $49,893,000 resulting from the consolidation of the Companys investment in Americold from November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method previously, (ii) $26,199,000 from a 2.27% increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt, (iii) $15,335,000 of interest expense on the $500,000,000 exchangeable senior debentures issued in March 2005 and (iv) $6,881,000 of additional interest expense on the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2009, which were issued in August 2004. Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly owned and Partially owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates to the disposition of the Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for the net gain on disposition of the Companys senior preferred equity investment in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on sale of land parcels.

Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities Minority interest expense of partially owned entities was $3,808,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $109,000 in the prior year, an increase of $3,699,000. This increase resulted primarily from the consolidation of the Companys investment in Americold beginning on November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method in the prior year. 84 Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation. The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

All of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax free like kind exchange investments pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential Complex, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest in the Palisades venture it did not previously own for approximately $17,000,000 in cash. On June 29, 2004, the Company sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000. On August 12, 2004, the Company sold its Dundalk, Maryland shopping center for $12,900,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $9,850,000. Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $67,119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $69,108,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $1,989,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of (i) $80,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 3 preferred units in January 2005, (ii) $245,000,000 of the remaining 8.25% Series D 3 and D 4 preferred units in July 2005, (iii) $342,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 5 and D 7 preferred units in September 2005 and (iv) $30,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 6 and D 8 preferred units in December 2005, partially offset by, (v) a $19,017,000 write off of the issuance costs of the preferred units redeemed in 2005, and (vi) distributions to holders of the 7.20% Series D 11 and 6.55% Series D 12 units issued in May and December 2004. Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $66,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $88,091,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $21,336,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A operating partnership units into common shares of the Company during 2004 and 2005, and lower net income subject to allocation to the minority limited partners. 85 EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA. (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Toys Other Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 1,204,850 $ 634,889 $ 177,826 $ 134,930 $ 71,514 $ $ 185,691 2005 Operations: Same store operations(1) 290 4,977 5,788 Acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses (2,801 ) 29,897 8,374 4,252 14,860 (5) Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 1,301,628 $ 632,378 $ 212,700 $ 149,092 $ 75,766 $ 14,860 $ 216,832 % increase in same store operations %(2) 3.2 % 4.7% (3) N/A (4) N/A (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses above. (2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase (decrease) were $341,601 and 4.3% for the New York City Office portfolio and $290,777 and (4.7%) for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio. (3) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of the WPP Group leases (228 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times lease (127 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004. The same store percentage increase in EBITDA exclusive of these leases was 0.9%. (4) Not comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (date the operations of AmeriCold Logistics were combined with Americold Realty Trust), the Company reflected its equity in the rent Americold received from AmeriCold Logistics. Subsequent thereto, the Company consolidates the operations of the combined company. See page 101 for condensed pro forma operating results of Americold for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, giving effect to the acquisition of its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2004. The same store percentage increase on a pro forma basis for the combined company is 14.2%. (5) The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, the Company records its 32.95% share of Toys net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the Company will record its share of Toys fourth quarter net income in its first quarter of 2006. Toys EBITDA above includes (i) the Companys share of Toys EBITDA for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through October 29, 2005, (ii) $5,043,000 of interest income on the Companys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250,000 of management fees. 86 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 Revenues The Companys revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements, hotel revenues, trade shows revenues, amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases pursuant to SFAS No. 141 and 142, and fee income, were $1,712,713,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $1,502,850,000 in the prior year, an increase of $209,863,000.

Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $88,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $105,132,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $17,041,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A operating partnership units into common shares of the Company during 2003 and 2004, partially offset by higher net income subject to allocation to the minority limited partners. 93 Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation.

to EBITDA reflects amounts which are netted in income from partially owned entities. (2) In the first quarter of 2005, the Company began redevelopment of a portion of 7 West 34th Street into a permanent showroom building for the giftware industry. As of January 1, 2005, the Company transferred the operations and financial results related to the office component of this asset from the New York City Office division to the Merchandise Mart division for both the current and prior periods presented. The operations and financial results related to the retail component of this asset were transferred to the Retail division for both current and prior periods presented. (3) Operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, reflect the consolidation of the Companys investment in Americold beginning on November 18, 2004. Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method. (4) Equity in net loss from Toys for the three months ended December 31, 2005 represents (i) $44,812,000 for the Companys share of Toys net loss for Toys third quarter ended October 29, partially offset by (ii) $3,710,000 of interest income for the Companys share of Toys bridge loan and (iii) $1,136,000 of management fees.

(2) EBITDA and same store percentage increase (decrease) was $90,468 and 5.0% for the New York City Office portfolio and $73,389 and (1.2%) for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio. (3) Not comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (date the operations of AmeriCold Logistics were combined with Americold), the Company reflected its equity in the rent Americold received from AmeriCold Logistics. Subsequent thereto, the Company reflects its equity in the operations of the combined company. 99 The Companys revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter by quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which the Company records on a one quarter lag basis in its first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday seasons impact on the food industry. Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2005: (Amounts in thousands) Total Office Retail Merchandise Mart Temperature Controlled Logistics Toys Other For the three months ended September 30, 2005 $ 227,592 $ 150,944 $ 56,791 $ 33,042 $ 19,248 $ 6,389 $ (38,822 ) 2005 Operations: Same store operations(1) 10,734 649 2,641 2,828 Acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses 2,179 (2,046 ) (1,838 ) 2,082 For the three months ended December 31, 2005 $ 360,488 $ 163,857 $ 55,394 $ 33,845 $ 22,076 $ 8,471 $ 76,845 % increase in same store operations 7.2 %(2) 1.3 % 8.7 %(3) 14.7 % N/A (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses above. (2) EBITDA and same store percentage increase was $90,468 and 7.8% for the New York City Office portfolio and $73,389 and 6.5% for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio. The same store percentage changes reflect seasonally lower utility costs in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, of which $4,584 relates to the New York City Office portfolio and $2,871 relates to the Washington D.C. Office portfolio. The same store operations exclusive of the seasonal change in utilities increased by 2.1% for the New York City Office portfolio and increased by 2.3% for the Washington, D.C. Office portfolio. (3) Primarily due to seasonality of trade show operations. Below is a reconciliation of net income and EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2005.

Americold owned 88 temperature controlled warehouses, all of which were leased to AmeriCold Logistics. On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. On November 18, 2004, the Company and its 40% partner, Crescent Real Estate Equities Company (CEI) collectively sold 20.7% of Americolds common shares to The Yucaipa Companies (Yucaipa) for $145,000,000, which resulted in a gain, of which the Companys share was $18,789,000. The sale price was based on a $1.450 billion valuation for Americold before debt and other obligations. Yucaipa is a private equity firm with significant expertise in the food distribution, logistics and retail industries. Upon closing of the sale to Yucaipa on November 18, 2004, Americold is owned 47.6% by the Company, 31.7% by CEI and 20.7% by Yucaipa. Pursuant to the sales agreement: (i) Yucaipa may be entitled to receive up to 20% of the increase in the value of Americold, realized through the sale of a portion of the Companys and CEIs interests in Americold subject to limitations, provided that Americolds Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 at December 31, 2007; (ii) the annual asset management fee payable by CEI to the Company has been reduced from approximately $5,500,000 to $4,548,000, payable quarterly through October 30, 2027. CEI, at its option, may terminate the payment of this fee at any time after November 2009, by paying the Company a termination fee equal to the present value of the remaining payments through October 30, 2027, discounted at 10%. In addition, CEI is obligated to pay a pro rata portion of the termination fee to the extent it sells a portion of its equity interest in Americold; and (iii) VCPP was dissolved. The Company has the right to appoint three of the five members to Americolds Board of Trustees. Consequently, the Company is deemed to exercise control over Americold and, on November 18, 2004, the Company began to consolidate the operations and financial position of Americold into its accounts and no longer accounts for its investment on the equity method. The following is a pro forma presentation of the results of operations of Americold for the three months and year ended December 31, 2004, giving effect to the acquisition of AmeriCold Logistics as if it had occurred on January 1, 2004 as compared to the actual results for the comparable periods in the current year.

Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis. Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan. Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding. On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23, 2011. At December 31, 2005, the balance of the loan due from Michael Fascitelli, the Companys President, in accordance with his employment agreement was $8,600,000. The loan matures in December 2006 and bears interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average rate of 3.97% (based on the applicable Federal rate). Effective January 1, 2002, the Company extended its employment agreement with Mr. Fascitelli for a five year period through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to the extended employment agreement, Mr. Fascitelli is entitled to receive a deferred payment on December 31, 2006 of 626,566 Vornado common shares which are valued for compensation purposes at $27,500,000 (the value of the shares on March 8, 2002, the date the extended employment agreement was executed). The shares are held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of Mr. Fascitelli and vested 100% on December 31, 2002. The extended employment agreement does not permit diversification, allows settlement of the deferred compensation obligation by delivery of these shares only, and permits the deferred delivery of these shares. The value of these shares was amortized ratably over the one year vesting period as compensation expense. Pursuant to the Companys annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, bearing interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and due in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. On February 22, 2005, the Company and Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President Retail Division, entered into a new employment agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of the Companys stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of the Companys common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price. In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan the Company provided him under his prior employment agreement. On March 11, 2004, the Company loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer of the Company, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement. Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15, 2005. In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan as of June 30, 2005 was repaid on August 14, 2005. Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees of the Company Alexanders The Company owns 33% of Alexanders. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli are officers and directors of Alexanders, the Company provides various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to the Companys consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, the Companys President and President of Alexanders, exercised 350,000 of his Alexanders stock appreciation rights (SARs) which were scheduled to expire in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference between Alexanders stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88. This exercise was consistent with Alexanders tax planning. On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexanders granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexanders common stock. The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexanders common stock on date of grant. The SAR will become exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexanders on such date, and will expire on March 14, 2007. Mr. Fascitellis early exercise and Alexanders related tax consequences were factors in Alexanders decision to make the new grant to him. 102 Interstate Properties As of December 31, 2005, Interstate Properties and its partners beneficially owned approximately 9.2% of the common shares of beneficial interest of the Company and 27.7% of Alexanders common stock. Interstate Properties is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. are the partners. Mr. Roth is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Alexanders. Messrs. Mandelbaum and Wight are trustees of the Company and also directors of Alexanders. The Company manages and leases the real estate assets of Interstate Properties pursuant to a management agreement for which the Company receives an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. The Company believes based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that its terms are fair to the Company. The Company earned $791,000, $726,000 and $703,000 of management fees under the management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In addition, during fiscal year 2003, as a result of a previously existing leasing arrangement with Alexanders, Alexanders paid to Interstate $587,000, for the leasing and other services actually rendered by the Company. Upon receipt of these payments, Interstate promptly paid them over to the Company without retaining any interest therein. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2003 and all payments by Alexanders thereafter for these leasing and other services are made directly to the Company. Vornado Operating Company (Vornado Operating) In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from the Company in order to own assets that the Company could not itself own and conduct activities that the Company could not itself conduct. Vornado Operatings primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from Americold, owned 60% by the Company. On November 4, 2004, Americold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of its loan to the Company as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest. Because the Company fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, it recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in the fourth quarter 2004. In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating, its directors and the Company. The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to Americold (owned 60% by the Company) and damages. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties. On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which the Company agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. The Company accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2004. On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement. 103 Other On January 1, 2003, the Company acquired BMS, a company which provides cleaning and related services principally to the Companys Manhattan office properties, for $13,000,000 in cash from the estate of Bernard Mendik and certain other individuals including David R. Greenbaum, an executive officer of the Company. The Company paid BMS $53,024,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002, for services rendered to the Companys Manhattan office properties. Although the terms and conditions of the contracts pursuant to which these services were provided were not negotiated at arms length, the Company believes based upon comparable amounts charged to other real estate companies that the terms and conditions of the contracts were fair to the Company. On August 4, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of 2101 L Street, a 370,000 square foot office building located in Washington D.C. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately 1.1 million newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at approximately $49,517,000) and the assumption of existing mortgage debt and transaction costs totaling approximately $32,000,000. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, together with family members, owned approximately 24 percent of the limited partnership that sold the building and Mr. Smith was a general partner. On August 5, 2003, the Company repaid the mortgage of $29,056,000. On October 7, 2003, the Company acquired a 2.5% interest in the planned redevelopment of Waterfront (described in Note 3) for $2,171,000, of which the Company paid $1,545,000 in cash and issued 12,500 Operating Partnership units valued at $626,000. The partnership units were issued to Mitchell N. Schear, one of the partners in the Waterfront interest, and the President of the Companys CESCR division. On July 1, 2004, the Company acquired the Marriott hotel located in its Crystal City office complex from a limited partnership in which Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of the Company, together with family members, own approximately 67 percent. The purchase price of $21,500,000 was paid in cash. The hotel contains 343 rooms and is leased to an affiliate of Marriott International, Inc. until July 31, 2015, with one 10 year extension option. The land under the hotel was acquired in 1999. On October 1, 2004, the Company increased its ownership interest in the Investment Building in Washington, D.C. to 5% by acquiring an additional 2.8% interest for $2,240,000 in cash. The Companys original interest in the property was acquired in connection with the acquisition of the Kaempfer Company in April 2003. Mitchell N. Schear, President of the Companys Washington, D.C. Office division and other former members of Kaempfer management were also partners in the Investment Building partnership. On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired a 46% partnership interest in, and became co general partner of, partnerships that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195 rental units. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly issued Vornado Realty L.P. partnership units (valued at $61,814,000) and $27,300,000 of its pro rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the partnership. 104 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company anticipates that cash from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund its business operations, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and recurring capital expenditures, and together with existing cash balances, will be greater than its anticipated cash requirements, including development and redevelopment expenditures and debt amortization. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions may require funding from borrowings or equity offerings. The Companys believes that it has complied with the financial covenants required by its revolving credit facility and its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2025, and that as of December 31, 2005, it has the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. As at December 31, 2005, the Company has an effective shelf registration under which the Company can offer an aggregate of approximately $836,750,000 of equity securities and Vornado Realty L.P. can offer an aggregate of $4,510,000,000 of debt securities. Certain Future Cash Requirements For 2006 the Company has budgeted approximately $173,500,000 for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows: (Amounts in millions except square foot data) Total New York City Office Washington DC Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other (1) Expenditures to maintain assets $ 70.0 $ 18.0 $ 17.0 $ 2.0 $ 13.0 $ 20.0 Tenant improvements 76.0 16.0 40.5 4.6 14.9 Leasing commissions 27.5 6.0 14.5 2.4 4.6 Total Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions 103.5 22.0 55.0 7.0 19.5 Per square foot $ 35.00 $ 16.20 $ 15.40 $ 15.00 (2) $ Per square foot per annum $ 3.60 $ 2.70 $ 1.40 $ 3.00 (2) $ Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions $ 173.5 $ 40.0 $ 72.0 $ 9.0 $ 32.5 $ 20.0 Square feet budgeted to be leased (in thousands) 650 2,650 450 1,300 Weighted average lease term 9.5 6.0 11.0 5.0 (1) Americold, Hotel Pennsylvania, Paramus Office and Warehouses. (2) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2006 leasing activity are $33.75 ($5.80 per annum) and $10.00 ($1.90 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively. In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, the Company is currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which it has budgeted approximately $718,500,000. Of this amount, $228,000,000 is estimated to be expended in 2006. The table above excludes the anticipated 2006 capital expenditures of Alexanders, Newkirk MLP, Toys R Us or any other partially owned entity that is not consolidated by the Company, as these entities are expected to fund their own cash requirements without additional equity contributions from the Company. 105 Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations Below is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005. (Amounts in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Contractual Cash Obligations: Mortgages and Notes Payable (principal and interest) $ 6,703,189 $ 669,796 $ 1,563,391 $ 1,614,495 $ 2,855,507 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 539,750 26,500 513,250 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 288,438 11,250 22,500 254,688 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 244,333 9,500 19,000 215,833 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2025 872,969 19,375 38,750 38,750 776,094 Americold Revolving Credit Facility 9,151 9,151 Operating leases 1,066,912 26,913 50,339 45,880 943,780 Purchase obligations, primarily construction commitments 26,658 26,658 Capital lease obligations 64,225 10,004 15,308 12,412 26,501 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 9,815,625 $ 809,147 $ 2,222,538 $ 2,182,058 $ 4,601,882 Commitments: Capital commitments to partially owned entities $ 40,800 $ 20,800 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ Standby letters of credit 40,962 40,962 Mezzanine loan commitments 30,530 30,530 Other Guarantees Total Commitments $ 112,292 $ 92,292 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ At December 31, 2005, the Companys $600,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2006, had a zero outstanding balance and $22,311,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility contains financial covenants, which require the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the Companys ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2005, Americolds $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a $9,076,000 outstanding balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility requires Americold to maintain, on a trailing four quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Both of these facilities contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. On March 29, 2005, the Company completed a public offering of $500,000,000 principal amount of 3.875% exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 pursuant to an effective registration statement. The notes were sold at 98.0% of their principal amount. The net proceeds from this offering, after the underwriters discount were approximately $490,000,000. The debentures are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, for common shares of the Company at a current exchange rate of 11.062199 (initial exchange rate of 10.9589) common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The Company may elect to settle any exchange right in cash. The debentures permit the Company to increase its common dividend 5% per annum, cumulatively, without an increase to the exchange rate. The debentures are redeemable at the Companys option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require the issuer to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2015 and 2020 and in the event of a change in control. The Company has made acquisitions and investments in partially owned entities for which it is committed to fund additional capital aggregating $40,800,000. Of this amount, $25,000,000 relates to capital expenditures to be funded over the next six years at the Springfield Mall, in which it has a 97.5% interest. In addition to the above, on November 10, 2005, the Company committed to fund up to $30,530,000 of the junior portion of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. The Company will earn current pay interest at 30 day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one year extension option. The Company anticipates funding all or portions of the loan beginning in 2006. 106 The Company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to its assets. Below is a summary of the current all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect through September 2006 for each of the following business segments: Coverage Per Occurrence All Risk (1) Sub Limits for Acts of Terrorism New York City Office $ 1,400,000,000 $ 750,000,000 Washington, D.C. Office 1,400,000,000 750,000,000 Retail 500,000,000 500,000,000 Merchandise Mart 1,400,000,000 750,000,000 Temperature Controlled Logistics 225,000,000 225,000,000 (1) Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub limit shown in the adjacent column. In addition to the coverage above, the Company carries lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. The Companys debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties (which are generally non recourse to the Company), its senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010, its exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 and its revolving credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring the Company to maintain insurance. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, the Company may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than the Company is able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to finance and or refinance its properties and expand its portfolio. Each of the Companys properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to the Company. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC NJ) claiming the Company has no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. On May 17, 2005, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed the Companys motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. The Company intends to pursue its claims against Stop & Shop vigorously. There are various other legal actions against the Company in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. The Company enters into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in the name of the Company by various money center banks. The Company has the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon. The Company had $177,650,000 and $23,110,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. From time to time, the Company has disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, it remains contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that cannot be quantified by the Company. 107 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Cash and cash equivalents were $294,504,000 at December 31, 2005, as compared to $599,282,000 at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $304,778,000.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the Companys Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 16 Income per Share, in the Companys notes to consolidated financial statements on page 173 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $757,219,000, or $5.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $750,043,000, or $5.63 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $194,101,000 or $1.26 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2005, compared to $299,441,000, or $2.22 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2004.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the control of the Company. Various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Companys cash flows and earnings. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has an interest rate swap as described in footnote 1 to the table below. Management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The Companys exposure to a change in interest rates on its consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1% Change In Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Consolidated debt: Variable rate (1) $ 1,150,333 5.98 % $ 11,503 $ 1,114,981 3.45 % Fixed rate 5,104,550 6.06 % 3,841,529 6.68 % $ 6,254,883 6.04 % 11,503 $ 4,956,510 5.95 % Pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities(non recourse to the Company): Variable rate before Toys R Us $ 199,273 5.64 % 1,993 $ 122,007 4.67 % Variable rate of Toys R Us 1,623,447 7.02 % 16,234 % Fixed rate (including $557,844 of Toys debt in 2005) 1,179,626 7.23 % 547,935 6.73 % $ 3,002,346 7.01 % 18,227 $ 669,942 6.36 % Minority limited partners share of above (2,859 ) Total pro forma change in the Companys annual net income $ 26,871 Per share diluted $ 0.17 (1) Includes $499,445 and $512,791, respectively, for the Companys senior unsecured notes due 2007, as the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus .7725%, based upon the trailing 3 month LIBOR rate (4.53% at December 31, 2005). In accordance with SFAS No. 133: Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, accounting for these swaps requires the Company to fair value the debt at each reporting period. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value adjustment was ($341) and $13,148, and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above. The fair value of the Companys debt, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt, exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately $50,058,000 at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has mezzanine loans receivable of $209,248,000 on which the Company receives interest based on a variable rate (a fixed spread plus 30, 60 or 90 day LIBOR). The Company believes that a portion of its exposure to a change in interest rates on its floating rate debt, as illustrated above, is partially mitigated by the outstanding amounts of these loans receivable. 115 Derivative Instruments The Company has the following derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment: Upon consummation of the merger between Sears and Kmart on March 30, 2005, the Companys derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holding valued at $323,936,000 based on the $130.00 per share closing price on March 30, 2005, the date of the merger, and $146,663,000 of cash. As a result, the Company recognized a net gain of approximately $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the Companys derivative position after the exchange of these underlying assets. Because this derivative position does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. For the period from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the Company recorded an expense of $43,475,000 from the derivative position, which consists of (i) $30,230,000 from the mark to market of the remaining shares in the derivative based on Sears Holdings $115.53 closing share price on December 31, 2005, (ii) $2,509,000 for the net loss on the shares sold based on a weighted average sales price of $123.77 and (iii) $10,736,000 resulting primarily from the increase in the strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. During the three months ended September 30, 2005, the Company acquired an economic interest in 14,565,000 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which the Company purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds common shares. These call and put options have an initial weighted average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement. Under the agreement, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide the Company with the same economic gain or loss as if it had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded net income of $17,254,000, comprised of (i) $15,239,000 from the mark to market of the options on December 31, 2005, based on McDonalds closing stock price of $33.72 per share, (ii) $9,759,000 of dividend income, partially offset by (iii) $7,744,000 for the increase in strike price resulting from the LIBOR charge. Under a warrant agreement with GMH Communities L.P., the Company holds 5.9 million warrants to purchase partnership units of GMH or GCT common shares at an adjusted exercise price of $8.50 per unit or share. Because these warrants are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on the Companys consolidated statement of income. In the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $14,079,000 of income from the mark to market of these warrants based on GCTs closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 per share on December 31, 2005. 116
