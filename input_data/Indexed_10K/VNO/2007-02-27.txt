In addition, we have a 47.6% interest in AmeriCold Realty Trust (AmeriCold), which owns and operates 91 cold storage warehouses nationwide and a 32.9% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, as well as other real estate and related investments. Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value. We measure our success in meeting this objective by the total return to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) for the following periods ending December 31, 2006: Total Return (1) Vornado RMS One year 50.1% 35.9% Three years 149.1% 100.4% Five years 270.0% 184.0% Ten years 656.3% 282.2% (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future. We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; Investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; Developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and Providing specialty financing to real estate related companies. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. Economic growth has been fostered, in part, by low interest rates, Federal tax cuts, and increases in government spending. To the extent economic growth stalls, we may experience lower occupancy rates which may lead to lower initial rental rates, higher leasing costs and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. Alternatively, if economic growth is sustained, we may experience higher occupancy rates leading to higher initial rents and higher interest rates causing an increase in our weighted average cost of capital and a corresponding effect on net income, funds from operations and cash flow. Our net income and funds from operations will also be affected by the seasonality of the Toys business and competition from discount and mass merchandisers. 59 Overview continued Year Ended December 31, 2006 Financial Results Summary Net income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $502,629,000, or $3.35 per diluted share, versus $493,103,000, or $3.50 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005.

These shares are recorded as marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as available for sale. Appreciation or depreciation in the fair market value of these shares is recorded as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets and not recognized in income. At December 31, 2006, based on McDonalds closing stock price of $44.33 per share, $12,688,000 of appreciation in the value of these shares is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet. During the second half of 2005, we acquired an economic interest in an additional 14,565,500 McDonalds common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on McDonalds common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted average strike price of $32.66 per share, or an aggregate of $475,692,000, expire on various dates between July 30, 2007 and September 10, 2007 and provide for net cash settlement. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points (up to 95 basis points under certain circumstances) and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate purchase price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. In the three months ended March 31, 2006, we sold 2,119,500 of the option shares in the derivative position at a weighted average sales price of $35.49. In the three months ended June 30, 2006, we acquired an additional 1,250,000 option shares at a weighted average purchase price of $33.08. As of December 31, 2006, there are 13,696,000 option shares in the derivative position with an adjusted weighted average strike price of $32.70 per share or an aggregate of $447,822,000. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $138,815,000, representing the mark to market of the shares in the derivative to $44.33 per share, net of the expense resulting from the LIBOR charges. Our aggregate net gain from inception of this investment in 2005 through December 31, 2006 is $168,557,000. 66 Overview continued 2006 Dispositions Investment in Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears) In August and September 2004, we acquired an economic interest in 7,916,900 Sears common shares through a series of privately negotiated transactions with a financial institution pursuant to which we purchased a call option and simultaneously sold a put option at the same strike price on Sears common shares. These call and put options had an initial weighted average strike price of $39.82 per share, or an aggregate of $315,250,000. Under these agreements, the strike price for each pair of options increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points and is credited for the dividends received on the shares. The options provide us with the same economic gain or loss as if we had purchased the underlying common shares and borrowed the aggregate strike price at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 45 basis points. Because these options are derivatives and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the options at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. On March 30, 2005, as a result of the merger between Sears and Kmart and pursuant to the terms of the contract, our derivative position representing 7,916,900 Sears common shares became a derivative position representing 2,491,819 common shares of Sears Holdings, Inc. (Sears Holdings) (NYSE: SHLD) valued at $323,936,000 based on the then closing share price of $130.00 and $146,663,000 of cash. As a result, we recognized a net gain of $58,443,000 based on the fair value of the derivative position on March 30, 2005. In 2005 we sold 402,660 of the option shares at a weighted average sales price of $124.44 per share. In the first quarter of 2006, we settled the entire derivative position by selling the remaining 2,089,159 option shares at a weighted average sales price of $125.43 which resulted in a net gain of $18,611,000, comprised of $20,673,000 from the remaining option shares sold, partially offset by $2,062,000 of expense resulting from the increase in strike price for the LIBOR charge. Our aggregate net gain realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through settlement was $142,877,000. Investment in Sears Canada, Inc. (Sears Canada) On April 3, 2006, we tendered the 7,500,000 Sears Canada shares we owned to Sears Holdings at the increased tender price of Cdn. $18.00 per share (the equivalent at that time of US $15.68 per share), which resulted in a net gain of $55,438,000 representing the difference between the tender price, and our carrying amount of $8.29 per share. The net gain is reflected as a component of net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate on our consolidated statement of income.

The net proceeds received were used for general corporate purposes. We may redeem the Series D 15 Units at a price of $25.00 per unit after May 2, 2011. On May 5, 2006, we repaid the existing debt on the Warner Building and completed an interest only refinancing of $292,700,000. The loan bears interest at 6.26% and matures in May 2016. We realized net proceeds of $133,000,000, after repaying the existing loan, closing costs and a prepayment penalty of $9,818,000. As part of the purchase price accounting for the December 27, 2005 acquisition of the Warner Building, we accrued a liability for the unfavorable terms of the debt assumed in the acquisition. Accordingly, the prepayment penalty did not result in an expense on our consolidated statement of income. On May 23, 2006, we completed a $115,000,000 refinancing of the Bowen Building.

As a result of the defeasance of the existing loan, we incurred a net loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2,498,000, which is included in interest and debt expense in the year ended December 31, 2006. On June 28, 2006, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $600,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to mature in July 2006. The new facility has a four year term, with a one year extension option and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.87% as of December 31, 2006).

The proceeds were used to repay $449,000,000 of fixed rate mortgages with a rate of 6.89% and the $430,000,000 financing described above. The mortgages that were repaid were collateralized by 84 temperature controlled warehouses which were released upon repayment. The new loan is collateralized by 50 of these warehouses.

The Preferred Units were redeemed on September 21, 2006 at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per unit or an aggregate of $45,000,000 plus accrued distributions. In conjunction with the redemption, we expensed $1,125,000 of issuance costs in 2006. On August 1, 2006, we repaid the $31,980,000 balance of the One and Two Skyline Place mortgages.

The loan bears interest at 6.34% and matures in August 2016. We received net proceeds of approximately $108,500,000 after defeasing the existing loans and closing costs, which were used for general corporate purposes. As a result of the defeasance of the existing loans, we incurred an $8,548,000 net loss on the early extinguishment of debt, which is included in interest and debt expense in the year ended December 31, 2006.

On November 20, 2006, we sold $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% convertible senior debentures due 2026, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discounts and expenses, were approximately $980,000,000. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for common shares of Vornado Realty Trust at an initial conversion rate of 6.5168 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price of $153.45 represents a premium of 30% over the November 14, 2006 closing price of $118.04 for our common shares. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2011 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2011, 2016, and 2021 and in the event of a change in control. The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds primarily for acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes. On November 22, 2006, the Merchandise Mart Division completed a $550,000,000 interest only, secured financing, which bears interest at a rate of 5.57% and matures in December 2016. The net proceeds of approximately $548,000,000 were used for general corporate purposes.

We received net proceeds of approximately $1,004,500,000, after offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 8,100,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership. 70 Overview continued 2006 Other Developments GMH Communities L.P. On July 20, 2004, we committed to make up to a $159,000,000 convertible preferred investment in GMH Communities L.P. (GMH), a partnership focused on the student and military housing sectors. Distributions accrued on the full committed balance of the investment, whether or not drawn, from July 20, 2004, at a rate of 16.27%. In connection with this commitment, we received a placement fee of $3,200,000. We also purchased for $1,000,000 warrants to acquire GMH common equity. The warrants entitled us to acquire (i) 6,666,667 limited partnership units in GMH at an exercise price of $7.50 per unit and (ii) 5,496,724 limited partnership units at an exercise price of $9.10 per unit, through May 2, 2006 and are adjusted for dividends declared by GMH Communities Trust (NYSE: GCT) (GCT). We funded a total of $113,777,000 of the commitment as of November 3, 2004. On November 3, 2004, GCT closed its initial public offering (IPO) at a price of $12.00 per share. GCT is a real estate investment trust that conducts its business through GMH, of which it is the sole general partner. In connection with the IPO, (i) the $113,777,000 we previously funded under the $159,000,000 commitment was repaid, together with accrued distributions of $13,381,000, (ii) we contributed our 90% interest in Campus Club Gainesville, which we acquired in 2000, in exchange for an additional 671,190 GMH limited partnership units and (iii) we exercised our first tranche of warrants to acquire 6,666,667 limited partnership units at a price of $7.50 per unit, or an aggregate of $50,000,000, which resulted in a gain of $29,500,000. On May 2, 2006, the date our remaining GMH warrants were to expire, we received 1,817,247 GCT common shares through an automatic cashless exercise. The amount of the shares received was equal to the excess of GCTs average closing share price for the trailing 20 day period ending on May 1, 2006 and the $8.22 exercise price, divided by GCTs average closing share price for the trailing 20 day period ending on May 1, 2006, then multiplied by 6,085,180 warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized a net loss of $16,370,000, the difference between the value of the GCT common shares received on May 2, 2006 and GCTs closing share price of $15.51 on December 31, 2005. From inception of our investment in the warrants, including the first tranche of warrants exercised on November 3, 2004, the aggregate net gain recognized was $51,399,000. The warrants were accounted for as derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from the mark to market of the warrants at the end of each reporting period were recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. In the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recognized income of $14,079,000 and $24,190,000, respectively, from the mark to market of these warrants which were valued using a trinomial option pricing model based on GCTs closing stock price on the NYSE of $15.51 and $14.10 per share on December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we own 7,337,857 GMH limited partnership units (which are exchangeable on a one for one basis into common shares of GCT) and 2,517,247 common shares of GCT (1,817,247 shares were received upon exercise of our warrants discussed below), or 13.5% of the limited partnership interest of GMH. We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements. On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005. Accordingly, we recognized a net loss of $1,013,000 during the year ended December 31, 2006 for our share of GMHs results of operations from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006. Of this amount, $94,000 represents our share of GMHs 2005 fourth quarter net loss, net of adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005. 71 Overview continued H Street Building Corporation (H Street). On July 20, 2005, we acquired H Street for approximately $246,600,000, consisting of $194,500,000 in cash and $52,100,000 for our pro rata share of existing mortgage debt. H Street owns, directly or indirectly through stock ownership in corporations, a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, including 34 acres of land leased to various residential and retail operators, a 1,670 unit apartment complex, 10 acres of land and two office buildings located in Washington, DC containing 577,000 square feet. We consolidate the accounts of H Street into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. On July 22, 2005, two corporations owned 50% by H Street filed a complaint against the Company, H Street and three parties affiliated with the sellers of H Street in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging that we encouraged H Street and the affiliated parties to breach their fiduciary duties to these corporations and interfered with prospective business and contractual relationships. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and a rescission of our acquisition of H Street. On September 12, 2005, we filed a complaint against each of those corporations and their acting directors seeking a restoration of H Streets full shareholder rights and damages. In addition, on July 29, 2005, a tenant under ground leases for which one of these 50% owned corporations is landlord brought a separate suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging, among other things, that the acquisition of H Street violated a provision giving them a right of first offer and seeks rescission of our acquisition, the right to acquire H Street for the price paid by us and or damages. On July 14, 2006, we filed a counterclaim against the tenant asserting that the tenant and the other owner of the 50% owned ground landlord deliberately excluded H Street from negotiating and executing a purported amendment to the agreement to lease when H Streets consent and execution was required and, consequently, that the amended agreement and the related ground leases are invalid, the tenant is in default under the ground leases and the ground leases are void and without any effect. These legal actions are currently in the discovery stage. We believe that the actions filed against us are without merit and that we will ultimately be successful in defending against them. Prior to June 30, 2006, the two 50% owned entities that are contesting our acquisition of H Street impeded access to their financial information and accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. During the second half of 2006, based on the financial information they provided to us, we recognized equity in net income of $11,074,000 from these entities, of which $3,890,000 represented our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005. The Lexington Master Limited Partnership, formerly The Newkirk Master Limited Partnership We own approximately 8,149,592 limited partnership units (representing a 7.4% ownership interest) of Lexington Master Limited Partnership (Lexington MLP) as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk Realty Trust (Newkirk) by Lexington Corporate Properties Trust (Lexington) discussed below. On December 31, 2006, Newkirk (NYSE: NKT) was acquired in a merger by Lexington (NYSE: LXP), a real estate investment trust. We owned 10,186,991 limited partnership units (representing a 15.8% ownership interest) of Newkirk MLP, which was also acquired by Lexington as a subsidiary, and was renamed Lexington MLP. The units in Newkirk MLP were converted on a 0.80 for 1 basis into limited partnership units of Lexington MLP, which are exchangeable on a one for one basis into common shares of Lexington. We account for our investment in Lexington MLP on the equity method. The assets of Newkirk MLP consisted of 18.4 million square feet of real estate across 32 states. After completion of the merger, Lexingtons total portfolio is comprised of approximately 365 properties containing an aggregate of 58.6 million square feet, located in 44 states and The Netherlands. In addition, effective as of the effective time of the merger, Newkirk terminated its advisory agreement with NKT Advisors, in which we had a 20.0% interest, for an aggregate payment of $12,500,000, of which our share was $2,300,000. On December 31, 2006, we recognized a net gain of $10,362,000, as a result of the above transactions. 72 Overview continued Unsecured Notes Consent Solicitation On May 9, 2006, we executed supplemental indentures with respect to our senior unsecured notes due 2007, 2009 and 2010 (collectively, the Notes), pursuant to our consent solicitation statement dated April 18, 2006, as amended. Holders of approximately 96.7% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes consented to the solicitation. The supplemental indentures contain modifications of certain covenants and related defined terms governing the terms of the Notes to make them consistent with corresponding provisions of the covenants and defined terms included in the senior unsecured notes due 2011 issued on February 16, 2006. The supplemental indentures also include a new covenant that provides for an increase in the interest rate of the Notes upon certain decreases in the ratings assigned by rating agencies to the Notes. In connection with the consent solicitation we paid an aggregate fee of $2,241,000 to the consenting note holders, which will be amortized into expense over the remaining term of the Notes. In addition, we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating $1,415,000, which were expensed in the second quarter of 2006. 73 Overview continued Leasing Activity The following table summarizes, by business segment, the leasing statistics which we view as key performance indicators.

Space previously occupied by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (PTO) During 2004 and 2005, the PTO vacated 1,939,000 square feet of space at our Crystal City properties. Of this space, Crystal Plaza Two, Three and Four, aggregating 712,000 square feet was taken out of service for redevelopment. During 2006, the redevelopment of Crystal Plaza Three and Four, aggregating 531,000 square feet, was substantially completed, placed into service and re leased. As of December 31, 2006, we have re leased a total of 1,247,000 square feet of the former PTO space and 181,000 square feet, representing Crystal Plaza Two, remains out of service for conversion to a 19 story residential tower. 75 Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $11.6 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141: Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If we incorrectly estimate the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows, initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different. The impact of our estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Identified Intangible Assets Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets were $304,252,000 and $192,375,000, respectively. Such amounts are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $307,809,000 and $150,892,000, of identified intangible liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, which are included in deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets. If these assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. 76 Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable We record mortgages and notes receivable at the stated principal amount net of any discount or premium. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of Notes and Mortgage Loans Receivable were $561,164,000 and $363,565,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The impact of our estimates in connection with the collectibility of both interest and principal of our loans could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1.45 billion and $1.37 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($17,727,000 and $16,907,000 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($2,334,000 and $6,051,000 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 77 Revenue Recognition We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rent income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Percentage Rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenue income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Shows Revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Temperature Controlled Logistics revenue income arising from our investment in AmeriCold. Storage and handling revenue are recognized as services are provided. Transportation fees are recognized upon delivery to customers. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of our revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT and substantial adverse tax consequences may result. 78 Recently Issued Accounting Literature On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123 and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on the modified prospective method on January 1, 2006. This adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3 (SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of the change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We adopted SFAS No. 154 on January 1, 2006. This adoption had no effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments An Amendment of SFAS No. 133 and No. 140 (SFAS No. 155). The purpose of SFAS No. 155 is to simplify the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an Amendment of SFAS No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). SFAS No. 156 requires separate recognition of a servicing asset and a servicing liability each time an entity undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract. This statement also requires that servicing assets and liabilities be initially recorded at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the fair value at the end of each reporting period. This statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 establishes new evaluation and measurement processes for all income tax positions taken. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosures of income tax matters. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This statement clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2008 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 79 Recently Issued Accounting Literature continued In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to (i) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plans over funded status or a liability for a plans under funded status; (ii) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (iii) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. Those changes will be reported in comprehensive income. The adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), which becomes effective for the first fiscal period ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 provides for the quantification of the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. The adoption of SAB 108 on December 31, 2006 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not decided if we will early adopt SFAS No. 159 or if we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. 80 Net income and EBITDA by Segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

(2) At December 31, 2004, 7 West 34th Street, a 440,000 square foot New York office building, was 100% occupied by four tenants, of which Health Insurance Plan of New York (HIP) and Fairchild Publications occupied 255,000 and 146,000 square feet, respectively. Effective January 4, 2005, we entered into a lease termination agreement with HIP under which HIP made an initial payment of $13,362 and is anticipated to make annual payments ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 over the remaining six years of the HIP lease contingent upon the level of operating expenses of the building in each year. In connection with the termination of the HIP lease, we expensed the $2,462 balance of the HIP receivable arising from the straight lining of rent. In the first quarter of 2005, we began redevelopment of a portion of this property into a permanent showroom building for the giftware industry. As of January 1, 2005, we transferred the operations and financial results related to the office component of this asset from the New York Office division to the Merchandise Mart division for both the current and prior periods presented. The operations and financial results related to the retail component of this asset were transferred to the Retail division for both current and prior periods presented. (3) Operating results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflect the consolidation of our investment in AmeriCold beginning on November 18, 2004. Previously, this investment was accounted for on the equity method.

(2) Primarily from higher marketing expenses for trade shows held in 2006. (3) Primarily from a reversal of $3,040 in allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents due to a change in estimate during the second quarter of 2006. (4) Primarily from $60,300 of transportation management services operating expenses in 2005 related to the services provided to a government agency in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, partially offset by a $16,000 increase in warehouse operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in utility rates. AmeriColds gross margin from owned warehouses was $150,000, or 31.2% for 2006, compared to $159,900, or 33.7% for 2005. The decrease in gross margin from owned warehouses was primarily due to higher facility costs as noted above. Gross margin from transportation management services, managed warehouses and other non warehouse activities was $8,400, or 2.8% for 2006, compared to $24,300, or 6.5% for 2005, a $15,900 decrease. This decrease was primarily due to higher transportation revenues last year as noted above. (5) The increase in corporate general and administrative expense results primarily from (i) $7,405 of amortization of stock based compensation, including the 2006 Out Performance Plan, stock option awards and restricted stock awards, (ii) $5,800 for our share of medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, (iii) an increase of $2,267 in professional fees, (iv) $2,299 from write offs of acquisitions not consummated and (v) an increase of $1,218 in deferred compensation expense due to an increase in the value of the deferred compensation plan, which is offset by an equal amount of investment income. 87 (Loss) Income Applicable to Alexanders Loss applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $14,530,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to income of $59,022,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $73,552,000. The decrease is primarily due to (i) a reduction in Alexanders net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums, of which our share is $26,315,000, as all of the condominium units have been sold and closed, (ii) an increase in Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation (SAR) expense, of which our share is $39,939,000, (iii) a $5,517,000 reduction in development and guarantee fees, primarily because 731 Lexington Avenue project was completed in 2005, and (iv) $6,122,000 of interest income in the prior year on loans to Alexanders that were repaid to us in July 2005, partially offset by, (v) an increase in Alexanders operating income, of which our share is $3,452,000. Loss Applicable to Toys In the first quarter of 2006, Toys closed 87 Toys R Us stores in the United States as a result of its store closing program. Toys incurred restructuring and other charges aggregating approximately $127,000,000 before tax, which includes $44,000,000 for the cost of liquidating the inventory. Of this amount, $94,000,000 was recognized in Toys fourth quarter ending January 28, 2006 and $33,000,000 was recorded in Toys first quarter ending April 29, 2006. Our 32.9% share of the $127,000,000 charge is $42,000,000, of which $27,300,000 had no income statement effect as a result of purchase price accounting and the remaining portion relating to the cost of liquidating inventory of approximately $9,100,000 after tax, was recognized as an expense as part of our equity in Toys net income in the first quarter of 2006. We recorded a net loss of $47,520,000 from our investment in Toys for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to a net loss of $40,496,000 in the prior year. The net loss in the current year consisted of (i) our $56,219,000 share of Toys net loss for the period from October 30, 2005 to October 28, 2006, which excludes our $9,377,000 share of the net gain recognized by Toys on the sale of 37 Toys R Us stores to us on October 16, 2006, which was recorded as an adjustment to the basis of our investment, partially offset by, (ii) $5,731,000 of interest income from our share of Toys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $2,968,000 of management fees. The net loss in the prior year consisted of (i) our $46,789,000 share of Toys net loss for the period ended July 21, 2005 (date of our acquisition) to October 29, 2005, partially offset by (ii) $5,043,000 of interest from our share of Toys senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250,000 of management fees. The unaudited information set forth below presents our pro forma condensed consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005 (including Toys results for the twelve months ended October 29, 2005) as if the above transaction occurred on February 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what our actual results would have been had the Toys transaction been consummated on February 1, 2004, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect this transaction have been made. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income For the Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share amounts) Actual Pro Forma 2006 2005 Revenues $ 2,712,095 $ 2,534,702 Income before allocation to minority limited partners $ 640,700 $ 656,924 Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership (58,712 ) (64,686 ) Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership (21,848 ) (67,119 ) Net income 560,140 525,119 Preferred share dividends (57,511 ) (46,501 ) Net income applicable to common shares $ 502,629 $ 478,618 Net income per common share basic $ 3.54 $ 3.58 Net income per common share diluted $ 3.35 $ 3.40 88 Income from Partially Owned Entities Summarized below are the components of income from partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Equity in Net Income (Loss): For The Year Ended December 31, (Amounts in thousands) 2006 2005 Newkirk MLP: 15.8% share of equity in net income $ 34,459 (1) $ 10,196 (1) Interest and other income 9,154 (2) 34,459 19,350 H Street: 50% share of equity in income 11,074 (3) Beverly Connection: 50% share of equity in net loss (8,567 ) (4,790 ) Interest and fee income 10,837 8,303 2,270 3,513 GMH Communities L.P: 13.5% in 2006 and 12.08% in 2005 share of equity in net (loss) income (1,013 )(4) 1,528 Other (5) 14,987 11,774 (6) $ 61,777 $ 36,165 (1) 2006 includes (i) a $10,362 net gain recognized as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington and (ii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate. 2005 includes (i) $9,445 for our share of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and write off of related deferred financing costs, (ii) $6,602 for our share of impairment losses, partially offset by (iii) $4,236 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate. Excluding the above items, our share of Newkirk MLPs net income was $8,750 lower than the prior year, primarily as a result of asset sales. (2) 2005 includes $16,053 for our share of net gains on disposition of T 2 assets, partially offset by $8,470 for our share of expense from payment of promoted obligations to partner. (3) We account for H Street partially owned entities on the equity method on a one quarter lag basis. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006, two 50% owned entities that are contesting our acquisition of H Street impeded access to their financial information and accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2006, based on the financial information provided to us, we recognized equity in net income of $11,074 from these entities, of which $3,890 represents our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005. (4) We account for our investment in GMH on the equity method and record our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis as we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time that GCT files its financial statements. On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005. Accordingly, we recognized a net loss of $1,013 the year ended December 31, 2006 for our share of GMHs earnings from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006. Of this amount, $94 represents our share of GMHs 2005 fourth quarter net loss, net of adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005. (5) Includes our equity in net earnings of partially owned entities including, partially owned office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others. (6) Includes $2,173 for a prepayment penalty from the Monmouth Mall venture in August 2005 upon the repayment of our initial preferred equity investment. 89 Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mortgage loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $262,188,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $167,220,000 in the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $94,968,000. This increase resulted from the following: (Amounts in thousands) Increase (decrease) due to: McDonalds derivative position net gain of $138,815 this year compared to $17,254 in the prior year $ 121,561 GMH warrants derivative position net loss of $16,370 this year compared to a net gain of $14,080 in the prior year (30,450 ) Sears Holding derivative position and common shares net gain of $18,611 this year compared to $41,482 in the prior year (investment sold in the first quarter of 2006) (22,871 ) Sears Canada income in 2005 as a result of special dividend (22,885 ) Mezzanine loans income of $56,496 this year compared to $39,548 in the prior year primarily as a result of new loans in 2006 aggregating $360,000, partially offset by the repayment of an aggregate of $168,000 during 2006 16,948 Other derivatives net gain of $12,153 this year 12,153 Other, net primarily due to interest earned on higher average cash balances 20,512 $ 94,968 Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $477,775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $339,952,000 in the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $137,823,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $69,200,000 from a $3.2 billion increase in outstanding debt due to property acquisitions and refinancings, (ii) $13,000,000 from a 117 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate of debt, (iii) $12,300,000 from the February 16, 2006 issuance of $250,000,000 unsecured notes due 2011, (iv) $33,400,000 for loan defeasance costs and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, partially offset by, (v) $10,614,000 of an increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development this year. Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $76,073,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 consists primarily of net gains on sale of marketable equity securities. Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates to the disposition of the Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for the net gain on disposition of the Companys senior preferred equity investment in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on sale of land parcels. Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including AmeriCold, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall. Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $20,173,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to expense of $3,808,000 in the prior year, a change of $23,981,000. This change relates primarily to AmeriCold, which had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. 90 Discontinued Operations The combined results of operations of the assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 include the operating results of Vineland, New Jersey; 33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City, which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006. (Amounts in thousands) December 31, 2006 2005 Total revenues $ 2,464 $ 15,374 Total expenses 2,825 11,473 Net (loss) income (361 ) 3,901 Net gains on sale of real estate 33,769 31,614 Income from discontinued operations $ 33,408 $ 35,515 On March 13, 2006, we sold 424 Sixth Avenue, a 10,000 square foot retail property located in New York City, for $22,000,000, which resulted in a net gain of $9,218,000. On March 14, 2006, we sold 33 North Dearborn Street, a 336,000 square foot office building located in Chicago, Illinois, for $46,000,000, which resulted in a net gain of $4,835,000. On June 22, 2006, we sold 1919 South Eads Street, a 96,000 square foot office building located in Arlington, Virginia for $38,400,000, which resulted in a net gain of $17,609,000. On April 21, 2005, we, through our 85% joint venture, sold 400 North LaSalle, a 452 unit high rise residential tower in Chicago, Illinois, for $126,000,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $31,614,000. Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $21,848,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $67,119,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $45,271,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of an aggregate of $742,000,000 8.25% Series D preferred units (Series D 3 through D 9) during 2005 and 2006, partially offset by the issuance of $100,000,000 6.75% D 14 units in September 2005 and the issuance of the $45,000,000 6.875% D 15 units in May and August 2006. See preferred share dividends discussion below for details of aggregate amounts outstanding. Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $58,712,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $66,755,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $8,043,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A operating partnership units into our common shares during 2006 and 2005. Preferred Share Dividends Preferred share dividends were $57,511,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $46,501,000 for the prior year, an increase of $11,010,000. This increase resulted primarily from dividends paid on the 6.75% Series H and 6.625% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares which were issued in June 2005 and August 2005, respectively, partially offset by a $3,852,000 write off of issuance costs in the first quarter of 2005 related to the redemption of the Series C preferred shares. We have an aggregate of $1.2 billion perpetual preferred shares and Operating Partnership units outstanding with a weighted average rate of 6.6% as of December 31, 2006, as compared to an aggregate of $1.2 billion with a weighted average rate of 6.6% as of December 31, 2005, and $1.5 billion with a weighted average rate of 7.5% as of December 31, 2004. 91 EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA.

Beginning on January 1, 2006, we have revised our definition of same store operations to exclude divisional general and administrative expenses. We utilize this measure to make decisions on whether to buy or sell properties as well as to compare the performance of our properties to that of our peers. Same store operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 92 Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 Revenues Our revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant expense reimbursements, hotel revenues, trade shows revenues, amortization of acquired below market leases net of above market leases pursuant to SFAS No. 141 and 142, and fee income, were $2,534,702,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $1,699,694,000 in the prior year, an increase of $835,008,000.

(2) From increases in operating expenses, including $7,588 in real estate taxes and $10,155 in utility costs, net of a $5,376 reduction in bad debt expense and other expenses. (3) Primarily due to a $3,000 reduction in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in utilities expense of $904. (4) Primarily from the increase in payroll and benefits resulting from the growth in this segment. (5) Primarily from (i) a $547 increase in payroll and benefits, (ii) a $401 write off of pre acquisition costs, (iii) $354 for costs incurred in connection with a tenant escalation dispute settled in our favor and (iv) a $286 increase in income tax expense. (6) The decrease in general and administrative expenses results from: Bonuses to four executive vice presidents in connection with the successful leasing, development and financing of Alexanders in 2004 $ (6,500 ) Cost of Vornado Operating Company litigation in 2004 (4,643 ) Increase in payroll and fringes in 2005 3,244 Charitable contributions in 2005 1,119 Other, net 1,364 $ (5,416 ) (7) Costs expensed in 2004 as a result of an acquisition not consummated. Income Applicable to Alexanders Income applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $59,022,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $8,580,000 for the prior year, an increase of $50,442,000. The increase is primarily due to (i) $30,895,000 for our share of Alexanders after tax net gain on sale of condominiums in 2005, (ii) a decrease in Alexanders stock appreciation rights compensation (SAR) expense, of which our share is $16,236,000, (iii) income from Alexanders 731 Lexington Avenue property which was placed into service subsequent to the third quarter of 2004, (iv) an increase of $2,465,000 in development and guarantee fees, (v) an increase of $1,399,000 in management and leasing fees, partially offset by, (vi) a decrease of $2,520,000 in interest income on our loans to Alexanders which were repaid in July 2005 and (vii) $1,274,000 for our share of a gain on sale of land parcel in 2004. 96 Loss Applicable to Toys R Us The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.9% share of Toys net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, we recorded our share of Toys fourth quarter net income in our first quarter of 2006. Equity in net loss from Toys for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2005 was $40,496,000 which consisted of (i) our $1,977,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys second quarter ended July 30, 2005 for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through July 30, 2005, (ii) our $44,812,000 share of Toys net loss in Toys third quarter ended October 29, 2005, partially offset by, (iii) $5,043,000 of interest income on our senior unsecured bridge loan and (iv) $1,250,000 of management fees. The unaudited pro forma information set forth below presents our condensed consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (including Toys results for the twelve months ended October 29, 2005 and October 30, 2004, respectively) as if the above transactions had occurred on November 1, 2003. The unaudited pro forma information below is not necessarily indicative of what our actual results would have been had the Toys transactions been consummated on November 1, 2003, nor does it represent the results of operations for any future periods. In our opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect these transactions have been made. Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands, except per share amounts) For the Year Ended December 31, Pro Forma Pro Forma 2005 2004 Revenues $ 2,534,702 $ 1,699,694 Income before allocation to minority limited partners $ 656,924 $ 717,891 Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership (64,686 ) (84,063 ) Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership (67,119 ) (69,108 ) Net income 525,119 564,720 Preferred share dividends (46,501 ) (21,920 ) Net income applicable to common shares $ 478,618 $ 542,800 Net income per common share basic $ 3.58 $ 4.33 Net income per common share diluted $ 3.40 $ 4.08 97 Income from Partially Owned Entities Summarized below are the components of income from partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

(4) Includes $2,173 for a prepayment penalty from the Monmouth Mall venture in August 2005 upon the repayment of our initial preferred equity investment and $1,351 of income recognized from our $50,000 investment in Dune Capital L.P. made in 2005.

This decrease resulted from the following: (Amounts in thousands) Increase (decrease) due to: Income of $81,730 from the mark to market of Sears derivative position in 2004, partially offset by income of $14,968 in 2005 from the net gain on conversion of Sears derivative position to Sears Holdings derivative position on March 30, 2005 and mark to market adjustments through 2005 $ (66,762 ) Net gain on exercise of GMH warrants in 2004 (29,452 ) Net gain on conversion of Sears common shares to Sears Holdings common shares and sale in 2005 26,514 Income recognized as a result of Sears Canada special dividend in 2005 22,885 Income from the mark to market of McDonalds derivative position in 2005 17,254 Interest on $159,000 commitment to GMH in 2004, which was satisfied in November 2004 (16,581 ) Income of $24,190 from the mark to market of GMH warrants in 2004, partially offset by income of $14,080 from the mark to market of the warrants in through 2005 (10,110 ) Other, net primarily due to higher yields on higher average amounts invested 19,474 $ (36,778 ) Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $339,952,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $242,142,000 in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $97,810,000. This increase is primarily due to (i) $49,893,000 resulting from the consolidation of our investment in AmeriCold from November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method previously, (ii) $26,199,000 from a 2.27% increase in the weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt, (iii) $15,335,000 of interest expense on the $500,000,000 exchangeable senior debentures issued in March 2005 and (iv) $6,881,000 of additional interest expense on the $250,000,000 senior unsecured notes due 2009, which were issued in August 2004. Net Gain on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $39,042,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 is comprised of (i) $25,346,000 of net gains on sales of marketable equity securities, of which $9,017,000 relates to the disposition of Prime Group common shares, (ii) $12,110,000 for the net gain on disposition of our senior preferred equity investment in 3700 Las Vegas Boulevard and (iii) $1,586,000 relates to net gains on sale of land parcels. Net gain on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate of $19,775,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represents an $18,789,000 net gain on sale of a portion of our investment in AmeriCold to Yucaipa in November 2004. Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities Minority interest expense of partially owned entities was $3,808,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $109,000 in the prior year, an increase of $3,699,000. This increase resulted primarily from the consolidation of our investment in AmeriCold beginning on November 18, 2004 versus accounting for the investment on the equity method in the prior year. 99 Discontinued Operations Assets related to discontinued operations consist primarily of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation. The following table sets forth the balances of the assets related to discontinued operations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

All of the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in tax free like kind exchange investments in accordance with Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. In anticipation of selling the Palisades Residential Complex, on February 27, 2004, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in the Palisades venture that we did not previously own for approximately $17,000,000 in cash. On June 29, 2004, we sold the Palisades for $222,500,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $65,905,000. On August 12, 2004, we sold our Dundalk, Maryland shopping center for $12,900,000, which resulted in a net gain on sale after closing costs of $9,850,000. Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $67,119,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $69,108,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $1,989,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of (i) $80,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 3 preferred units in January 2005, (ii) $245,000,000 of the remaining 8.25% Series D 3 and D 4 preferred units in July 2005, (iii) $342,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 5 and D 7 preferred units in September 2005 and (iv) $30,000,000 of the 8.25% Series D 6 and D 8 preferred units in December 2005, partially offset by, (v) a $19,017,000 write off of the issuance costs of the preferred units redeemed in 2005, and (vi) distributions to holders of the 7.20% Series D 11 and 6.55% Series D 12 units issued in May and December 2004. 100 Minority Limited Partners Interest in the Operating Partnership Minority limited partners interest in the Operating Partnership was $66,755,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $88,091,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $21,336,000. This decrease results primarily from a lower minority limited partnership ownership interest due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into Vornado common shares during 2004 and 2005, and lower net income subject to allocation to the minority limited partners. EBITDA Below are the details of the changes by segment in EBITDA. Office Temperature (Amounts in thousands) Total New York Washington, DC Retail Merchandise Mart Controlled Logistics Toys Other Year ended December 31, 2004 $ 1,204,850 $ 330,689 $ 304,200 $ 177,826 $ 134,930 $ 71,514 $ $ 185,691 2005 Operations: Same store operations(1) 13,811 (13,521 ) 4,977 5,788 Acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses (2,899 ) 98 29,897 8,374 4,252 14,860 (4) Year ended December 31, 2005 $ 1,301,628 $ 341,601 $ 290,777 $ 212,700 $ 149,092 $ 75,766 $ 14,860 $ 216,832 % increase (decrease) in same store operations 4.3% (4.7% ) 3.2% 4.7% (2) N/A (3) (1) Represents operations which were owned for the same period in each year and excludes non recurring income and expenses which are included in acquisitions, dispositions and non same store income and expenses above. (2) EBITDA and the same store percentage increase reflect the commencement of the WPP Group leases (228 square feet) in the third quarter of 2004 and the Chicago Sun Times lease (127 square feet) in the second quarter of 2004. The same store percentage increase in EBITDA exclusive of these leases was 0.9%. (3) Not comparable because prior to November 4, 2004, (the date the operations of AmeriCold Logistics were combined with AmeriCold Realty Trust), we reflected our equity in the rent AmeriCold received from AmeriCold Logistics. Subsequent thereto, we consolidate the operations of the combined company. (4) The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. Because Toys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January 31, we record our 32.9% share of Toys net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, we recorded our share of Toys fourth quarter net income in our first quarter of 2006. Toys EBITDA above includes (i) our share of Toys EBITDA for the period from July 21, 2005 (date of acquisition) through October 29, 2005, (ii) $5,043 of interest income on our senior unsecured bridge loan and (iii) $1,250 of management fees. 101 Supplemental Information Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 Below is a summary of Net Income and EBITDA by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the third quarter of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. The Temperature Controlled Logistics segment has experienced higher earnings in the fourth quarter due to higher activity and occupancy in its warehouse operations due to the holiday seasons impact on the food industry.

The loan was made to him in 1996 pursuant to his employment agreement. On December 31, 2006, 1,546,106 shares held in a rabbi trust, established for deferred compensation purposes as part of Mr. Fascitellis 1996 and 2001 employment agreements, were distributed to Mr. Fascitelli, net of 739,130 shares which were used to satisfy the resulting tax withholding obligation. The shares we received for the tax liability were retired upon receipt. On December 22, 2005, Steven Roth, our Chief Executive Officer, repaid to the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan which was scheduled to mature in January 2006. Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis. Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan. Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding. On December 23, 2005, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 4.45% per annum and matures on December 23, 2011. On February 22, 2005, we entered into a new employment agreement with Sandeep Mathrani, Executive Vice President Retail Division. Pursuant to the agreement, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Mathrani (i) 16,836 restricted shares of our stock, (ii) stock options to acquire 300,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $71.275 per share and (iii) the right to receive 200,000 stock options over the next two years at the then prevailing market price. In addition, Mr. Mathrani repaid the $500,000 loan we provided him under his prior employment agreement. On March 11, 2004, we loaned $2,000,000 to Melvyn Blum, an executive officer, pursuant to the revolving credit facility contained in his January 2000 employment agreement. Melvyn Blum resigned effective July 15, 2005. In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, his $2,000,000 outstanding loan was repaid in August 2005. Pursuant to our annual compensation review in February 2002 with Joseph Macnow, our Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved a $2,000,000 loan to Mr. Macnow, which bears interest at the applicable federal rate of 4.65% per annum and matures in June 2007. The loan was funded on July 23, 2002 and is collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the loan amount. Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees Alexanders We own 32.8% of Alexanders. Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexanders. We provide various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 6 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10 K. On December 29, 2005, Michael Fascitelli, our President and President of Alexanders, exercised 350,000 of his Alexanders stock appreciation rights (SARs) which were scheduled to expire in December 2006 and received $173.82 for each SAR exercised, representing the difference between Alexanders stock price of $247.70 (the average of the high and low market price) on the date of exercise and the exercise price of $73.88. This exercise was consistent with Alexanders tax planning. On January 10, 2006, the Omnibus Stock Plan Committee of the Board of Directors of Alexanders granted Mr. Fascitelli a SAR covering 350,000 shares of Alexanders common stock. The exercise price of the SAR is $243.83 per share of common stock, which was the average of the high and low trading price of Alexanders common stock on date of grant. The SAR became exercisable on July 10, 2006, provided Mr. Fascitelli is employed with Alexanders on such date, and will expire on March 14, 2007. Mr. Fascitellis early exercise and Alexanders related tax consequences were factors in Alexanders decision to make the new grant to him. 106 Interstate Properties (Interstate) Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2006, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.5% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.6% of Alexanders common stock. We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $798,000, $791,000 and $726,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Vornado Operating Company (Vornado Operating) In October 1998, Vornado Operating was spun off from Vornado in order to own assets that we could not own and conduct activities that we could not conduct as a REIT. Vornado Operatings primary asset was its 60% investment in AmeriCold Logistics, which leased 88 refrigerated warehouses from AmeriCold, owned 60% by us. On November 4, 2004, AmeriCold purchased its tenant, AmeriCold Logistics, for $47,700,000 in cash. As part of this transaction, Vornado Operating repaid the $21,989,000 balance of its loan to us as well as $4,771,000 of unpaid interest. Because we fully reserved for the interest income on this loan beginning in January 2002, we recognized $4,771,000 of income upon collection in 2004. In November 2004, a class action shareholder derivative lawsuit was brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Vornado Operating, its directors and Vornado. The lawsuit sought to enjoin the dissolution of Vornado Operating, rescind the previously completed sale of AmeriCold Logistics (owned 60% by Vornado Operating) to AmeriCold (owned 60% by us) and damages. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the Vornado Operating directors breached their fiduciary duties. On November 24, 2004, a stipulation of settlement was entered into under which we agreed to settle the lawsuit with a payment of approximately $4,500,000 or about $1 per Vornado Operating share or partnership unit before litigation expenses. We accrued the proposed settlement payment and related legal costs as part of general and administrative expense in 2004. On March 22, 2005, the Court approved the settlement. Other On December 20, 2005, we acquired a 46% partnership interest in, and became co general partner of, partnerships that own a complex in Rosslyn, Virginia, containing four office buildings with an aggregate of 714,000 square feet and two apartment buildings containing 195 rental units. The consideration for the acquisition consisted of 734,486 newly issued Operating Partnership units (valued at $61,814,000 at acquisition) and $27,300,000 for our pro rata share of existing debt. Of the partnership interest acquired, 19% was from Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod, trustees of Vornado, and their family members, representing all of their interest in the partnership. On April 13, 2006, we acquired the 92.65% interest that we did not already own of 1925 K Street, a 150,000 square foot office building located in the Central Business District of Washington, DC. The purchase price for the 92.65% interest was $52,800,000, consisting of $34,600,000 in cash and $18,200,000 of existing mortgage debt. Mitchell N. Schear, President of our Washington, DC Office division, received $3,675,000 for his share of the proceeds as a partner of the selling entity. 107 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings. Acquisitions and Investments We completed approximately $1.8 billion of real estate acquisitions and investments in 2006 and $2.4 billion in 2005. In addition, we made $356,000,000 of mezzanine loans during 2006 and $308,534,000 in 2005. These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Certain Future Cash Requirements For 2007 we have budgeted approximately $173,700,000 for capital expenditures excluding acquisitions as follows: Office (Amounts in millions except square foot data) Total New York Washington DC Retail Merchandise Mart Other (1) Expenditures to maintain assets $ 66.7 $ 15.0 $ 19.0 $ 2.0 $ 11.5 $ 19.2 Tenant improvements 84.5 10.4 47.5 3.3 23.3 Leasing commissions 22.5 5.2 10.9 2.6 3.8 Total Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions 107.0 15.6 58.4 5.9 27.1 Per square foot $ 33.00 $ 23.00 $ 12.00 $ 19.00 (2) $ Per square foot per annum $ 3.50 $ 3.50 $ 1.50 $ 3.00 (2) $ Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions $ 173.7 $ 30.6 $ 77.4 $ 7.9 $ 38.6 $ 19.2 Square feet budgeted to be leased (in thousands) 472 2,525 492 1,415 Weighted average lease term 9.5 6.2 8.7 6.1 (1) AmeriCold, Hotel Pennsylvania, and Warehouses. (2) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2007 leasing activity are $54.35 ($5.44 per annum) and $8.90 ($1.78 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively. In addition to the capital expenditures reflected above, we are currently engaged in certain development and redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.0 billion, of which $476,200,000 is estimated to be expended in 2007. The table above excludes the anticipated 2007 capital expenditures of Alexanders, Toys R Us or any other partially owned entity that we do not consolidate, as these entities are expected to fund their own cash requirements without additional equity contributions from us. 110 Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations See 2006 Financings in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the details of our 2006 financing activities. Details of our 2005 financing activities are summarized below. On January 19, 2005, we redeemed all of our 8.5% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per share or $115,000,000. In addition, we redeemed a portion of the Series D 3 Perpetual Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit or $80,000,000. The redemption amounts exceeded the carrying amounts by $6,052,000, representing the original issuance costs. Upon redemption, we wrote off these issuance costs as a reduction to earnings in 2005. On March 29, 2005, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 principal amount of 3.875% exchangeable senior debentures due 2025 pursuant to an effective registration statement. The notes were sold at 98.0% of their principal amount. The net proceeds from this offering, after the underwriters discount, were approximately $490,000,000. The debentures are exchangeable, under certain circumstances, for our common shares at an initial exchange rate of 10.9589 (current exchange rate of 11.1184, as adjusted for excess dividends paid in 2005 and 2006) common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial exchange price of $91.25 represented a premium of 30% to the closing price for Vornado common shares on March 22, 2005 of $70.25. We may elect to settle any exchange right in cash. The debentures permit us to increase our common dividend 5% per annum, cumulatively, without an increase to the exchange rate. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2015 and 2020 and in the event of a change in control. On June 17, 2005, we completed a public offering of $112,500,000 6.75% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, at a price of $25.00 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement. We may redeem the Series H Preferred Shares at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per share after June 17, 2010. We used the net proceeds of the offering of $108,956,000, together with existing cash balances, to redeem the remaining $120,000,000 8.25% Series D 3 Perpetual Preferred Units and the $125,000,000 8.25% Series D 4 Perpetual Preferred Units on July 14, 2005 at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit. In conjunction with the redemptions, we wrote off approximately $6,400,000 of issuance costs as a reduction to earnings in 2005. On August 10, 2005, we sold 9,000,000 common shares in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at a price of $86.75 per share. We received net proceeds of $779,806,000, after offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 9,000,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership. On August 23, 2005, we completed a public offering of $175,000,000 6.625% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a price of $25.00 per share, pursuant to an effective registration statement. We may redeem the Series I preferred shares at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per share after August 31, 2010. In addition, on August 31, 2005, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased $10,000,000 Series I preferred shares to cover over allotments. On September 12, 2005, we sold an additional $85,000,000 Series I preferred shares at a price of $25.00 per share, in a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement. Combined with the earlier sales, we sold a total of 10,800,000 Series I preferred shares for net proceeds of $262,898,000. The net proceeds were used primarily to redeem outstanding perpetual preferred units. On September 12, 2005, we sold $100,000,000 of 6.75% Series D 14 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership to an institutional investor in a private placement. The perpetual preferred units may be called without penalty at our option commencing in September 2010. The proceeds were used primarily to redeem outstanding perpetual preferred units. On September 19, 2005, we redeemed all of the Operating Partnerships 8.25% Series D 5 and D 7 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit for an aggregate of $342,000,000. In conjunction with the redemptions, we wrote off $9,642,000 of issuance costs as a reduction to earnings in 2005. On December 30, 2005, we redeemed the 8.25% Series D 6 and D 8 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership at their stated liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit for an aggregate of $30,000,000. In conjunction with these redemptions, we wrote off $750,000 of issuance costs as a reduction to earnings in 2005. 111 In addition to the financing activities above, we completed $716,600,000 of property level financings during 2005. The net proceeds we received from the above financings were primarily used to fund 2005 acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes, unless otherwise noted. We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facility and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2006 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well known seasoned issuer. We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect thereto. We may also offer our shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise re acquire our shares or any other securities in the future. Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006. (Amounts in thousands) Contractual Cash Obligations (principal and interest): Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Mortgages and Notes Payable $ 9,440,882 $ 740,232 $ 1,741,747 $ 1,717,961 $ 5,240,942 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2007 515,325 515,325 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 278,125 11,250 266,875 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 238,000 9,500 19,000 209,500 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 313,000 14,000 28,000 271,000 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2025 856,833 19,375 38,750 38,750 759,958 Convertible Senior Debentures due 2026 1,729,531 40,781 72,500 72,500 1,543,750 Operating leases 198,261 20,836 39,777 29,121 108,527 Purchase obligations, primarily construction commitments 133,130 122,730 10,400 Capital lease obligations 116,386 11,902 21,570 18,084 64,830 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 13,819,473 $ 1,505,931 $ 2,238,619 $ 2,356,916 $ 7,718,007 Commitments: Capital commitments to partially owned entities $ 73,560 $ 48,560 $ 25,000 $ $ Standby letters of credit 39,143 39,143 Mezzanine loan commitments 29,547 29,547 Other Guarantees Total Commitments $ 142,250 $ 117,250 $ 25,000 $ $ Revolving Credit Facilities On June 28, 2006, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $600,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility which was due to mature in July 2006. The new facility has a four year term, with a one year extension option and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.55% (5.87% as of December 31, 2006). The new facility contains financial covenants similar to the prior facility but have been modified to more accurately reflect the current market conditions in the real estate industry. As of December 31, 2006, we had a zero outstanding balance on this facility. At December 31, 2006, our $1 billion revolving credit facility had a zero outstanding balance and $20,732,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility contains financial covenants, which require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. At December 31, 2006, AmeriColds $30,000,000 revolving credit facility had a zero outstanding balance and $17,000,000 was reserved for outstanding letters of credit. This facility requires AmeriCold to maintain, on a trailing four quarter basis, a minimum of $30,000,000 of free cash flow, as defined. Both of these facilities contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. The Yucaipa Companies (Yucaipa) Earn out Pursuant to the November 18, 2004 sale by Vornado and Crescent Real Estate Equities Company (CEI), of 20.7% of AmeriCold to Yucaipa for $145,000,000, Yucaipa is entitled to receive up to 20% of the increase in the value of AmeriCold, realized through the sale of a portion of our and CEIs interest in AmeriCold subject to limitations, provided that AmeriColds Threshold EBITDA, as defined, exceeds $133,500,000 for the year ending December 31, 2007. 112 Other Commitments and Contingencies We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 which expires in 2007 and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Below is a summary of the current all risk property insurance and terrorism risk insurance in effect through September 2007 for each of the following business segments: Coverage Per Occurrence All Risk (1) Sub Limits for Acts of Terrorism New York Office $1.4 billion $750 million Washington, DC Office $1.4 billion $750 million Retail $500 million $500 million Merchandise Mart $1.4 billion $750 million Temperature Controlled Logistics $225 million $225 million (1) Limited as to terrorism insurance by the sub limit shown in the adjacent column. In addition to the coverage above, we carry lesser amounts of coverage for terrorist acts not covered by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non recourse to us), our senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements, contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain, or if the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 is not extended past 2007, it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Courts decision. On December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Courts decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Courts decision which has been submitted to the Appellate Court for consideration. We intend to pursue our claims against Stop & Shop vigorously. There are various other legal actions against us in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are committed to fund additional capital aggregating $73,560,000, related to our acquisitions and investments in partially owned entities. Of this amount, $25,000,000 relates to capital expenditures to be funded over the next six years at the Springfield Mall, in which we have a 97.5% interest. On November 10, 2005, we committed to fund up to $30,530,000 of the junior portion of a $173,000,000 construction loan to an entity developing a mix use building complex in Boston, Massachusetts, at the north end of the Boston Harbor. We will earn current pay interest at 30 day LIBOR plus 11%. The loan will mature in November 2008, with a one year extension option. As of December 31, 2006, we have funded $2,288,000 of this commitment. We enter into agreements for the purchase and resale of U.S. government obligations for periods of up to one week. The obligations purchased under these agreements are held in safekeeping in our name by various money center banks. We have the right to demand additional collateral or return of these invested funds at any time the collateral value is less than 102% of the invested funds plus any accrued earnings thereon. We had $219,990,000 and $177,650,000 of cash invested in these agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 113 Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Our cash and cash equivalents was $2,233,317,000 at December 31, 2006, a $1,938,813,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2005. This increase resulted from $824,668,000 of net cash provided by operating activities, $3,030,655,000 of net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by $1,916,510,000 of net cash used in investing activities. Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities. Our property rental income is primarily dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Other sources of liquidity to fund our cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans and corporate level unsecured borrowings; our $1 billion revolving credit facility; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership and distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs. Our consolidated outstanding debt was $9,554,798,000 at December 31, 2006, a $3,311,672,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2005. This increase resulted primarily from debt associated with asset acquisitions, property financings and refinancings and from the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior unsecured convertible debentures during 2006. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, our revolving credit facility had a zero outstanding balance. During 2007 and 2008, $778,482,000 and $358,403,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance such debt or choose to repay all or a portion, using existing cash balances or our revolving credit facility. Our share of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $3,323,007,000 at December 31, 2006, a $311,355,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2005. This increase resulted primarily from our $89,630,000 share of an increase in Toys R Us outstanding debt and from debt associated with asset acquisitions and refinancings. Cash flows provided by operating activities of $824,668,000 was primarily comprised of (i) net income of $560,140,000, (ii) adjustments for non cash items of $159,858,000, (iii) distributions of income from partially owned entities of $35,911,000 and (iv) a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $68,759,000.

Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Our cash and cash equivalents was $294,504,000 at December 31, 2005, a $304,778,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2004 of $599,282,000. This decrease resulted from $1,751,284,000 of net cash used in investing activities, partially offset by, $762,678,000 of net cash provided by operating activities and $683,828,000 of net cash provided by financing activities. Our investing activities consisted primarily of real estate asset acquisitions, investments in partially owned entities, loans made to real estate related entities and marketable securities purchases, including the McDonalds derivative during 2005.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 17 Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 186 of this annual report on Form 10 K. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $858,693,000, or $5.51 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $757,219,000, or $5.21 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2005. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $211,812,000 or $1.34 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2006, compared to $194,101,000, or $1.26 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2005.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1% Change In Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Consolidated debt: Variable rate (1) $ 728,363 6.48% $ 7,281 $ 1,150,333 5.98% Fixed rate 8,826,435 5.56% 5,104,550 6.06% $ 9,554,798 5.63% 7,281 $ 6,254,883 6.04% Pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities (non recourse): Variable rate excluding Toys $ 162,254 7.31% 1,623 $ 199,273 5.64% Variable rate Toys 1,213,479 7.03% 13,134 1,623,447 7.02% Fixed rate (including $1,057,422, and $557,844 of Toys debt in 2006 and 2005) 1,947,274 6.95% 1,179,626 7.23% $ 3,323,007 7.00% 14,757 $ 3,002,346 7.01% Minority limited partners share of above (2,226 ) Total change in annual net income $ 19,812 Per share diluted $ 0.13 (1) Includes $498,562 for our senior unsecured notes due 2007, as we entered into an interest rate swap that effectively converted the interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.625% to a floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.7725%, based upon the trailing three month LIBOR rate (6.13% if set on December 31, 2006). In accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended, we are required to record the fair value of this derivative instrument at each reporting period. At December 31, 2006, the fair value adjustment was a reduction of ($1,111), and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above. We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2006, we have a cap of 5.50% on the LIBOR component of outstanding variable rate debt with a notional amount of $130,000,000. We also have a reverse swap agreement as described in footnote (1) to the table above. As of December 31, 2006, we have notes and mortgage loans receivable aggregating $270,000,000, which are based on variable rates and partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates. Fair Value of Our Debt The carrying amount of our debt exceeds its aggregate fair value, based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt, by approximately $90,356,000 at December 31, 2006. Derivative Instruments We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, including an economic interest in McDonalds common shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we settled our derivative position in the common shares of Sears Holdings and exercised our warrants to purchase common shares of GMH Communities Trust. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $153,209,000, $46,302,000 and $135,372,000, respectively, from these positions. 121
