In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.5% interest in Alexanders, Inc., which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments. Our ultimate business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. The table below compares our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) and the SNL REIT Index (SNL) for the following periods ending December 31, 2008 (past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance): Total Returns Vornado RMS SNL One year (28.4%) (38.0%) (36.6%) Three years (19.3%) (29.9%) (27.8%) Five years 36.1% 3.4% 7.1% Ten years 202.8% 100.2% 107.3% We intend to achieve our ultimate business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is high likelihood of capital appreciation; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; Investing in fully integrated operating companies that have a significant real estate component; and Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value. We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors. In the second half of 2007 the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress, primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub prime mortgages, declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide. In 2008, the credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets. We are currently in an economic recession which has negatively affected all businesses, including ours. During the past year, real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen. Our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies, which may result in lower average occupancy rates and effective rents, and a corresponding decrease in net income, funds from operations and cash flow. In addition, the value of our assets, including investments in joint ventures, marketable securities, and mezzanine loans may also decline, and may result in impairment charges and or valuation allowances and a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations. 65 Overview continued Year Ended December 31, 2008 Financial Results Summary Net income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $337,952,000, or $2.14 per diluted share, versus $511,729,000, or $3.23 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Quarter Ended: New York Office Washington, DC Office Retail Merchandise Mart December 31, 2008 vs. December 31, 2007 6.1% 5.8% 4.0% (5.1%) December 31, 2008 vs. September 30, 2008 5.8% 6.2% 0.6% 15.8% 68 Overview continued Significant Activity during 2008 Reversal of Deferred Tax Liabilities In connection with the purchase accounting for H Street, in July 2005 and April 2007 we recorded an aggregate of $222,174,000 of deferred tax liabilities representing the differences between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets and liabilities multiplied by the effective tax rate. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income. Lexington Realty Trust (Lexington) (NYSE: LXP) Prior to October 28, 2008, we owned 8,149,592 limited partnership units of the Lexington Master Limited Partnership (Lexington MLP) which were exchangeable on a one for one basis into Lexington common shares, or a 7.7% limited partnership interest. On October 28, 2008, we acquired 8,000,000 common shares of Lexington for $5.60 per share, or $44,800,000. The purchase price consisted of $22,400,000 in cash and a $22,400,000 margin loan recourse only to the 8,000,000 shares acquired. In addition, we exchanged our existing limited partnership units in Lexington MLP for 8,149,592 Lexington common shares. As of December 31, 2008, we own 16,149,592 Lexington common shares, or approximately 17.2% of Lexingtons common equity. We account for our investment in Lexington on the equity method and record our pro rata share of Lexingtons net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements. Based on Lexingtons December 31, 2008 closing share price of $5.00, the market value (fair value pursuant to SFAS 157) of our investment in Lexington was $80,748,000, or $100,707,000 below the carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet. We have concluded that our investment in Lexington is other than temporarily impaired and recorded a $100,707,000 non cash impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Together with the impairment charge recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $107,882,000 of non cash charges on our investment in Lexington during 2008. Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term. These charges are included as a component of (loss) income from partially owned entities, on our consolidated statement of income. Marketable Securities At December 31, 2008, we concluded that certain of our investments in marketable equity securities were other than temporarily impaired, based on the severity and duration of the declines in the market value (fair value pursuant to SFAS 157) of these securities and recognized non cash impairment charges aggregating $55,471,000, based on December 31, 2008 closing share prices. Together with impairment charges recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized an aggregate of $76,352,000 of non cash impairment charges on these investments during 2008. Our conclusions were based on the recent deterioration in the capital and financial markets and our inability to forecast a recovery in the near term. These charges are included as a component of interest and other investment (loss) income, net, on our consolidated statement of income. Real Estate Development Projects During 2008, we recognized non cash charges aggregating $96,037,000, for the write off of our share of certain partially owned entities development costs, as these projects were either deferred or abandoned. These charges include $37,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the redevelopment of the Filenes property in Boston, Massachusetts and $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2008, for our 50% share of costs in connection with the abandonment of the arena move/Moynihan East portions of the Farley project. These charges are included as a component of (loss) income from partially owned entities, on our consolidated statement of income. During 2008, we also recognized non cash charges aggregating $81,447,000, of which $73,438,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to residential condominium projects under development. 69 Overview continued MPH Mezzanine Loan On June 5, 2007, we acquired a 42% interest in two MPH mezzanine loans totaling $158,700,000, for $66,000,000 in cash. The loans, which were due on February 8, 2008 and have not been repaid, are subordinate to $2.9 billion of mortgage and other debt and secured by the equity interests in four New York City properties: Worldwide Plaza, 1540 Broadway office condominium, 527 Madison Avenue and Tower 56. At December 31, 2007, we reduced the net carrying amount of the loans to $9,000,000 by recognizing a $57,000,000 non cash charge in our consolidated statement of income. On April 2, 2008, we sold a sub participation interest in the loans for $19,300,000, which resulted in the reduction of our valuation allowance from $57,000,000 to $46,700,000 and the recognition of $10,300,000 of non cash income in our consolidated statement of income. Dispositions On March 31, 2008, we sold our 47.6% interest in Americold, our Temperature Controlled Logistics segment, for $220,000,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $112,690,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest on our consolidated statement of income. On June 6, 2008, we sold our Tysons Dulles Plaza office building complex located in Tysons Corner, Virginia for approximately $152,800,000, in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $56,831,000, which is included as a component of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest on our consolidated statement of income. Pursuant to the sale of GMH Communities L.P. (GMH) military housing division and the merger of its student housing division with American Campus Communities, Inc (ACC) (NYSE: ACC), in June 2008 we received an aggregate of $105,180,000, consisting of $82,142,000 in cash and 753,126 shares of ACC common stock valued at $23,038,000 based on ACCs then closing share price of $30.59, in exchange for our entire interest in GMH. We subsequently sold all of the ACC common shares. The above transactions resulted in a net gain of $2,038,000, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2008, and is included as a component of net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate on our consolidated statement of income. The aggregate net income realized from inception of this investment in 2004 through its disposition was $77,000,000. Financings During 2008 we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level financings and repaid approximately $241,000,000 of existing debt with a portion of the proceeds. In addition, we purchased $81,540,000 (aggregate face amount) of our 4.50% senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2009, for $80,408,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $783,000. We also purchased $10,200,000 and $17,300,000 (aggregate face amounts) of our 3.63% and 2.85% convertible senior debentures, respectively, for an aggregate of $18,080,000 in cash, resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $9,037,000. These gains are included as a reduction of interest and debt expense on our consolidated statement of income. The net proceeds we received from the above dispositions and financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes. We may seek to obtain additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings or asset sales, although there is no express policy with respect to these capital markets transactions. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future. 70 Overview continued Leasing Activity The following table sets forth certain information for the properties we own directly or indirectly, including leasing activity.

(2) In addition, the New York Office segment leased 13,468 square feet of retail space during the year ended December 31, 2008 at an initial rent of $205.39, a 268% increase over the prior escalated rent per square foot. (3) Pursuant to SFAS 141, acquired below market leases are marked to market at the time of their acquisition. Accordingly, when the space is subsequently re leased, the cash basis rent increase is greater than the GAAP basis rent increase. 72 Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $15.709 billion and $15.226 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships) and acquired liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the propertys carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, our anticipated holding period for properties, or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. Identified Intangible Assets Upon an acquisition of a business we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill. We amortize identified intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives which are based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset, including the related real estate when appropriate, is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets, a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, were $525,950,000 and $563,359,000, respectively. In addition, the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets, were $719,822,000 and $814,098,000, respectively. If the intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, or the estimated useful lives of finite life intangibles assets or liabilities change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. 73 Critical Accounting Policies continued Mezzanine Loans Receivable We invest in mezzanine loans to entities which have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record investments in mezzanine loans at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were $472,539,000 and $492,339,000, respectively. We accrete or amortize any discounts or premiums over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method, or straight line method if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans, if circumstances warrant, in determining whether they are impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectibility of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amounts of investments and advances to partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1.083 billion and $1.505 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, if they occur, or receive the majority of the expected residual returns, if they occur, or both. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. Our investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned, and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Allowance For Doubtful Accounts We periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($32,834,000 and $19,151,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($5,773,000 and $3,076,000 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 74 Critical Accounting Policies continued Revenue Recognition We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rent income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Percentage Rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold. These rents are recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104: Revenue Recognition, which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenue income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Shows Revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences. 75 Recently Issued Accounting Literature In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective for our financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008. The FASB has deferred the implementation of the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to certain non financial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009. This standard did not materially affect how we determine fair value, but resulted in certain additional disclosures. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three levels: Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities; Level 2 observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets, but corroborated by market data; and Level 3 unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements primarily consist of (i) marketable securities, (ii) the assets of our deferred compensation plan (primarily marketable securities and equity investments in limited partnerships), for which there is a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (iii) Class A units of the Operating Partnership, held by third parties. Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2008 are presented in the table below based on their level in the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value Hierarchy(1) (Amounts in thousands) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Marketable securities $ 118,438 $ 118,438 $ $ Deferred compensation plan assets (included in other assets) 69,945 35,769 34,176 Interest rate caps (included in other assets) 25 25 Total Assets $ 188,408 $ 154,207 $ 25 $ 34,176 Class A units (included in minority interest) $ 882,740 $ $ 882,740 $ Deferred compensation plan liabilities $ 69,945 $ 35,769 $ $ 34,176 (1) We chose not to elect the fair value option prescribed by Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), for our financial assets and liabilities that had not been previously measured at fair value. These financial assets and liabilities include our outstanding debt, accounts receivable, accounts payable and investments in partially owned entities. The fair value of Level 3 deferred compensation plan assets represents equity investments in certain limited partnerships, for which there is a corresponding Level 3 liability to the plans participants. The following is a summary of changes in Level 3 deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, for the year ended December 31, 2008. (Amounts in thousands) Beginning Balance Total Realized/ Unrealized Losses Purchases, Sales, Other Settlements and Issuances, net Ending Balance For the year ended December 31, 2008 $ 50,578 $ (15,407 ) $ (995 ) $ 34,176 76 Recently Issued Accounting Literature continued In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 was effective on January 1, 2008. We did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R broadens the guidance of SFAS 141, extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 141R also broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and interests transferred as a result of business combinations; and acquisition related costs will generally be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition. SFAS 141R expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for all transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, in part because acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred compared to our current practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parents ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. As of December 31, 2008, as part of our preparation for the adoption of SFAS 160, which is effective for us on January 1, 2009, we have retroactively adopted the measurement provisions of EITF Topic D 98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. Upon adoption, we adjusted the carrying amounts of the Class A units held by third parties, a component of minority interest on our consolidated balance sheets, by recognizing a $639,447,000 increase to the January 1, 2006 balance of minority interest and a corresponding decrease in earnings in excess of (less than) distributions which ws accounted for a cumulative effect adjustment on January 1, 2006. Subsequent adjustments to the carrying amounts of the Class A units, to reflect their redemption value at the end of each reporting period, were recorded to additional capital. The adoption of SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009, will not result in the re classification of the carrying amounts of the Class A units held by third parties to a component within shareholders equity. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities, including disclosures regarding how an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and the impact of derivative instruments and related hedged items on an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 77 Recently Issued Accounting Literature continued In May 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), (the FSP), which is effective for us on January 1, 2009 and requires retroactive application. The adoption of this FSP will affect the accounting for our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D 13 convertible preferred units. The FSP requires the initial proceeds from the sale of our convertible and exchangeable senior debentures and Series D 13 convertible preferred units to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component. The resulting discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding as additional interest expense. The adoption of the FSP on January 1, 2009 will result in the recognition of an aggregate unamortized debt discount of $139,937,000 (as of December 31, 2008) in our consolidated balance sheets and additional interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Our current estimate of the incremental interest expense, net of minority interest, for each reporting period is as follows: (Amounts in thousands) For the year ended December 31: 2005 $ 3,401 2006 6,062 2007 28,191 2008 36,348 2009 37,379 2010 39,612 2011 40,587 2012 8,219 In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts (SFAS 163). SFAS 163 was issued to decrease inconsistencies within Statement No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises , and clarify how it applies to financial guarantee insurance contracts issued by insurance enterprises, including the recognition of premium revenue and claim liabilities. SFAS 163 also requires expanded disclosures about financial guarantee insurance contracts. SFAS 163 is effective on January 1, 2009. We believe that the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2009 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue 07 5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock (EITF 07 5). Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Companys own stock and (b) classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07 5 provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuers own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. EITF 07 5 is effective on January 1, 2009.

See notes on the following page. 81 Net income and EBITDA (1) by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 continued Notes to the preceding tabular information: (1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. Management considers EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the un levered performance of its segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, management utilizes this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of its assets to that of its peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) As of January 1, 2008, we transferred the operations and financial results related to 409 3rd Street, NW (Washington Office Center) from the Merchandise Mart segment to the Washington, DC Office segment for both the current and prior periods presented. (3) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of net income to EBITDA include our share of these items from partially owned entities.

(5) Primarily due to a $15,344 reduction from the mark to market of investments in our deferred compensation plan (for which there is a corresponding reduction in interest and other investment (loss) income, net), partially offset by a $4,600 pension termination cost, higher compensation expense and professional fees. 84 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to December 31, 2007 continued Income Applicable to Alexanders Our 32.5% share of income applicable to Alexanders (comprised of our share of Alexanders net income, management, leasing and development fees) was $36,671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $50,589,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $13,918,000. The decrease was primarily due to $6,583,000 of income for our share of the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense, compared to $14,280,000 in the prior year. Income (loss) Applicable to Toys Our 32.7% share of Toys financial results (comprised of our share of Toys net income, interest income on loans receivable, and management fees) for the years ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are for Toys fiscal periods from November 4, 2007 to November 1, 2008 and October 29, 2006 to November 3, 2007, respectively.

(2) As of November 13, 2008, our joint venture partners failure to contribute its pro rata share of required capital resulted in our ability under the joint venture agreement to assert unilateral control over major business decisions and accordingly, we began to consolidate our investment pursuant to Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Includes $4,100 for the reversal of a non cash charge recorded by the joint venture in prior periods which, pursuant to paragraph 19(n) of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18, The Equity Method of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock, should have been eliminated in the determination of our share of the earnings of the venture.

This decrease resulted primarily from: (Amounts in thousands) Derivative positions in marketable equity securities net loss of $33,740 in 2008 compared to a net gain of $113,503 in 2007 $ (147,243 ) Marketable equity securities impairment losses (76,352 ) MPH mezzanine loan income of $10,300 from the reversal of a portion of the 2007 loan loss accrual in 2008, compared to a $57,000 loan loss accrual in 2007 67,300 Decrease in interest income as a result of lower average yields on investments (2.3% in the current year compared to 5.0% in the prior year) (28,250 ) Decrease in interest income on mezzanine loans as a result of lower average investments ($480,558 in the current year compared to $611,943 in the prior year) (20,522 ) Decrease in income on investments in our deferred compensation plan (15,344 ) Other, net (8,696 ) $ (229,107 ) Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $586,358,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $569,386,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $16,972,000. This increase was primarily due to an $812 million increase in average outstanding debt from property financings and refinancings, partially offset by a $9,820,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt. Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $7,757,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $39,493,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007.

The decrease results primarily from a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the acquisition of H Street. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2008, we reversed the deferred tax liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of $222,174,000 in our consolidated statement of income.

(6) Primarily from a (i) $5,465 decrease in franchise taxes and donations, (ii) $4,420 decrease in medicare taxes resulting from stock option exercises and the termination of a rabbi trust, partially offset by, (iii) an $8,245 increase in stock based compensation. 91 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 continued Income Applicable to Alexanders Income applicable to Alexanders (loan interest income, management, leasing, development and commitment fees, and equity in income) was $50,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a loss of $14,530,000 for the prior year, an increase of $65,119,000. The increase was primarily due to (i) our $14,280,000 share of income in 2007 for the reversal of accrued stock appreciation rights compensation expense as compared to $49,043,000 for our share of expense in the prior year, (ii) an increase of $3,504,000 in our equity in earnings of Alexanders before stock appreciation rights and net gains on sales of condominiums, (iii) an increase of $3,758,000 in development fees in 2007, partially offset by (iv) our $4,580,000 share of Alexanders net gain on sale of 731 Lexington Avenue condominiums in the prior year and (v) a $1,305,000 decrease in leasing fee income.

In the year ended December 31, 2007, our loss applicable to Toys was $14,337,000, or $25,235,000 before our share of Toys income tax benefit, as compared to $47,520,000 or $70,147,000 before our share of Toys income tax benefit in the prior year. The decrease in our loss applicable to Toys before income tax benefit of $44,912,000 results primarily from (i) an increase in Toys net sales due to improvements in comparable store sales across all divisions and benefits in foreign currency translation, (ii) a net gain related to a lease termination, (iii) decreased interest expense primarily due to reduced borrowings and reduced amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by, (iv) an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which as a percentage of net sales were 27.7% and 26.4% for the twelve month periods ended November 3, 2007 and October 28, 2006, respectively, as a result of higher payroll, store occupancy, corporate and advertising expenses. 92 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 continued Income from Partially Owned Entities Summarized below are the components of income from partially owned entities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Equity in Net Income (Loss): (Amounts in thousands) For The Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 H Street non consolidated subsidiaries: 50% share of equity in income (1) $ 5,923 $ 11,074 Beverly Connection: 50% share of equity in net loss (7,031 ) (8,567 ) Interest and fee income 12,141 10,837 5,110 2,270 GMH Communities L.P: (2) 13.8% share in 2007 and 13.5% in 2006 of equity in net income (loss) 6,463 (1,013 ) Lexington MLP: (3) 7.5% in 2007 and 15.8% in 2006 share of equity in net income 2,211 34,459 Other (4) 12,184 13,565 $ 31,891 $ 60,355 (1) On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets and began to consolidate the accounts of these entities into our consolidated financial statements and no longer account for them under the equity method. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2006 these corporations were contesting our acquisition of H Street and impeded our access to their financial information. Accordingly, we were unable to record our pro rata share of their earnings. 2006 includes $3,890 for our 50% share of their earnings for the period from July 20, 2005 (date of acquisition) to December 31, 2005. (2) We recorded our pro rata share of GMHs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis because we filed our consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time that GCT filed its financial statements. On July 31, 2006 GCT filed its annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which restated the quarterly financial results of each of the first three quarters of 2005. On September 15, 2006 GCT filed its quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Accordingly, equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a net loss of $1,013, which consists of (i) a $94 net loss representing our share of GMHs 2005 fourth quarter results, including adjustments to restate its first three quarters of 2005 and (ii) a net loss of $919 for our share of GMHs earnings through September 30, 2006. (3) On January 1, 2007, we began recording our pro rata share of Lexington MLPs net income or loss on a one quarter lag basis because we file our consolidated financial statements on Form 10 K and 10 Q prior to the time that Lexington files its financial statements. Prior to the January 1, 2007, we recorded our pro rata share of Newkirk MLPs (Lexington MLPs predecessor) quarterly earnings current in our same quarter. Accordingly, our equity in net income or loss from partially owned entities for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes our share of Lexington MLPs net income or loss for the nine month period from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007. The decrease in our share of earnings from the prior year is primarily due to (i) 2007 including our share of Lexington MLPs first, second and third quarter results (lag basis) compared to 2006 including our share of Newkirk MLPs full year results, (ii) higher depreciation expense and amortization of above market lease intangibles in the current year as a result of Lexingtons purchase price accounting adjustments in connection with the merger of Newkirk MLP on December 31, 2006, (iii) $10,842 for our share of net gains on sale of real estate in 2006 and (iv) a $10,362 net gain recognized in 2006 as a result of the acquisition of Newkirk by Lexington. (4) Includes our equity in net earnings of partially owned entities, including partially owned office buildings in New York and Washington, DC, the Monmouth Mall, Dune Capital LP, Verde Group LLC, and others. 93 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 continued Interest and Other Investment Income Interest and other investment income (interest income on mezzanine loans receivable, other interest income and dividend income) was $226,425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $255,391,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $28,966,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the following: (Amounts in thousands) Decrease (increase) due to: Mezzanine loan loss accrual in 2007 $ 57,000 Higher average cash balances and marketable securities ($1,210,000 in 2007 compared to $526,000 in 2006) (51,939 ) McDonalds derivative net gain of $108,866 in 2007 compared to $138,815 in 2006 29,949 Sears Holding derivative net gain of $18,611 in 2006 18,611 GMH warrants derivative net loss of $16,370 in 2006 (16,370 ) Higher average mezzanine loans receivable ($612,000 in 2007 compared to $488,500 in 2006) (8,747 ) Other derivatives net gain of $4,682 in 2007 compared to $12,153 in 2006 7,471 Other, net (7,009 ) Total decrease in interest and other investment income $ 28,966 Interest and Debt Expense Interest and debt expense was $569,386,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $394,571,000 in the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $174,815,000. This increase was primarily due to (i) $80,255,000 from approximately $1.713 billion of mortgage financings and refinancings on our existing property portfolio during 2007 and 2006, (ii) $67,780,000 from a $1.754 billion of mortgage debt resulting from property acquisitions, (iii) $70,432,000 from senior unsecured financings, including $1.0 billion issued in November 2006 and $1.4 billion issued in March 2007, partially offset by, (iv) an increase of $28,240,000 in the amount of capitalized interest relating to a larger amount of assets under development in 2007, (v) $19,344,000 less interest in 2007 from the redemption of $500,000,000 of senior unsecured notes in May 2007, and (vi) $3,582,000 of expense in 2006 from early extinguishments of debt. Net Gains on Disposition of Wholly Owned and Partially Owned Assets other than Depreciable Real Estate Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets other than depreciable real estate was $39,493,000 and $76,073,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of net gains from sales of marketable equity securities, including $23,090,000 from the sale of McDonalds common shares in 2007 and $55,438,000 from the sale of Sears Canada common shares in 2006. Minority Interest of Partially Owned Entities Minority interest of partially owned entities was income of $3,494,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to income of $1,363,000 in the prior year, a change of $2,131,000. Minority interest of partially owned entities represents the minority partners pro rata share of the net income or loss of consolidated partially owned entities, including 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 555 California Street, India Property Fund, 220 Central Park South, Wasserman and the Springfield Mall. 94 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 continued Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $9,179,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $491,000 for the prior year, an increase of $8,688,000. This increase results primarily from (i) the consolidation of two H Street corporations beginning on April 30, 2007, the date we acquired the remaining 50% of these corporations we did not previously own (we previously accounted for our 50% investment on the equity method) and (ii) $4,622,000 of Federal withholding tax on dividends paid to foreign corporations in connection with 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street, which we acquired in May 2007. Discontinued Operations The combined results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include the operating results of Americold; Tysons Dulles Plaza; 19.6 acres of land we acquired as part of our acquisition of H Street, of which 11 acres were sold in September 2007; Vineland, New Jersey, which was sold on July 16, 2007; Crystal Mall Two, which was sold on August 9, 2007; Arlington Plaza, which was sold on October 17, 2007; 33 North Dearborn Street in Chicago, Illinois, which was sold on March 14, 2006; 424 Sixth Avenue in New York City, which was sold on March 13, 2006 and 1919 South Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia, which was sold on June 22, 2006.

This decrease results primarily from a lower minority ownership in the Operating Partnership due to the conversion of Class A Operating Partnership units into our common shares during 2007 and 2006. Perpetual Preferred Unit Distributions of the Operating Partnership Perpetual preferred unit distributions of the Operating Partnership were $19,274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21,848,000 for the prior year, a decrease of $2,574,000. This decrease resulted primarily from the redemption of $45,000,000 Series D 9 preferred units and the write off of $1,125,000 of Series D 9 issuance costs in October 2006. 95 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to December 31, 2006 continued EBITDA Below are the details of the changes in EBITDA by segment.

Same store operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarter by quarter net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations. The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we recorded on a one quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of its fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income.

Effective as of April 19, 2007, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mitchell Schear, the President of our Washington, DC Office segment. This agreement, which replaced his prior agreement, was approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Trustees and provides for a term of five years and is automatically renewable for one year terms thereafter. The agreement also provides for a minimum salary of $1,000,000 per year and bonuses and other customary benefits. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, on April 19, 2007, the Compensation Committee granted options to Mr. Schear to acquire 200,000 of our common shares at an exercise price of $119.94 per share. These options vest ratably over three years beginning in 2010 and accelerate on a change of control or if we terminate his employment without cause or by him for breach by us. The agreement also provides that if we terminate Mr. Schears employment without cause or by him for breach by us, he will receive a lump sum payment equal to one years salary and bonus, up to a maximum of $2,000,000. Transactions with Affiliates and Officers and Trustees Alexanders We own 32.5% of Alexanders. Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President, are officers and directors of Alexanders. We provide various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 6 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On September 9, 2008, Alexanders Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $7.00 per share, payable on October 30, 2008, to shareholders of record on October 14, 2008. The dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned 731 Lexington Avenue taxable REIT subsidiary into Alexanders. Accordingly, on October 30, we received $11,578,000, which was accounted for as a reduction of our investment in Alexanders. On September 15, 2008 and October 14, 2008, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who holds the same positions in Alexanders, exercised an aggregate of 200,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009, and received gross proceeds of $62,809,000. On March 13, 2007, Michael Fascitelli, our President, who also holds the same position in Alexanders, exercised 350,000 of his SARs, which were scheduled to expire on March 14, 2007, and he received gross proceeds of $50,465,000. Interstate Properties (Interstate) Interstate is a general partnership in which Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer, is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2008, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 8.8% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.0% of Alexanders common stock. We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on sixty days notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies that the management agreement terms are fair to us. We earned $803,000, $800,000 and $798,000 of management fees under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 101 Liquidity and Capital Resources We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development expenditures may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings. Acquisitions and Investments There were no material real estate acquisitions or investments in partially owned entities and mezzanine loans during 2008. During 2007, we completed approximately $4,045,400,000 of real estate acquisitions and $217,081,000 mezzanine loans. These acquisitions and investments were consummated through our subsidiaries and were financed with available cash, mortgage indebtedness, and or the issuance of operating partnership equity. The related assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Excluding our acquisition of a 70% interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street in May 2007, none of the acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were material to our historical consolidated financial statements. Details of our 2007 acquisitions and investments are summarized below. 100 West 33rd Street, New York City (the Manhattan Mall) On January 10, 2007, we acquired the Manhattan Mall for approximately $689,000,000 in cash. This mixed use property is located on the entire Sixth Avenue block front between 32nd and 33rd Streets in Manhattan and contains approximately 1,000,000 square feet, including 845,000 square feet of office space and 164,000 square feet of retail space. Included as part of the acquisition were 250,000 square feet of additional air rights. The property is adjacent to our Hotel Pennsylvania. Bruckner Plaza, Bronx, New York On January 11, 2007, we acquired the Bruckner Plaza shopping center, containing 386,000 square feet, for approximately $165,000,000 in cash. Also included as part of the acquisition was an adjacent parcel which is ground leased to a third party. The property is located on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx, New York. Filenes, Boston, Massachusetts On January 26, 2007, a joint venture in which we have a 50% interest, acquired the Filenes property located in the Downtown Crossing district of Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $100,000,000 in cash, of which our share was $50,000,000. H Street Building Corporation (H Street) In July 2005, we acquired H Street, which owns a 50% interest in real estate assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia and Washington, DC. On April 30, 2007, we acquired the corporations that own the remaining 50% interest in these assets for approximately $383,000,000, consisting of $322,000,000 in cash and $61,000,000 of existing mortgages. These assets include twin office buildings located in Washington, DC, containing 577,000 square feet, and assets located in Pentagon City, Virginia, comprised of 34 acres of land leased to three residential and retail operators, a 1,680 unit high rise apartment complex and 10 acres of vacant land. Further, we agreed to sell approximately 19.6 of the 34 acres of land to one of the existing ground lessees in two closings over a two year period for approximately $220,000,000. On May 11, 2007, we closed on the sale of 11 of the 19.6 acres for $104,000,000 and received $5,000,000 in cash and a $99,000,000 short term note. On September 28, 2007, the buyer pre paid the note in cash and we recognized a net gain of $4,803,000. Our total purchase price for 100% of the assets we will own, after the anticipated proceeds from the land sales, is $409,000,000, consisting of $286,000,000 in cash and $123,000,000 of existing mortgages. 102 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 555 California Street On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a 2,000,000 square foot Manhattan office building located on the block front between 51st and 52nd Street on Avenue of the Americas, and the three building 555 California Street complex (555 California Street) containing 1,800,000 square feet, known as the Bank of America Center, located at California and Montgomery Streets in San Franciscos financial district. The purchase price for our 70% interest in the real estate was approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.0 billion of cash and $797,000,000 of existing debt. Our share of the debt was comprised of $308,000,000 secured by 1290 Avenue of the Americas and $489,000,000 secured by 555 California Street. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. Shopping Center Portfolio Acquisition On June 26, 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of 15 shopping centers aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $351,000,000. The properties are located primarily in Northern New Jersey and Long Island, New York. We have completed the acquisition of nine of these properties for an aggregate purchase price of $250,478,000, consisting of $109,279,000 in cash, $49,599,000 in Vornado Realty L.P. preferred units, $12,460,000 of Vornado Realty L.P. common units and $79,140,000 of existing mortgage debt. We determined not to complete the acquisition of the remaining six properties and expensed $2,700,000 for costs of acquisitions not consummated on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. BNA Complex On August 9, 2007, we acquired a three building complex from The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (BNA) for $111,000,000 in cash. The complex contains approximately 300,000 square feet and is located in Washingtons West End between Georgetown and the Central Business District. We plan to convert two of these buildings to rental apartments. Simultaneously with the acquisition, we sold Crystal Mall Two, a 277,000 square foot office building located at 1801 South Bell Street in Crystal City, to BNA for $103,600,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $19,893,000. 103 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Certain Future Cash Requirements Development and Redevelopment Expenditures We are currently engaged in various development and redevelopment projects for which we have budgeted approximately $1.2 billion, of which $804.9 million has been expended as of December 31, 2008 and substantially all of the remainder is anticipated to be expended in 2009. Details of our development and redevelopment activities are summarized in Item 1. Business, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Other Capital Expenditures The following table summarizes other anticipated 2009 capital expenditures. (Amounts in millions except square foot date) Total New York Office Washington, DC Office Retail Merchandise Mart Other (1) Expenditures to maintain assets $ 78.0 $ 31.0 $ 31.0 $ 2.0 $ 5.0 $ 9.0 Tenant improvements 72.0 24.0 24.0 7.0 16.0 1.0 Leasing commissions 39.0 12.0 9.0 11.0 7.0 Total Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions 111.0 36.0 33.0 18.0 23.0 1.0 Per square foot $ 49.00 $ 15.00 $ 29.00 $ 15.00 (2) $ 42.00 Per square foot per annum $ 5.00 $ 3.00 $ 4.00 $ 2.00 (2) $ 6.00 Total Capital Expenditures and Leasing Commissions $ 189.0 $ 67.0 $ 64.0 $ 20.0 $ 28.0 $ 10.0 Square feet budgeted to be leased (in thousands) 740 2,200 630 1,500 Weighted average lease term 9.6 5.0 7.7 7.7 (1) Hotel Pennsylvania, Warehouses, 555 California Street and Wasserman. (2) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2009 leasing activity are $38.74 ($2.58 per annum) and $6.72 ($1.34 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively. The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of non consolidated entities, including Alexanders and Toys, as these entities will fund their own capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us. Dividends and Distributions On January 14, 2009, we declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.95 per common share, payable on March 12, 2009 in a combination of cash, not to exceed 40% in the aggregate, and Vornado common shares. This dividend policy, continued for all of 2009, will require approximately $260,000,000 of cash for common share dividends during 2009, assuming shareholder elections to receive cash meet or exceed the aggregate cash limitations. In addition, we expect to pay cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares during 2009 aggregating approximately $57,000,000. 104 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008. (Amounts in thousands) Contractual Cash Obligations (principal and interest(1)): Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Mortgages and Notes Payable $ 11,035,540 $ 823,834 $ 3,943,042 $ 2,432,379 $ 3,836,285 Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027 1,520,624 39,407 1,481,217 Convertible Senior Debentures due 2026 1,097,441 35,880 1,061,561 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2025 567,811 19,375 548,436 Revolving Credit Facilities 333,218 6,650 326,568 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 285,000 14,000 271,000 Purchase obligations, primarily construction commitments 237,830 237,830 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2010 219,000 9,500 209,500 Operating leases 202,957 13,304 23,509 23,408 142,736 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 176,041 176,041 Capital lease obligations 21,666 706 1,413 1,413 18,134 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $ 15,697,128 $ 1,376,527 $ 7,866,246 $ 2,457,200 $ 3,997,155 Commitments: Capital commitments to partially owned entities $ 213,352 $ 213,352 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 98 92 6 Total Commitments $ 213,450 $ 213,444 $ 6 $ $ (1) Interest on variable rate debt is computed using rates in effect at December 31, 2008. We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities though cash purchases and or exchanges for our equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such purchases and or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, and that as of December 31, 2008 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well known seasoned issuer. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants, that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 105 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations continued During 2008, we purchased an aggregate of $109,040,000 of our senior unsecured notes and convertible senior debentures, for $98,488,000 in cash. In addition, we completed approximately $1.3 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $241,000,000 of existing debt. During 2007, we completed approximately $1.4 billion of senior unsecured financings and $1.111 billion of property level mortgage financings and repaid $912,674,000 of existing debt. The net proceeds we received from 2008 and 2007 financings were used primarily for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions and investments unless otherwise noted. Details of our 2008 financing activities are summarized in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Details of our 2007 financing activities are summarized below. 2.85% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2027 On March 21, 2007, we sold $1.4 billion aggregate face amount of 2.85% convertible senior debentures due 2027, pursuant to an effective registration statement. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, after underwriters discounts and expenses, were approximately $1.37 billion. The debentures are redeemable at our option beginning in 2012 for the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase their debentures in 2012, 2017, and 2022 and in certain other limited circumstances. The debentures are convertible, under certain circumstances, for cash and Vornado common shares at an initial conversion rate of 6.1553 common shares per $1,000 of principal amount of debentures. The initial conversion price was $162.46, which represented a premium of 30% over the March 21, 2007 closing price for our common shares. The principal amount of debentures will be settled for cash and the amount in excess of the principal defined as the conversion value will be settled in cash or, at our election, Vornado common shares. The net proceeds of the offering were contributed to the Operating Partnership in the form of an inter company loan and the Operating Partnership guaranteed the payment of the debentures. Revolving Credit Facility On September 28, 2007, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $1.510 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which was increased by $85,000,000 on October 12, 2007 and can be increased to up to $2.0 billion during the initial term. The new facility has a three year term with two one year extension options, bears interest at LIBOR plus 55 basis points, based on our current credit ratings and requires the payment of an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. Together with the existing $0.965 billion credit facility, the Operating Partnership has an aggregate of $2.56 billion of unsecured revolving credit. Vornado is the guarantor of the Operating Partnerships obligations under both revolving credit agreements. The existing $0.965 billion credit facilitys financial covenants were modified to conform to the financial covenants under the new agreement. Significant modifications included (i) changing the definition of Capitalization Value to exclude corporate unallocated general and administrative expenses and to reducing the capitalization rate to 6.5% from 7.5%, and (ii) changing the definition of Total Outstanding Indebtedness to exclude indebtedness of unconsolidated joint ventures. Under the new agreement, Equity Value may not be less than Three Billion Dollars; Total Outstanding Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value; the ratio of Combined EBITDA to Fixed Charges, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.40 to 1.00; the ratio of Unencumbered Combined EBITDA to Unsecured Interest Expense, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not be less than 1.50 to 1.00; at any time, Unsecured Indebtedness may not exceed sixty percent (60%) of Capitalization Value of Unencumbered Assets; and the ratio of Secured Indebtedness to Capitalization Value, each measured as of the most recently ended calendar quarter, may not exceed fifty percent (50%). The new agreement also contains standard representations and warranties and other covenants. The terms in quotations in this paragraph are all defined in the new agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8 K dated September 28, 2007, filed on October 4, 2007. 106 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations continued Insurance We carry commercial liability and all risk property insurance ((i) fire, (ii) flood, (iii) extended coverage, (iv) acts of terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA) , which expires in December 2014, and (v) rental loss insurance) with respect to our assets. Our New York Office, Washington, DC Office, Retail and Merchandise Mart divisions have $2.0 billion of per occurrence all risk property insurance coverage, including terrorism coverage in effect through September 15, 2009. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, and a $150,000,000 annual aggregate. In June 2007 we formed Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (PPIC), a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, to act as a re insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for certified acts of terrorism and for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) acts, as defined by TRIPRA. Coverage for certified acts of terrorism is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Prior to the formation of PPIC, we were uninsured for NBCR losses. Subsequently, we have $2.0 billion of NBCR coverage under TRIPRA, for which PPIC is responsible for 15% of each NBCR loss and the insurance company deductible of $1,000,000. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties (which are generally non recourse to us), senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio. Other Commitments and Contingencies Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $213,352,000. Of this amount, $80,923,000 is committed to IPF and is pledged as collateral to IPFs lender. From time to time, we have disposed of substantial amounts of real estate to third parties for which, as to certain properties, we remain contingently liable for rent payments or mortgage indebtedness that we cannot quantify. 107 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Litigation We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC NJ) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to re allocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3, 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denying the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Courts decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Courts decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Courts decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. We are currently engaged in discovery and anticipate that a trial date will be set for some time in 2009. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. On May 24, 2007, we acquired a 70% controlling interest in 1290 Avenue of the Americas and the 555 California Street complex. Our 70% interest was acquired through the purchase of all of the shares of a group of foreign companies that own, through U.S. entities, the 1% sole general partnership interest and a 69% limited partnership interest in the partnerships that own the two properties. The remaining 30% limited partnership interest is owned by Donald J. Trump. In August 2005, Mr. Trump brought a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court against, among others, the general partners of the partnerships referred to above. Mr. Trumps claims arose out of a dispute over the sale price of and use of proceeds from, the sale of properties located on the former Penn Central rail yards between West 59th and 72nd Streets in Manhattan which were formerly owned by the partnerships. In decisions dated September 14, 2005 and July 24, 2006, the Court denied several of Mr. Trumps motions and ultimately dismissed all of Mr. Trumps claims, except for his claim seeking access to books and records. In a decision dated October 1, 2007, the Court determined that Mr. Trump had already received access to the books and records to which he was entitled, with the exception of certain documents which were subsequently delivered to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump sought re argument and renewal on, and filed a notice of appeal in connection with, his dismissed claims. In a decision dated January 6, 2009, the Court denied all of Mr. Trumps motions. Mr. Trump has filed a notice appealing the 2007 and 2009 decisions. In connection with the acquisition, we agreed to indemnify the sellers for liabilities and expenses arising out of Mr. Trumps claim that the general partners of the partnerships we acquired did not sell the rail yards at a fair price or could have sold the rail yards for a greater price and any other claims asserted in the legal action; provided however, that if Mr. Trump prevails on certain claims involving partnership matters, other than claims relating to sale price, the sellers will be required to reimburse us for certain costs related to those claims. We believe that the claims relating to the sale price are without merit. All other allegations are not asserted as a basis for damages and regardless of merit, in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows. In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (H Street) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants. In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee. In April 2007, we received letters from those tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P., claiming they had a right of first offer triggered by each of those transactions. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners. The claim alleges the right to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages. We believe this claim is without merit and in our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flow. 108 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Cash Flow for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs. Our cash and cash equivalents were $1,526,853,000 at December 31, 2008, a $372,258,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2007. This increase resulted from $817,812,000 of net cash provided by operating activities and $7,677,000 of net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by $453,231,000 of net cash used in investing activities. Property rental income represents our primary source of net cash provided by operating activities. Our consolidated outstanding debt was $12,649,086,000 at December 31, 2008, a $753,048,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2007. This increase resulted primarily from debt associated with property refinancings. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, $358,468,000 and $405,656,000, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. During 2009 and 2010, $453,530,000 and $1,096,941,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance such debt or choose to repay all or a portion, using existing cash balances or our revolving credit facilities. Our share of debt of unconsolidated subsidiaries was $3,196,585,000 at December 31, 2008, a $93,288,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2007.

NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excluding extraordinary items as defined under GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO and FFO per diluted share should be evaluated along with GAAP net income and income per diluted share (the most directly comparable GAAP measures), as well as cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, in evaluating the operating performance of equity REITs. Management believes that FFO and FFO per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, these non GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in Our Statements of Cash Flows. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 17. Income per Share, in our notes to consolidated financial statements on page 171 of this annual report on Form 10 K. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was $844,568,000, or $5.16 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $966,638,000 or $5.89 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007. FFO applicable to common shares plus assumed conversions was a negative $77,989,000 or $0.50 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to $193,412,000, or $1.18 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2007.

Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Effect of 1% Change In Base Rates December 31, Balance Weighted Average Interest Rate Consolidated debt: Variable rate $ 2,076,128 2.70% $ 20,761 $ 1,113,181 5.86% Fixed rate 10,572,958 5.19% 10,782,857 5.22% $ 12,649,086 4.78% 20,761 $ 11,896,038 5.28% Pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities (non recourse): Variable rate excluding Toys $ 282,752 3.63% 2,828 $ 193,655 6.74% Variable rate Toys 819,512 3.68% 8,195 1,072,431 7.14% Fixed rate (including $1,175,310 and $1,028,918 of Toys debt in 2008 and 2007) 2,094,321 6.51% 2,023,787 6.88% $ 3,196,585 5.53% 11,023 $ 3,289,873 6.96% Minority limited partners share of above (3,862 ) Total change in annual net income $ 27,922 Per share diluted $ 0.18 We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2008, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $462,000,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.75% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $462,000,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.93%. As of December 31, 2008, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $99,011,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. Fair Value of Our Debt The estimated fair value of our debt at December 31, 2008 was less than its aggregate carrying amount by approximately $1,177,806,000 based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which we believe similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. Derivative Instruments We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense. In 2008, we recognized a net loss of $33,740,000 and in 2007 and 2006 we recognized net gains aggregating approximately $113,503,000 and $153,208,000, respectively, from these positions. 116
