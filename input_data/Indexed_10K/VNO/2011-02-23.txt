Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.2% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2010. All references to we, us, our, the Company and Vornado refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our core operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexanders, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (Alexanders), which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments. Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) and the SNL REIT Index (SNL) for the following periods ended December 31, 2010: Total Return(1) Vornado RMS SNL One year 23.2% 28.5% 28.9% Three year 5.3% 2.5% 5.4% Five year 15.1% 13.5% 17.6% Ten year 255.7% 174.9% 191.1% (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future. We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value ; and Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors. Substantially all businesses, including ours, were negatively affected by the 2008/2009 economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the capital and financial markets. Although there are signs of an economic recovery and greater stability in the capital and financial markets, it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or any other trends on our financial results. 66 Overview continued Year Ended December 31, 2010 Financial Results Summary Net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $596,731,000, or $3.24 per diluted share, compared to $49,093,000, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009.

(the Fund) On July 6, 2010, we completed an initial closing of the Fund with aggregate equity commitments of $550,000,000, of which we committed $200,000,000. We expect to close on an additional $250,000,000 of equity commitments in the first quarter of 2011. We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it is our exclusive investment vehicle during the three year investment period for all investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters, including debt, equity and other interests in real estate, and excluding (i) investments in vacant land and ground up development; (ii) investments acquired by merger or primarily for our securities or properties; (iii) properties which can be combined with or relate to our existing properties; (iv) securities of commercial mortgage loan servicers and investments derived from any such investments; (v) noncontrolling interests in equity and debt securities; and (vi) investments located outside of North America. The Fund has a term of eight years. We consolidate the accounts of the Fund into our consolidated financial statements. In 2010, we incurred $6,482,000 for organization costs of the Fund, net of the Funds reimbursement to us, which are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of income. The Fund is accounted for under the AICPA Investment Company Guide and its investments are reported on its balance sheet at fair value, with changes in value each period recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the Fund received $146,789,000 of capital from partners, including $53,378,000 from us. During the second half of 2010, the Fund made four investments aggregating approximately $145,000,000 and reimbursed us for $1,500,000 of organization costs. Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (J.C. Penney) (NYSE: JCP) We own an economic interest in 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 9.9% of J.C. Penneys outstanding common shares. Below are the details of our investment. We own 18,584,010 common shares at an average price of $25.70 per share, or $477,678,000 in the aggregate. These shares, which have an aggregate fair value of $600,449,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in marketable equity securities on our consolidated balance sheet and are classified as available for sale. Of these shares, 15,500,000 were acquired through the exercise of a call option that originated on September 28, 2010 and settled on November 9, 2010. During the period in which the call option was outstanding and classified as a derivative instrument, we recognized $112,537,000 of income from the mark to market of the underlying common shares, which is included in interest and other investment income (loss), net on our consolidated statement of income. During the period from November 10 through December 31, 2010, we recognized $10,234,000 from the mark to market of the common shares classified as available for sale, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet). We also own an economic interest in 4,815,990 common shares through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.65 per share, or $137,989,000 in the aggregate. The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012. The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one years notice to us. The strike price per share increases at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points and decreases for dividends received on the shares. The contract is a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Mark to market adjustments on the underlying common shares are recognized in interest and other investment income (loss), net on our consolidated statement of income. During the period from October 7, 2010 through December 31, 2010, we recognized $17,616,000 of income from the mark to market of this position, based on J.C. Penneys closing share price of $32.31 at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate economic net gain on our investment in J.C. Penney was $140,387,000, based on J.C. Penneys closing share price of $32.31 per share and our weighted average cost of $26.31 per share. 69 Overview continued 2010 Acquisitions and Investments continued Investment in LNR Property Corporation (LNR) On July 29, 2010, as a part of LNRs recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000 mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNRs parent, Riley Holdco Corp. The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of $417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNRs total debt to $425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below. We account for our equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one quarter lag basis. LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary. The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us. Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNRs consolidated income statement. 510 Fifth Avenue On October 8, 2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000, comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt. We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. San Jose, California On October 15, 2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000 square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000, consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt. We consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of this acquisition. Atlantic City, New Jersey On November 4, 2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash. The land is leased to the partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December 2070. In January 2011, we completed a 10 year $60,000,000 financing of this land. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 5.14% and amortizes beginning in the third year, based on a 30 year schedule. 70 Overview continued 2010 Dispositions On October 20, 2010, we sold a 45% ownership interest in 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Warner Building) and 1101 17th Street, for $236,700,000, comprised of $91,000,000 in cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt. We retained the remaining 55% ownership interest and continue to manage and lease the properties. Based on the Warner Buildings implied fair value of $445,000,000, we recognized a net gain of $54,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The gain on 1101 17th Street, based on an implied fair value of $81,000,000, will be recognized when we monetize our investment. We share control over major decisions with our joint venture partner. Accordingly, these properties are accounted for under the equity method from the date of the sale. On January 12, 2011, we sold 1140 Connecticut Avenue and contracted to sell 1227 25th Street, subject to customary closing conditions, for an aggregate price of $127,000,000. We will retain net proceeds of approximately $107,000,000, after repaying an existing mortgage and recognize a net gain of approximately $44,000,000 in the first quarter of 2011. In March 2010, we ceased making debt service payments on the mortgage loan secured by the High Point Complex in North Carolina as a result of insufficient cash flow and the loan went into default. In November 2010, the property was placed in receivership. While the receivership process is inherently lengthy, we anticipate that the property will be sold in the first half of 2011, at which time the assets and liabilities will be removed from our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize a net gain of approximately $80,000,000. Accordingly, we have reclassified the results of operations of the property to (loss) income from discontinued operations, and the related assets and liabilities to assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 2010 Financing Activities On February 11, 2011, we completed a $425,000,000 refinancing of Two Penn Plaza, a 1.6 million square foot Manhattan office building. The seven year loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, which was swapped for the term of the loan to a fixed rate of 5.13%. The loan amortizes based on a 30 year schedule beginning in the fourth year. We retained net proceeds of approximately $139,000,000 after repaying the existing loan and closing costs. On February 10, 2011, we completed a $150,000,000 financing of 2121 Crystal Drive, a 506,000 square foot office building located in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. The 12 year fixed rate loan bears interest at 5.51% and amortizes based on a 30 year schedule beginning in third year. This property was previously unencumbered. On January 10, 2011, we completed a $75,000,000 financing of North Bergen (Tonnelle Avenue), a 410,000 square foot strip shopping center. The seven year fixed rate loan bears interest rate at 4.59%, provides for interest only payments during the first five years of the term and amortizes based on a 25 year schedule. This property was previously unencumbered. In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash. The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000. In a separate transaction, we acquired our partners interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000 in Operating Partnership units. These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt. In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10 year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization. The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers. The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10 year term and amortizes based on a 30 year schedule. The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor (2.36% at December 31, 2010). In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000. The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%. The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015. In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively. 71 Overview continued Leasing Activity The leasing activity presented below is based on leases signed during the period and is not intended to coincide with the commencement of rental revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

The new guidance requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including, but not limited to, significant purchases and sales of financing receivables, aging information and credit quality indicators. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, adding new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and additional disclosures about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 810, Consolidation, which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary, based on whether the entity has (i) power over the significant activities of the VIE, and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.9 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. As real estate is undergoing development activities, all property operating expenses, including interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the propertys carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be di fferent and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. 74 Critical Accounting Policies continued Identified Intangibles As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in place leases) were $348,745,000 and $439,549,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets, were $528,905,000 and $606,390,000, respectively. Identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair value, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indi cate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the identified intangible over its estimated fair value. If intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. Mezzanine Loans Receivable As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were $202,412,000 and $203,286,000, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $73,216,000 and $190,738,000, respectively. We invest in mezzanine loans of entities that have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight line method, if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or, as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Alexanders and Toys R Us, were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluat ion of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. 75 Critical Accounting Policies continued Allowance For Doubtful Accounts We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($62,979,000 and $46,708,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($7,323,000 and $4,672,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rent income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Percentage Rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenue income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Shows Revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences. 76 Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

tabular information: (1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize these measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of our net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities. (3) The components of Other EBITDA are summarized below. The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the other column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

Same store EBITDA excludes segment level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property level expenses, as well as other non operating items. We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight lining of rents, amortization of below market leases, net of above market leases and other non cash adjustments. We present these non GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.

(2) Primarily from lower REVPAR. (3) Primarily from lower exhibitor occupancy. (4) Primarily from the elimination of inter company fees from operating segments upon consolidation. See note (3) on page 88. (5) In December 2009, our agreement to sell an 8.6 acre parcel of land in the Pentagon City area of Arlington, Virginia, was terminated by the buyer.

(2) Primarily from a $8,190 decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes which are reimbursed by tenants. (3) Results primarily from an increase in the elimination of inter company fees of our operating segments upon consolidation. (4) Primarily from a lease modification that reduced the term of a portion of AXAs space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, which resulted in additional depreciation of approximately $16,000 in 2008. (5) On March 31, 2009, our nine most senior executives voluntarily surrendered their 2007 and 2008 stock option awards and their 2008 out performance plan awards. Accordingly, we recognized $32,588 of expense in the first quarter of 2009, representing the unamortized portion of these awards. (6) This increase in expense is entirely offset by a corresponding increase in income from the mark to market of the deferred compensation plan assets, a component of interest and other investment income (loss), net on our consolidated statement of income.

The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was the result of a $222,174,000 reversal of deferred taxes recorded in connection with our acquisition of H Street. We were required to record these deferred tax liabilities because H Street and its partially owned entities were operated as C Corporations at the time they were acquired. As of January 16, 2008, we had completed all of the actions necessary to enable these entities to elect REIT status effective for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2008 and reversed the deferred tax liabilities. 90 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to December 31, 2008 continued Income from Discontinued Operations The table below sets forth the combined results of operations of assets related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

See notes on the following page. 94 Supplemental Information continued Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 continued Notes to preceding tabular information: (1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize their measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities. (3) The tables below provide information about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the other column of the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations. The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the other column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

Same store EBITDA excludes segment level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property level expenses, as well as other non operating items. We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight lining of rents, amortization of below market leases, net of above market leases and other non cash adjustments. We present these non GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2009.

The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage rental income. Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010.

Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexanders. We provide various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On March 2, 2009, Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli each exercised 150,000 stock appreciation rights which were scheduled to expire on March 4, 2009 and each received gross proceeds of $11,419,000. Interstate Properties (Interstate) Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2010, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned approximately 7.0% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexanders common stock. We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days notice at the end of the term. We believe, based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. 98 Liquidity and Capital Resources We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions (excluding Fund acquisitions as described below) may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings. We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We have raised, and may continue to raise, capital for future Real Estate acquisitions through our real estate Fund. We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund and it is our exclusive investment vehicle for all investments that fit within the Funds investment parameters during its three year investment period. Acquisitions and Investments Details of 2010 acquisitions and investments are provided in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. There were no significant acquisitions or investments during 2009. Dispositions Details of 2010 dispositions are provided in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. On September 1, 2009, we sold 1999 K Street, a newly developed 250,000 square foot office building in Washingtons Central Business District, for $207,800,000 in cash, which resulted in a net gain of $41,211,000, which is included as a component of (loss) income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income. During 2009, we sold 15 retail properties in separate transactions for an aggregate of $55,000,000 in cash, which resulted in net gains aggregating $4,073,000, which is included as a component of (loss) income from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of income. Mezzanine Loans On January 28, 2010, we were repaid the entire $99,314,000 balance of the Equinox loan including accrued interest. This loan, which we acquired in 2006 for $57,500,000, was scheduled to mature in February 2013. On June 1, 2009, we were repaid the entire $41,758,000 balance of the Charles Square Hotel loan including accrued interest. This loan was scheduled to mature in September 2009. Financing Activities Details of 2010 financings are provided in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. In April 2009, we sold 17,250,000 common shares, including underwriters over allotment, in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement at an initial public offering price of $43.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $710,226,000, after underwriters discount and offering expenses and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 17,250,000 Class A units of the Operating Partnership. On September 30, 2009, we completed a public offering of $460,000,000 principal amount of 7.875% callable senior unsecured 30 year notes (NYSE: VNOD) due October 1, 2039. The notes were sold to the public at par and may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, beginning in October 2014 at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. We received net proceeds of approximately $446,000,000 from the offering which were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. During 2009, we purchased $1,912,724,000 (aggregate face amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $352,740,000 (aggregate face amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $1,877,510,000 and $343,694,000 in cash, respectively. This debt was acquired through tender offers and in the open market and has been retired. We also repaid $650,285,000 of existing property level debt and completed $277,000,000 of property level financings. In connection with the above, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $25,915,000 from the early extinguishment of debt on our consolidated statement of income. 99 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Certain Future Cash Requirements Development and Redevelopment Expenditures We expended $156,775,000 in 2010 to complete development projects. On October 1, 2010, Arlington County adopted a new Sector Plan for Crystal City that provides for additional density and increased building heights which would permit us to grow our assets in Crystal City from 8.0 million square feet currently to as much as 11.5 million square feet. During 2010, we entered into agreements with Cuyahoga County, Ohio (the County) to develop and operate the Cleveland Medical Mart and Convention Center (the Facility), a 1,000,000 square foot showroom, trade show and conference center in Clevelands central business district. The County will fund the development of the Facility, using proceeds from the issuance of general obligation bonds and other sources, up to the development budget of $465,000,000 and maintain effective control of the property. During the 17 year development and operating period, we will receive net settled payments of approximately $10,000,000 per year, which is net of our $36,000,000 annual obligation to the County. Our obligation has been pledged by the County to the bondholders, but is payable by us only to the extent that we first receive at least an equal payment from the County. We engaged a contractor to construct the Facility pursuant to a guaranteed maximum price contract. Although we are ultimately responsible for cost overruns, the contractor is responsible for all costs incurred in excess of its contract and has provided a completion guaranty. Construction of the Facility is expected to be completed in 2013. Subsequent thereto, we are required to fund $11,500,000, primarily for tenant improvements, are responsible for all operating expenses and are entitled to the net operating income, if any, of the Facility. The County may terminate the operating agreement five years from the completion of development and periodically thereafter, if we fail to achieve certain performance thresholds. We plan to account for these agreements using criteria set forth in ASC 605 25, Multiple Element Arrangements, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management related services over the 17 year term. We plan to recognize development fees using the percentage of completion method of accounting. We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities for which final plans, budgeted costs and financing have yet to be determined. These projects include the Springfield Mall in Springfield, Virginia and the Hotel Pennsylvania and 220 Central Park South in Manhattan. There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget. 100 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Other Capital Expenditures The following table summarizes other anticipated 2011 capital expenditures.

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of each of our partially owned non consolidated subsidiaries, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us. 101 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Dividends On January 12, 2011, we increased our quarterly common dividend to $0.69 per common share (an indicated annual rate of $2.76 per common share. This dividend policy, if continued for all of 2011, would require us to pay out approximately $507,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2011, we expect to pay approximately $57,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $53,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership. Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations We believe that we have complied with the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes and that as of December 31, 2010 we have the ability to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity securities and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well known seasoned issuer. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal.

Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $150,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $150,000,000 annual aggregate. Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (PPIC), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) acts, as defined by TRIPRA. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Our coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio. Other Commitments and Contingencies Our mortgage loans are non recourse to us. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $263,178,000. At December 31, 2010, $12,198,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. We are committed to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $199,953,000, of which $146,622,000 is committed to our real estate Fund. In addition, we have agreed in principle to contribute up to $52,000,000 to a new investment management fund which will be managed by LNR. As part of the process of obtaining the required approvals to demolish and develop our 220 Central Park South property into a new residential tower, we have committed to fund the estimated project cost of approximately $400,000,000 to $425,000,000. 103 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Litigation We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matters referred to below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On January 8, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a complaint with the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (USDC NJ) claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect the $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to the Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the East Brunswick, Jersey City, Middletown, Union and Woodbridge leases to which the $5,000,000 of additional rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that a prior order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York dated February 6, 2001, as modified on appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 13, 2001, froze our right to reallocate which effectively terminated our right to collect the additional rent from Stop & Shop. On March 3 , 2003, after we moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, Stop & Shop voluntarily withdrew its complaint. On March 26, 2003, Stop & Shop filed a new complaint in New York State Supreme Court, asserting substantially the same claims as in its USDC NJ complaint. We removed the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In January 2005 that court remanded the action to the New York State Supreme Court. On February 14, 2005, we served an answer in which we asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid additional rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the additional rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. On May 17, 2005, we filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 15, 2005, Stop & Shop opposed our motion and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. On December 13, 2005, the Court issued its decision denyin g the motions for summary judgment. Both parties appealed the Courts decision and on December 14, 2006, the Appellate Court division issued a decision affirming the Courts decision. On January 16, 2007, we filed a motion for the reconsideration of one aspect of the Appellate Courts decision which was denied on March 13, 2007. Discovery is complete and a trial was held in November 2010, with closing arguments expected in March 2011. We intend to continue to vigorously pursue our claims against Stop & Shop. In July 2005, we acquired H Street Building Corporation (H Street) which has a subsidiary that owns, among other things, a 50% tenancy in common interest in land located in Arlington County, Virginia, known as "Pentagon Row," leased to two tenants, Street Retail, Inc. and Post Apartment Homes, L.P. In April 2007, H Street acquired the remaining 50% interest in that fee. On September 25, 2008, both tenants filed suit against us and the former owners claiming the right of first offer to purchase the fee interest, damages in excess of $75,000,000 and punitive damages. In April 2010, the Trial Court entered judgment in favor of the tenants, that we sell the land to the tenants for a net sales price of $14,992,000, representing the Trial Courts allocation of our purchase price for H Street. The request for damages and punitive damages was denied. As a result of the Trial Courts decision, we recorded a $10,056,000 loss accrual in the first quarter of 2010. We filed a motion to appeal the Trial Courts decision, which the appeals court refused to hear. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we sold the property to the tenants for $14,992,000 in cash (our reduced carrying amount) and reclassified the results of operations of this property to (loss) income from discontinued operations, and the related assets and liabilities to assets related to discontinued operations and liabilities related to discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 104 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, distributions to common and preferred shareholders, as well as acquisition and development costs. Our cash and cash equivalents were $690,789,000 at December 31, 2010, a $155,310,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily due to cash flows from operating activities as discussed below, partially offset by our investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Our consolidated outstanding debt was $10,893,639,000 at December 31, 2010, a $207,936,000 increase over the balance at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, $874,000,000 and $852,218,000, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. During 2011 and 2012, $2,070,534,000 and $2,102,531,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it.

Recurring capital improvements include expenditures to maintain a propertys competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to re lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing leases.

NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 16 Income per Share, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements on page 156 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $1,149,781,000, or $6.05 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $583,596,000 or $3.36 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $335,759,000 or $1.76 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to $20,000, or $0.00 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2009. Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary of our Overview.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 Weighted Effect of 1% Weighted December 31, Average Change In December 31, Average Consolidated debt: Balance Interest Rate Base Rates Balance Interest Rate Variable rate $ 2,903,510 1.76% $ 29,035 $ 2,657,972 1.67% Fixed rate 7,990,129 5.66% 8,027,731 5.87% $ 10,893,639 4.62% 29,035 $ 10,685,703 4.83% Pro rata share of debt of non consolidated entities (non recourse): Variable rate excluding Toys $ 345,308 1.39% 3,453 $ 331,980 2.87% Variable rate Toys 501,623 4.95% 5,016 852,040 3.45% Fixed rate (including $1,421,820 and $1,077,919 of Toys debt in 2010 and 2009) 2,428,986 (1) 6.86% 1,965,620 7.16% $ 3,275,917 5.99% 8,469 $ 3,149,640 5.70% Redeemable noncontrolling interests share of above (2,682) Total change in annual net income $ 34,822 Per share diluted $ 0.19 (1) Excludes $37 billion for our 26.2% pro rata shares of liabilities related to consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts which are non recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us. We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2010, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $564,707,181 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.84% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $558,844,181 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.68%. As of December 31, 2010, we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of $138,434,000 that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $11,190,189,000. Derivative Instruments We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, including our economic interest in J.C. Penney common shares. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income (loss), net on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense in any given period. During the year ended December 31, 2010 we recognized $130,153,000 of income from derivative instruments. 112
