Accordingly, Vornados cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.5% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2011. All references to we, us, our, the Company and Vornado refer to Vornado Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. We own and operate office, retail and showroom properties (our core operations) with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area and in the Washington, DC / Northern Virginia area. In addition, we have a 32.7% interest in Toys R Us, Inc. (Toys) which has a significant real estate component, a 32.4% interest in Alexanders, Inc. (NYSE: ALX) (Alexanders), which has seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and related investments. Our business objective is to maximize shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing our performance to the Morgan Stanley REIT Index (RMS) and the SNL REIT Index (SNL) for the following periods ended December 31, 2011: Total Return(1) Vornado RMS SNL One year (4.6%) 8.7% 8.3% Three year 40.2% 79.6% 79.9% Five year (25.2%) (7.3%) (3.9%) Ten year 187.0% 163.2% 175.4% (1) Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance. We intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through: Maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit; Investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City and Washington, DC, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation; Acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents; Investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area; Developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and Investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component. We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future. We compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments than we are. Principal factors of competition include rents charged, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. See Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors. 67 Overview continued Year Ended December 31, 2011 Financial Results Summary Net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $601,771,000, or $3.23 per diluted share, compared to $596,731,000, or $3.24 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010.

In addition, 2010 included a $10,056,000 litigation loss accrual. Adjusting for these items, 2011 EBITDA was lower than the prior year by $3,679,000, or 0.8%. Same Store EBITDA was higher than the prior year by 0.9% (see page 90 for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Same Store EBITDA). We estimate that occupancy will decrease from 90% at December 31, 2011, to between 82% to 84% in 2012 and that 2012 EBITDA will be lower than 2011 by approximately $55,000,000 to $65,000,000, based on 2,902,000 square feet expiring in 2012, partially offset by leasing over 1,000,000 square feet. A significant portion of the vacancy is related to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute. We estimate it will take approximately two to three years to fully absorb this vacancy and for EBITDA to recover. The table below summarizes the effect of BRAC on our Washington, DC Office Properties segment for square feet leased by the DOD.

Based on the projected vacancy and the significant amount of capital, time and effort to re tenant the property, we requested that the mortgage loan be placed with the special servicer. 76 Recently Issued Accounting Literature In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Update No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS (ASU No. 2011 04). ASU No. 2011 04 provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and requires additional disclosures, including: (i) quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, for Level 3 fair value measurements; (ii) fair value of financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, based on their levels in the fair value hierarchy; and (iii) transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU No. 2011 04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this update on January 1, 2012 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU No. 2011 05). ASU No. 2011 05 requires the presentation of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011 05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2011, and has presented the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a separate financial statement. In September 2011, the FASB issued Update No. 2011 09, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Disclosures About an Employers Participation in a Multiemployer Plan (ASU No. 2011 09). ASU No. 2011 09 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys participation in multiemployer plans that offer pension and other postretirement benefits. ASU No. 2011 09 became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this update on December 31, 2011 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Real Estate Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation, were $14.5 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components. If we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate, depreciation expense may be misstated. As real estate is undergoing development activities, all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to, the development and construction of a project, including interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property. The capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends when the project is substantially complete. General and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known trends and market/economic conditions. Our properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the propertys carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. 77 Critical Accounting Policies continued Identified Intangibles As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in place leases) were $319,704,000 and $346,157,000, respectively. The carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets, were $467,187,000 and $521,372,000, respectively. Identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair value, separate and apart from goodwill. Identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the identified intangible over its estimated fair value. If intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material. Mezzanine Loans Receivable As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were $133,948,000 and $202,412,000, respectively. We invest in mezzanine loans of entities that have significant real estate assets. These investments, which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property, are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate. We record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium. We accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight line method, if the result is not materially different. We evaluate the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable. A loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If our estimates of the collectability of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Partially Owned Entities As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities, including Toys R Us, was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. In determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider factors such as ownership interest, board representation, management representation, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity. We account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method. Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. 78 Critical Accounting Policies continued Allowance For Doubtful Accounts We periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts ($43,241,000 and $62,979,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010) for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements. We also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents ($4,046,000 and $7,316,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively). This receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements. Management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies: Base Rent income arising from tenant leases. These rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases. We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. In addition, in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant, we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Percentage Rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds. These rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed (i.e., when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved). Hotel Revenue income arising from the operation of the Hotel Pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Income is recognized when rooms are occupied. Food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered. Trade Shows Revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows, including rentals of booths. This revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred. Expense Reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred. Management, Leasing and Other Fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements. Cleveland Medical Mart revenue arising from the development of the Cleveland Medical Mart. This revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in ASC 605 25, Multiple Element Arrangements, as we are providing development, marketing, leasing, and other property management services. Before we recognize revenue, we assess, among other things, its collectibility. If our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material. Income Taxes We operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) under Sections 856 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. We distribute to our shareholders 100% of our taxable income. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders, or fail to meet other REIT requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences. 79 Net Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (Amounts in thousands) For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 New York Washington, DC Merchandise

December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 continued Notes to preceding tabular information: (1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize these measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax (benefit) expense in the reconciliation of our net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities. (3) The tables below provide information about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the other column of the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations. The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the other column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight lining of rents, amortization of below market leases, net of above market leases and other non cash adjustments. We present these non GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Income and EBITDA by Segment for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 continued Notes to preceding tabular information: (1) EBITDA represents Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. We consider EBITDA a supplemental measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on a multiple of EBITDA, we utilize their measures to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. (2) Interest and debt expense, depreciation and amortization and income tax expense in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA includes our share of these items from partially owned entities. (3) The tables below provide information about EBITDA from certain investments that are included in the other column of the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations. The totals for each of the columns below agree to the total EBITDA for the other column in the preceding EBITDA by segment reconciliations.

Same store EBITDA excludes segment level overhead expenses, which are expenses that we do not consider to be property level expenses, as well as other non operating items. We present same store EBITDA on both a GAAP basis and a cash basis, which excludes income from the straight lining of rents, amortization of below market leases, net of above market leases and other non cash adjustments. We present these non GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers. Same store EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010.

The business of Toys is highly seasonal. Historically, Toys fourth quarter net income, which we record on a one quarter lag basis in our first quarter, accounts for more than 80% of Toys fiscal year net income. The Office and Merchandise Mart segments have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. The Merchandise Mart segment also has experienced higher earnings in the second and fourth quarters of the year due to major trade shows occurring in those quarters. The Retail segment revenue in the fourth quarter is typically higher due to the recognition of percentage and specialty rental income. Below are the same store EBITDA results on a GAAP and cash basis for each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2011.

Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board, and Michael D. Fascitelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, are officers and directors of Alexanders. We provide various services to Alexanders in accordance with management, development and leasing agreements. These agreements are described in Note 5 Investments in Partially Owned Entities to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Interstate Properties (Interstate) Interstate is a general partnership in which Mr. Roth is the managing general partner. David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr., Trustees of Vornado and Directors of Alexanders, are Interstates two other partners. As of December 31, 2011, Interstate and its partners beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 6.3% of the common shares of beneficial interest of Vornado and 27.2% of Alexanders common stock. We manage and lease the real estate assets of Interstate pursuant to a management agreement for which we receive an annual fee equal to 4% of annual base rent and percentage rent. The management agreement has a term of one year and is automatically renewable unless terminated by either of the parties on 60 days notice at the end of the term. We believe based upon comparable fees charged by other real estate companies, that the management agreement terms are fair to us. Other Upon maturity on December 23, 2011, Steven Roth, the Chairman of our Board of Trustees, repaid the Company his $13,122,500 outstanding loan. Pursuant to a credit agreement dated November 1999, Mr. Roth may draw up to $15,000,000 of loans from the Company on a revolving basis. Each loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at the applicable Federal rate on the date the loan is made and matures on the sixth anniversary of such loan. Loans are collateralized by assets with a value of not less than two times the amount outstanding. On December 23, 2011, Mr. Roth borrowed $13,122,500 under this facility, which bears interest at 1.27% per annum and matures on December 23, 2017. 103 Liquidity and Capital Resources Property rental income is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, and our revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions (excluding Fund acquisitions) may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings. In addition, the Fund has aggregate unfunded equity commitments of $416,600,000 for acquisitions, including $104,150,000 from us. Dividends Our dividend policy, if continued for all of 2012, would require us to pay out approximately $510,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2012, we expect to pay approximately $71,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $49,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership. Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a well known seasoned issuer. Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, we had $606,553,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,339,915,000 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $138,000,000 and letters of credit of $22,085,000. A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is presented below. 2011 2010 (Amounts in thousands) Weighted Weighted December 31, Average December 31, Average Consolidated debt: Balance Interest Rate Balance Interest Rate Variable rate $ 2,206,993 2.25% $ 2,903,510 1.76% Fixed rate 8,355,009 5.55% 7,985,932 5.66% $ 10,562,002 4.86% $ 10,889,442 4.62% During 2012 and 2013, $1,292,886,000 and $1,714,664,000, respectively, of our outstanding debt matures.

Details of 2011 financing activities are provided in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2010 financing activities are discussed below. In March 2010, we completed a public offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due April 1, 2015 and retained net proceeds of approximately $496,000,000. The notes were sold at 99.834% of their face amount to yield 4.287%. The notes can be redeemed without penalty beginning January 1, 2015. In August 2010, we sold $660,000,000 of 10 year mortgage notes in a single issuer securitization. The notes are comprised of a $600,000,000 fixed rate component and a $60,000,000 variable rate component and are cross collateralized by 40 of our strip shopping centers. The $600,000,000 fixed rate portion bears interest at an initial rate of 4.18% and a weighted average rate of 4.31% over the 10 year term and amortizes based on a 30 year schedule. The variable rate portion bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.36%, with a 1% floor. In December 2010, we acquired the mortgage loan secured by the Springfield Mall, located in Fairfax County, Virginia for $115,000,000 in cash. The loan had an outstanding balance of $171,500,000. In a separate transaction, we acquired the prior owners interest in the partnership that owns the mall in exchange for $25,000,000 in Operating Partnership units. These transactions resulted in a $102,932,000 net gain on early extinguishment of debt. In 2010, through open market repurchases and tender offers, we purchased $270,491,000 aggregate face amount ($264,476,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our convertible senior debentures and $17,000,000 aggregate face amount ($16,981,000 aggregate carrying amount) of our senior unsecured notes for $274,857,000 and $17,382,000 in cash, respectively, resulting in a net loss of $10,381,000 and $401,000, respectively. 105 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Acquisitions and Investments Details of 2011 acquisitions and investments are provided in the Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. Details of 2010 acquisitions and investments are discussed below. Investment in LNR Property Corporation (LNR) On July 29, 2010, as a part of LNRs recapitalization, we acquired a 26.2% equity interest in LNR for $116,000,000 in cash and conversion into equity of our $15,000,000 mezzanine loan (the then current carrying amount) made to LNRs parent, Riley Holdco Corp. The recapitalization involved an infusion of a total of $417,000,000 in new cash equity and the reduction of LNRs total debt to $425,000,000 from $1.3 billion, excluding liabilities related to the consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts described below. We account for our equity interest in LNR under the equity method on a one quarter lag basis. LNR consolidates certain commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) trusts for which it is the primary beneficiary. The assets of these trusts (primarily commercial mortgage loans), which aggregate approximately $142 billion as of September 30, 2010, are the sole source of repayment of the related liabilities, which are non recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us. Changes in the fair value of these assets each period are offset by changes in the fair value of the related liabilities through LNRs consolidated income statement. 510 Fifth Avenue On October 8, 2010, we acquired 510 Fifth Avenue, a 59,000 square foot retail property located at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York, for $57,000,000, comprised of $24,700,000 in cash and $32,300,000 of existing debt. We consolidate the accounts of this property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. San Jose, California On October 15, 2010, we acquired the 55% interest that we did not already own of a 646,000 square foot retail property located in San Jose, California, for $97,000,000, consisting of $27,000,000 in cash and $70,000,000 of existing debt. We consolidate the accounts of the property into our consolidated financial statements from the date of this acquisition. Atlantic City, New Jersey On November 4, 2010, we acquired 11.3 acres of the land under a portion of the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex for $83,000,000 in cash. The land is leased to the partnership that controls the Borgata Hotel and Casino complex through December 2070. Investment in J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (J.C. Penney) (NYSE: JCP) We own 23,400,000 J.C. Penney common shares, or 11.0% of J.C. Penneys outstanding common shares. Of these shares, 4,815,990 are owned through a forward contract executed on October 7, 2010, at a weighted average strike price of $28.80 per share, or $138,682,000 in the aggregate. The contract may be settled, at our election, in cash or common shares, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 9, 2012. The counterparty may accelerate settlement, in whole or in part, upon one years notice to us. 106 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Certain Future Cash Requirements Capital Expenditures The following table summarizes other anticipated 2012 capital expenditures. New York Washington, DC Merchandise (Amounts in millions, except square foot data) Total Office Office Retail Mart Other (1) Expenditures to maintain assets $ 72.0 $ 33.0 $ 20.0 $ 5.0 $ 6.0 $ 8.0 Tenant improvements 114.0 45.0 36.0 21.0 11.0 1.0 Leasing commissions 32.0 15.0 8.0 6.0 3.0 Total capital expenditures and leasing commissions $ 218.0 $ 93.0 $ 64.0 $ 32.0 $ 20.0 $ 9.0 Square feet budgeted to be leased (in thousands) 1,200 1,300 2,000 300 Weighted average lease term (years) 10 5 7 9 Tenant improvements and leasing commissions: Per square foot $ 50.00 $ 34.00 $ 13.50 $ 46.50 (2) Per square foot per annum $ 5.00 $ 6.51 $ 1.83 $ 5.41 (2) (1) Primarily 555 California Street, Hotel Pennsylvania and Warehouses. (2) Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot budgeted for 2012 leasing activity are $76.00 ($7.00 per annum) and $25.00 ($4.50 per annum) for Merchandise Mart office and showroom space, respectively. The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of each of our partially owned non consolidated subsidiaries, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us. Development and Redevelopment Expenditures We expended $25,100,000 in 2011 to complete development projects in progress. We are evaluating various development and redevelopment opportunities which we estimate could require as much as $1.5 billion to be expended over the next five years. These opportunities include: demolition of a 372,000 square foot office building in Crystal City, to construct a 700,000 square foot office building; renovation of the Hotel Pennsylvania; construction of a luxury residential condominium at 220 Central Park South, adjacent to Central Park; re tenanting and repositioning of 330 West 34th Street; re tenanting and repositioning of 280 Park Avenue; complete renovation of the 1.4 million square foot Springfield Mall; and re tenanting and repositioning a number of our strip shopping centers. We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan, Rosslyn, Pentagon City and Crystal City, for which plans, budgeted costs and financings have yet to be determined. There can be no assurance that any of our development projects will commence, or if commenced, be completed on schedule or within budget. 107 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Insurance We maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, including coverage for terrorist acts, with sub limits for certain perils such as floods. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $180,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property, up to a $180,000,000 annual aggregate. Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (PPIC), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re insurer with respect to all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism, including nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) acts, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. Coverage for NBCR losses is up to $2.0 billion per occurrence, for which PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $3,200,000 and 15% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining 85% of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss borne by PPIC. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties which are non recourse to us, senior unsecured notes, exchangeable senior debentures, convertible senior debentures and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance our properties and expand our portfolio. Other Commitments and Contingencies Our mortgage loans are non recourse to us. However, in certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $283,625,000. At December 31, 2011, $22,085,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities. Our credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. We expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $288,799,000. 108 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Litigation We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters, including the matter referred to below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In 2003, Stop & Shop filed an action against us in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that we had no right to reallocate and therefore continue to collect $5,000,000 of annual rent from Stop & Shop pursuant to a Master Agreement and Guaranty, because of the expiration of the leases to which the annual rent was previously allocated. Stop & Shop asserted that an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, as modified on appeal by the District Court, froze our right to reallocate and effectively terminated our right to collect the annual rent from Stop & Shop. We asserted a counterclaim seeking a judgment for all the unpaid annual rent accruing through the date of the judgment and a declaration that Stop & Shop will continue to be liable for the annual rent as long as any of the leases subject to the Master Agreement and Guaranty remain in effect. After summary judgment motions by both sides were denied, the parties conducted discovery. A trial was held in November 2010. On November 7, 2011, the Court determined that we have a continuing right to allocate the annual rent to unexpired leases covered by the Master Agreement and Guaranty, and directed entry of a judgment in our favor ordering Stop & Shop to pay us the unpaid annual rent accrued through February 28, 2011 in the amount of $37,422,000, a portion of the annual rent due from March 1, 2011 through the date of judgment, interest, and attorneys fees. On December 16, 2011, a money judgment based on the Courts decision was entered in our favor in the amount of $56,597,000 (including interest and costs). The amount for attorneys fees is being addressed in a proceeding before a special referee. Stop & Shop has appealed the Courts decision and the judgment, and has posted a bond to secure payment of the judgment. On January 12, 2012, we commenced a new action against Stop & Shop seeking recovery of $2,500,000 of annual rent not included in the money judgment, plus additional annual rent as it accrues. As of December 31, 2011, we have a $41,983,000 receivable from Stop and Shop, excluding amounts due to us for interest and costs resulting from the Courts judgment. In the fourth quarter of 2011, based on the Courts decision, we recognized $23,521,000 of income, representing the portion of the $41,983,000 receivable that was previously reserved. As a result of Stop & Shops appeal, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the maximum reasonably possible loss is up to the total amount of the receivable of $41,983,000. 109 Liquidity and Capital Resources continued Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Our cash and cash equivalents were $606,553,000 at December 31, 2011, a $84,236,000 decrease over the balance at December 31, 2010. Our consolidated outstanding debt was $10,562,002,000 at December 31, 2011, a $327,440,000 decrease over the balance at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $138,000,000 and $874,000,000, respectively, was outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. During 2012 and 2013, $1,292,886,000 and $1,714,664,000 of our outstanding debt matures, respectively. We may refinance our maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it.

Recurring capital improvements include expenditures to maintain a propertys competitive position within the market and tenant improvements and leasing commissions necessary to re lease expiring leases or renew or extend existing leases. Non recurring capital improvements include expenditures to lease space that has been vacant for more than nine months and expenditures completed in the year of acquisition and the following two years that were planned at the time of acquisition, as well as tenant improvements and leasing commissions for space that was vacant at the time of acquisition of a property.

In the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, NAREIT issued updated guidance on FFO and modified its definition of FFO to specifically exclude real estate impairment losses, including the prorata share of such losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. To the extent applicable, NAREIT requested companies to restate prior period FFO to conform to the new definition. Accordingly, we have restated our quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 FFO to exclude real estate impairment losses aggregating $103,981,000 and $108,981,000, respectively. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, extraordinary items and other specified non cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $1,230,973,000, or $6.42 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1,251,533,000, or $6.59 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010. FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions was $280,369,000, or $1.46 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2011, compared to $432,860,000, or $2.27 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2010. Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financial results summary of our Overview.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non trading activity) is as follows: (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 Weighted Effect of 1% Weighted December 31, Average Change In December 31, Average Consolidated debt: Balance Interest Rate Base Rates Balance Interest Rate Variable rate $ 2,206,993 2.25% $ 22,070 $ 2,903,510 1.76% Fixed rate 8,355,009 5.55% 7,985,932 5.66% $ 10,562,002 4.86% 22,070 $ 10,889,442 4.62% Prorata share of debt of non consolidated entities (non recourse): Variable rate excluding Toys $ 284,372 2.85% 2,844 $ 345,308 1.39% Variable rate Toys 706,301 4.83% 7,063 501,623 4.95% Fixed rate (including $1,270,029 and $1,421,820 of Toys debt in 2011 and 2010) 3,208,472 (1) 6.96% 2,428,986 6.86% $ 4,199,145 6.32% 9,907 $ 3,275,917 5.99% Redeemable noncontrolling interests share of above (2,079) Total change in annual net income $ 29,898 Per share diluted $ 0.16 (1) Excludes $33.3 billion for our 26.2% pro rata share of LNRs liabilities related to consolidated CMBS and CDO trusts which are non recourse to LNR and its equity holders, including us. We may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. As of December 31, 2011, variable rate debt with an aggregate principal amount of $443,353,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.40% was subject to LIBOR caps. These caps are based on a notional amount of $443,353,000 and cap LIBOR at a weighted average rate of 5.58%. In addition, we have one interest rate swap on a $425,000,000 loan that swapped the rate from LIBOR plus 2.00% (2.30% at December 31, 2011) to a fixed rate of 5.13% for the remaining seven year term of the loan. As of December 31, 2011, we have investments in mezzanine loans at variable interest rates with an aggregate carrying amount of $54,724,000 and a weighted average rate of 10.42%, which partially mitigates our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $10,770,227,000. Derivative Instruments We have, and may in the future enter into, derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, including our economic interest in J.C. Penney common shares. Because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income (loss), net on our consolidated statements of income. In addition, we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over LIBOR. Because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense in any given period. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized income from derivative instruments of $12,984,000 and $130,153,000, respectively. 117
