Overview VeriSign, Inc. is a leading provider of critical infrastructure services that enable Web site owners, enterprises, communications service providers, electronic commerce, or e commerce, service providers and individuals to engage in secure digital commerce and communications. In 2003, our business consisted of three reportable segments: the Internet Services Group, the Communications Services Group and the Network Solutions domain name registrar business. The economic environment during the first half of 2003 was challenging across all segments of our business, but began to improve in certain sectors during the third and fourth quarters. As the year progressed, we noted improved IT spending in the United States, Europe and Japan and saw a general rebound in e commerce globally. These developments led to a return to growth in revenues and deferred revenues in our Internet Services Groups security services, payment services and naming and directory services businesses. These trends were offset, however, by a continued deterioration in market share in our Network Solutions domain name registrar business due to ongoing competition from other accredited registrars. Further, the telecommunications industry had another difficult year due to an excess of capacity which resulted in increased pricing pressures for our Communications Services Groups offerings and increased rates of business consolidation in the sector. Many second tier carriers continued to have financial difficulties and several telecommunications customers filed for bankruptcy during 2003. We were also unable to renew our contract with Dobson, a sizable wireless billing customer, due to its affiliation with another telecommunications provider utilizing a competitive system. We derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan. In the Internet Services Group, more than 70% of the revenues during 2003 were derived from the sale of web certificates, payment services, managed PKI services and registry services. In the Communications Services Group, over 75% of our revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services, billing services, SS7 connectivity and signaling services during 2003. As for our Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which we sold in late 2003, virtually all revenues for this business unit were derived from the sale of our domain name registration services. During 2004, we expect to see continued, modest improvements in the level of IT and telecommunications spending and e commerce activity in the United States, Europe and Japan. For the year, we anticipate a decline in VeriSigns overall revenues due to the sale of our Network Solutions business, with moderate growth in revenues in the Internet Services Group and flat to moderate growth in revenues in the Communications Services Group. 35 Table of Contents Network Solutions Sale On November 25, 2003, we completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business to Pivotal Private Equity. We received approximately $98 million of consideration, consisting of approximately $58 million in cash and a $40 million senior subordinated note that bears interest at 7% per annum for the first three years, 9% per annum thereafter and matures five years from the date of closing. The principal and interest are due upon maturity. This note is subordinated to a term loan made by ABLECO Finance to the Network Solutions business in the principal amount of approximately $40 million as of the closing date. We retained a 15% equity stake in the Network Solutions business. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future and accordingly, we expect the sale of the business will result in a decline in pro forma and U.S. GAAP net revenues of between $140 and $160 million in 2004 compared to 2003, and will reduce pro forma operating profits between $12 and $20 million and U.S. GAAP operating losses between $90 million and $98 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The Network Solutions business provides domain name registrations, and value added services such as business e mail, websites, hosting and other web presence services. Approximately 580 former VeriSign employees are now employed by the Network Solutions business as a result of the transaction. In connection with the sale, we assigned the lease for our facility located in Drums, Pennsylvania to the purchaser and subleased certain facilities located in Herndon, Virginia to the purchaser. VeriSign Japan K.K. initial public offering In the fourth quarter of 2003, VeriSigns majority owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K., completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Approximately $37.4 million was raised by VeriSign Japan K.K. from the initial public offering and through subsequent option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2003. VeriSign Japan K.K.s shares began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on November 19, 2003 under the company code 3722. Acquisitions In October 2003, we completed our acquisition of UNC Embratel, the clearinghouse division of Embratel, for approximately $16 million. UNC Embratel provides call record tracking, clearing and settlement services for a majority of the mobile and fixed telecommunications carriers in Brazil. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. The results of UNC Embratels operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition. In February 2002, we completed our acquisition of H.O. Systems, Inc., a provider of billing and customer care solutions to wireless carriers. We paid approximately $350 million in cash for all of the outstanding stock of H.O. Systems. The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date. H.O. Systems results of operations were included in the consolidated financial statements from its date of acquisition. We accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2003, 2002 and 2001 as purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the acquired companies revenues, costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition. Additionally, the results of operations of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business have been excluded from our consolidated results of operations since we finalized the sale of the business on November 25, 2003. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business in 2003, our acquisitions of H.O. Systems in February 2002 and Illuminet Holdings in December 2001, comparisons of revenues, costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 to the years ended December 31, 2002, and 2001 may not be relevant, as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent. 36 Table of Contents Subsequent events On February 26, 2004, we successfully completed our acquisition of Guardent, a leading privately held provider of managed security services. We paid approximately $135 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Guardent, of which approximately $65 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign stock. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction. Prior to the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business, VeriSign and Network Solutions were defendants in numerous lawsuits related to customer disputes over domain name registrations and related services. From January 1, 2004 through March 8, 2004, VeriSign resolved six lawsuits directly related to the Network Solutions business totaling approximately $10 million. This amount has been included in sale of business and litigation settlements on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long lived assets, and deferred taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition During 2003, VeriSign derived its revenues from three reportable segments: (i) the Internet Services Group, which consists of the Security Services business and the Naming and Directory Services business. The Security Services business provides products and services that enable enterprises and organizations to establish and deliver secure Internet based services to customer and business partners, and the Naming and Directory Services business acts as the exclusive registry of domain names in the .com and .net generic top level domains, or gTLDs, and certain country code top level domains, or ccTLDs; (ii) the Communications Services Group, which provides Signaling System 7, or SS7, network services, intelligent data base and directory services, application services and billing and payment services to wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers; and (iii) domain name registration services through the Network Solutions business segment, which VeriSign sold in November 2003. VeriSigns revenue recognition policies are in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, unless otherwise noted below. The revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows: Internet Services Revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate, generally 12 months. Revenues from the sale of managed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license, generally 12 to 36 months. Post contract customer support (PCS) is bundled with managed PKI services licenses and recognized over the license term. 37 Table of Contents Revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including PCS, training and other services. These licenses, which do not provide for right of return, are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met. We recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to VeriSign Affiliates in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98 9, when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectibility is probable. We define each of these four criteria as follows: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. It is our customary practice to have a written contract, which is signed by both the customer and us, or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us. Delivery has occurred. Our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer. Electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an FTP server. If an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product, delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered. The fee is fixed or determinable. It is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of their paid license fees. We may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs. Generally, at least 80% of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable, and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable. Collectibility is probable. Collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis. We typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection. New customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process, revenues are recognized as cash is collected. During 2003, revenues for all VeriSign Affiliates represented approximately 2% of consolidated revenues. Our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. We limit our assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenues to PCS and professional services components of our perpetual license arrangements. We sell our professional services separately, and have established VSOE on this basis. VSOE for PCS is determined based upon the customers annual renewal rates for these elements. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with SOP 98 9. Our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software. Our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration. Customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed, but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services. Software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services, which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis. 38 Table of Contents Revenues from consulting services are recognized using either the percentage of completion method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed. Percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from training are recognized as training is performed. Revenues from managed security services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the managed security service. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, revenues from set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned. Revenues from the monthly service fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided. Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with SAB No. 101, as amended by SAB No. 104, unless otherwise noted. Revenues from third party product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer. Our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer. Revenues from payment services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services. Revenues from set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned. Revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided. Advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided. Communications Services Revenues from communications services are comprised of network connectivity, intelligent network services, wireless billing and customer care services and clearinghouse services. Network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our SS7 network and trunk signaling services. Revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees, and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals. Intelligent network services, which include calling card validation, local number portability, wireless services, toll free database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a per use or per query basis. Revenues from prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by us and recognized in the period in which such calls are processed on a per minute or per call basis. Revenues from wireless billing and customer care services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by our wireless carrier customers. Clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another. Clearinghouse services revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed. Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amounts due from customers that are related to our telecommunications services for third party network access, data base charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer. Domain Name Registration Services Domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services. Revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term, generally one to two years and up to ten years. 39 Table of Contents Domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on renewal and collection rates. Customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance, and we record the receivables and related deferred revenue for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of our domain name registration agreements. The variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of renewal rates for prospective periods. Fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences. These fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term, ranging from one to ten years. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customers expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. We also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer, industry or geographic region. To date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that, if not collected, would have a significant impact on our operating income. We require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. As of December 31, 2003, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 14% of total accounts receivable. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to approximately $1 million. Valuation of long lived intangible assets including goodwill Our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We review long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the assets carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset. Recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $618 million at December 31, 2003, which was comprised of $401 million of goodwill and $217 million of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, and customer lists. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, 40 Table of Contents the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill. Based on these measurements, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $123 million and $4,611 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, the agreement we entered into to sell our Network Solutions business triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of Network Solutions goodwill. As a result we recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of approximately $30 million in the third quarter of 2003. Restructuring In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. The plan resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and equipment and other charges. As a result of the 2003 restructuring plan, and in conformity with SFAS No. 146 and SFAS No. 112, we incurred restructuring and other charges amounting to approximately $54.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources. This restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, write off of abandoned property and equipment and other charges. As a result of this plan, in conformity with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 100 and EITF Issues No. 94 3 and 88 10, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $20.5 million during 2003 and $88.6 million during 2002. Deferred Taxes We account for deferred taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets, we considered such factors as our history of operating losses, our uncertainty as to the projected long term operating results, and the nature of our deferred tax assets. Although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods, our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence. The possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations. To the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions, the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit. Results of Operations We had net losses for fiscal 2003 of approximately $260 million, a decrease of $4,701 million compared to our losses in fiscal 2002. Our net losses were due primarily to the charges we have incurred for the amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions and restructuring charges. The reduction in net losses for 2003 compared to 2002 is the result primarily of a decrease in the amounts amortized and impaired. A comparison of the amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets amortized and impaired and restructuring charges in 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Goodwill and other intangible assets $ 335,505 $ 4,894,714 $ 13,569,653 Restructuring $ 74,633 $ 88,574 $ 41 Table of Contents Partially offsetting the reduction in amounts amortized and impaired was a decline in revenues of $166.9 million, or 14%, for 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in revenues principally reflects declining revenues of approximately $99.4 million, or 32%, from the Network Solutions domain name registrar business and approximately $88.5 million, or 17%, from our Internet Services Group for 2003 compared to 2002. These revenue declines were partially offset by an increase of revenues of approximately $21.0 million, or 5%, from our Communications Services Group for 2003 compared to 2002. As of December 31, 2003, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $21.7 billion, primarily due to the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $22.0 billion related to our acquisitions. Amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately $58.4 million in 2004, including the impact of all acquisitions through December 31, 2003, and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges. The following is a discussion of revenues for each of VeriSigns segments: Revenues In 2003, we had three reportable segments: Internet Services Group, Communications Services Group and Network Solutions. A comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Internet Services Group $ 436,216 (17 )% $ 524,765 4 % $ 504,946 Communications Services Group 406,745 5 % 385,734 3,217 % 11,629 Network Solutions 211,819 (32 )% 311,169 (33 )% 466,989 Total revenues $ 1,054,780 (14 )% $ 1,221,668 24 % $ 983,564 Total revenues decreased 14% in 2003, compared to 2002, due to a 32% decrease in Network Solutions revenues and a 17% decrease in Internet Services Group revenues partially offset by a 5% increase in Communications Services Group revenues. Total revenues increased 24% in 2002, compared to 2001, consisting of a 3,217% increase in Communications Services Group revenues and a 4% increase in Internet Services Group revenue partially offset by 33% decrease in Network Solutions revenues. Internet Services Group Internet Services Group revenues decreased $89 million, or 17% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decline in Security Services revenues of approximately $123 million resulting from the discontinuation of third party product sales and related consulting and support services and a decline in revenues from VeriSign Affiliates of $19 million. The decreases in revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues of $10 million for payment services, an increase in PKI and SSL certificate revenues of $23 million and an increase in Naming and Directory Services revenues of $21 million. At the end of 2003, Naming and Directory Services, as the exclusive registry of domain names within the .com and .net gTLDs and certain ccTLDs, had an active base of approximately 30.4 million domain names under management, compared to approximately 25.8 million names at the end of 2002. Revenues for our Internet Services Group increased slightly in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to growth in the number of online merchants using our payment services and growth in the total number of domain names under management by our registry services. 42 Table of Contents The following table shows a comparison of the approximate installed base of Web site digital certificates at the end of each of the last three years: December 31, 2003 % Change December 31, 2002 %Change December 31, 2001 Installed base of Web site digital certificates 384,000 (2 )% 392,000 7 % 366,000 The following table shows a comparison of total domain names under management ending in .com and .net by our Naming and Directory Services business and the approximate number of active online merchants in our payment services business at the end of each of the last three years: December 31, 2003 %Change December 31, 2002 %Change December 31, 2001 Domain names under management ending in .com and .net 30.4 million 18 % 25.8 million (2 )% 26.3 million Active online merchants 102,000 23 % 83,000 36 % 61,000 Communications Services Group Communications Services Group revenues increased $21.0 million, or 5%, in 2003, as compared to 2002 as a result of an increase in billing and payment services revenues of $18.2 million and an increase in SS7 signaling and connectivity revenues of $1.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in caller name revenues of $2.2 million. At the end of 2003, we had 1,177 communications services customers compared to 1,035 customers at the end of 2002. Communications Services Group revenues increased $374 million in 2002, as compared to 2001 primarily due to our acquisitions of Illuminet Holdings in December 2001, and H.O. Systems in February 2002. The following table shows a comparison of the approximate number of daily database queries and the number of communications services customers as of the end of each year presented: December 31, 2003 %Change December 31, 2002 %Change December 31, 2001 Daily database queries 8.6 billion 16 % 7.4 billion 19 % 6.2 billion Communications services customers 1,177 14 % 1,035 7 % 966 Network Solutions Network Solutions revenues declined $99 million, or 32%, in 2003 compared to 2002 principally due to weaker demand for new domain name registrations and a decline in total domain names under management. Active domain names under management were approximately 8.2 million names as of November 25, 2003, the date we sold Network Solutions, compared to 9.3 million at December 31, 2002. In addition, the revenue decline reflects the completion of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003 which resulted in 329 days of consolidated revenues for 2003 compared to a full year in 2002. The sale of Network Solutions on November 25, 2003 is estimated to have represented approximately $15 to $20 million of the $99 million decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future and accordingly, we expect the sale of the business will result in a decline in pro forma and U.S. GAAP net revenues of between $140 and $160 million in 2004 compared to 2003, and will reduce pro forma operating profits between $12 and $20 million and U.S. GAAP operating losses between $90 million and $98 million in 2004 compared to 2003. In 2001, Network Solutions experienced a decrease in the number of new names and the non renewal of names paid for, which contributed to a decline in deferred revenue in 2002 as compared to 2001, resulting in a decrease in revenues recognized in 2002, as compared to 2001. 43 Table of Contents International revenues Revenues from our international subsidiaries increased $24.0 million, or 41% in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to increased web certificate and managed PKI sales in Europe and Asia. Revenues from our VeriSign Affiliates decreased $19.1 million, or 47% in 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to a decline in the number of new licensing agreements entered into with, and in royalty payments received from, VeriSign Affiliates. Our direct international sales primarily consist of direct sales to international communication services customers. In 2003, we began transitioning our international strategy in certain larger European markets to move from a distribution model through our VeriSign Affiliates to a direct distribution model through our international subsidiaries. The result was an increase in web certificates sold internationally in 2003 compared to 2002. Revenues from our international subsidiaries increased $19.9 million, or 51% in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to web certificate and managed PKI services growth in Europe and Asia. Revenues from VeriSign Affiliates decreased $42.7 million, or 51% in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a decline in new licensing agreements resulting in lower royalty revenues. On a percentage basis, revenues from our international subsidiaries accounted for 8% of total revenues in 2003, 5% in 2002, and 4% in 2001. Revenues from our VeriSign Affiliates accounted for 2% of total revenues in 2003, 3% in 2002, and 8% in 2001. Revenues from direct international sales accounted for 1% of total revenues in 2003, 1% in 2002 and less than 1% in 2001. The increase in revenues from international subsidiaries on a percentage basis in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the decline in revenues for the Network Solutions registrar business and to the disposition of the business in November 2003 as Network Solutions revenues were attributed to the United States because it is impracticable to determine the country of origin for domain name registration revenues. The decrease in revenues from VeriSign Affiliates on a percentage basis in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the decline in VeriSign Affiliate revenues from $40.2 million in 2002 to $21.2 million in 2003. The percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and VeriSign Affiliates in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Illuminet Holdings in December 2001 and H.O. Systems in February 2002 whose revenues are derived principally from customers located in the United States. Additionally, a decline in the number of new licensing agreements entered into with, and royalty payments received from, VeriSign Affiliates resulted in a decrease in international revenues in 2002 of $42.7 million partially offset by increased in revenues from international subsidiaries of $19.9 million and an increase in direct international sales of $6.9 million. The following table shows a comparison of our international revenues as of the end of each year presented: 2003 %Change 2002 % Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) International subsidiaries $ 82,731 41 % $ 58,709 51 % $ 38,793 VeriSign Affiliates 21,156 (47 )% 40,228 (51 )% 82,899 Direct international sales 8,980 28 % 7,000 4,865 % 141 Total international revenues $ 112,867 7 % $ 105,937 (13 )% $ 121,833 Percent of total revenues 11 % 9 % 12 % As a result of our decision to transition our international strategy in certain larger markets in Europe from a distribution model through the VeriSign Affiliates to a direct distribution model through its international subsidiaries, and as a result of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business whose revenues were attributed to the United States, we expect international revenues will increase to 12% to 15% of total revenues in 2004. 44 Table of Contents Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased by $4,740 million, or 79%, to $1,283 million during fiscal 2003 compared with the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the charges we incurred for the amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Amortization and impairment charges totaled approximately $336 million in 2003 compared to $4,895 million in 2002. Also contributing to the decline in operating expenses were decreases in cost of revenues of $125.2 million, sales and marketing expenses of $52.8 million and restructuring and other charges of $13.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002. We announced plans to restructure our business in April of 2002 and again in October of 2003. As a result of these restructuring plans, and as a result of the sale of our Network Solutions business, we have experienced a significant reduction in overall costs in 2003 compared to 2002, including a reduction in labor and benefit costs. The following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function as of the end of each year presented: December 31, 2003 %Change December 31, 2002 %Change December 31, 2001 Employee headcount: Cost of revenues 1,136 (24 )% 1,500 10 % 1,366 Sales and marketing 552 (20 )% 693 (25 )% 924 Research and development 269 (32 )% 398 18 % 337 General and administrative 514 (15 )% 602 (7 )% 644 Total 2,471 (23 )% 3,193 (2 )% 3,271 Excluding the effects of any future acquisitions or dispositions, we expect our employee headcount to increase slightly in 2004 across all business units and corporate services. As a result of our acquisition of Guardent, Inc., which closed on February 26, 2004, we added approximately 160 employees to our employee headcount. The sale of our Network Solutions business in November 2003 resulted in a headcount reduction in cost of revenues of 436 employees, sales and marketing of 87 employees, and general and administrative of 54 employees for a total of reduction of 577 employees. Cost of revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services, payment services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP based networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities. In addition, with respect to our digital certificate services, cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants identities, insurance premiums for our service warranty plan, errors and omission insurance and the cost of software and hardware resold to customers. A comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 446,207 (22 )% $ 571,367 66 % $ 343,721 Percentage of revenues 42 % 47 % 35 % 45 Table of Contents On an absolute dollar basis cost of revenues decreased $125.2 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The primary reason for this decrease was due to our transition out of the third party product reseller and the third party product training businesses. This transition accounted for a decrease of approximately $105.9 million. Also, labor and benefits costs decreased approximately $9.6 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to a reduction in employee headcount related to our restructuring plans announced in 2002 and 2003. Contract and professional services fees declined approximately $12.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to a discontinuation in 2003 of certain outsourced customer service centers for our Network Solutions registrar business. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased modestly during 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to our transition out of the third party product reseller and the third party product training businesses, which typically have higher costs and lower margins than our internal products and services. Additionally, fixed labor and benefit costs declined as a result of the reduction in employee headcount in 2003 relating to our restructuring plans. Growth of revenues was the primary factor in the increase of cost of revenues on an absolute dollar basis in 2002 as compared to 2001. We acquired Illuminet Holdings in December 2001 and H.O. Systems in February 2002, which added significant cost of revenues during 2002. We incurred increased expenses for access to third party databases to verify digital certificate applicants identities, increased customer service costs related to our larger customer base and increased expenses related to the cost of hardware and software products resold to customers as part of our consulting business. Registry fees, third party fees, other direct costs, and labor are our largest expense categories for cost of revenues. The acquisition of Illuminet Holdings resulted in an increase in labor expenses of $35.4 million in 2002 and an increase of $124.5 million for third party fees and other direct costs. Additionally, depreciation expenses in cost of revenues increased due to the Illuminet acquisition by $31.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. While overall our cost of revenues increased, we reduced outside consulting costs by $10.4 million in 2002 from 2001 due to a company wide cost reduction effort. Future acquisitions, further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products may result in additional increases in cost of revenues, due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased significantly during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from our Illuminet Holdings acquisition and due to over 10 months of activity from our H.O. Systems acquisition. Our communications services businesses have different cost structures than our other businesses resulting in an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues since their acquisitions. Certain of our services, such as consulting and training, require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services. In addition, revenues derived from our authentication services, domain name registration services, registry services, payment services, and our communications services each have different cost structures and our overall cost of revenues may fluctuate as these businesses mature. We anticipate that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will decrease modestly in 2004 due to the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business whose cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was generally higher than our other businesses. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs. 46 Table of Contents A comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 195,330 (21 )% $ 248,170 (4 )% $ 259,585 Percentage of revenues 19 % 20 % 26 % Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $52.8 million on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a reduction in advertising and marketing spending and a reduction in labor and benefit costs. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased approximately $22.5 million in 2003 due to a significant reduction in Network Solutions marketing campaigns during 2003. Labor and benefits costs decreased approximately $19.8 million in 2003 related to a reduction in employee headcount associated with our restructuring plans. Additionally, contract and professional services expenses decreased approximately $6.6 million due to an overall reduction in sales and marketing service contracts in 2003. Travel expenses decreased approximately $1.8 million in 2003 due to reduced employee headcount and an overall decrease in international travel as a result of safety concerns stemming from health and terrorism alerts. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses declined slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in advertising and marketing spending in 2003 compared to 2002. Sales and marketing expenses decreased on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to a substantial reduction in expenditures for advertising and related promotional activities, particularly with respect to Network Solutions, and from a decrease in allocated lease expenses. Advertising and related promotional expenditures declined by over $44.7 million due to a heightened effort to control spending in conjunction with our restructuring plan announced in April 2002. In an effort to decrease the use of external vendors for sales and marketing efforts, we increased our internal labor expenses during 2002. This increase partially offsets the savings noted above. The decrease in allocated lease expenses is a result of our purchase of our headquarters complex in Mountain View, California in October of 2001. On an absolute dollar basis, our acquisitions of Illuminet Holdings and H.O. Systems in December 2001 and February 2002, respectively, partially offset the decrease in spending for advertising and related promotional activities and allocated lease expenses during 2002. These acquisitions resulted in an additional $12.1 million of sales and marketing labor expenses for 2002 as compared to 2001. Additionally, we incurred increased depreciation expense during 2002 compared to 2001 due to the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002. We have continued to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues over the three year period presented. This is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers, which tend to have lower retention costs, the restructuring plans we have put into place in 2003 and 2002, the sale of our Network Solutions business in 2003 and an increase in productivity of our direct and inside sales forces. In 2004 we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease on an absolute dollar basis and to remain unchanged on a percentage of revenues basis as a result of the sale of our Network Solutions business. Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development. 47 Table of Contents A comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 55,806 15 % $ 48,353 (38 )% $ 78,134 Percentage of revenues 5 % 4 % 8 % Research and development expenses increased slightly in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. The absolute dollar increase of approximately $7.5 million was primarily a result of increased spending of approximately $3.6 million in the Communications Services Group. Additionally, the Naming and Directory Services Group had increased equipment, software and depreciation expenses related to the development of new products and services of approximately $2.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2003 compared to 2002 and due to a decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. Research and development expenses decreased in 2002 from 2001 in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. The absolute dollar decrease is related to a substantial decrease in allocated lease expenses resulting from our purchase of our headquarters complex in Mountain View, California in October 2001, and from benefits realized as a result of our restructuring plan. Additionally, during 2001, we incurred overall higher expenses for the design, testing and deployment of our security service offerings as compared to 2002. We believe that timely development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and on a percentage of revenues basis in the future. To date, we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred. General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, facilities, and computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense. A comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) General and administrative $ 168,380 (2 )% $ 172,123 20 % $ 143,297 Percentage of revenues 16 % 14 % 15 % General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.7 million on an absolute dollar basis in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in bad debt expense partially offset by increases in contract and professional services, higher labor and benefit costs, increased depreciation expenses and additional legal expenses. Bad debt expense decreased approximately $36.7 million in 2003 due to increased focus on collection activities. 48 Table of Contents The following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 and our days sales outstanding (DSO) as of the end of the years presented: 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Bad debt expense $ 6,055 (86 )% $ 42,712 59 % $ 26,910 DSO 34 days (18 ) days 52 days (22 ) days 74 days We expect DSO will be in the 40 to 50 day range throughout 2004. The expected increase results from the sale of the Network Solutions business whose DSO was lower than our other business units. The decrease in general and administrative costs in 2003 was partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately $7.4 million as a result of defending various lawsuits, particularly lawsuits related to the Network Solutions business, and contract and professional services of approximately $6.1 million primarily due to the development of a companywide strategic planning methodology, tax services and increased expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Additionally, depreciation increased $5.9 million as a result of capital expenditures to upgrade our business systems and labor and benefits increased approximately $5.8 million due to higher benefit costs. Also, we incurred increased occupancy expenses of approximately $2.1 million in 2003 due to the expansion of a facility in Virginia and increases in business insurance, licenses and property taxes of $3.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased in 2003 due primarily to the decrease in revenues in 2003 compared to 2002. General and administrative expenses increased in 2002 from 2001 on an absolute dollar basis primarily due to our acquisitions of Illuminet Holdings and H.O. Systems in December 2001 and February 2002, respectively. These acquisitions resulted in a net increase in general and administrative expenses of $23.3 million during 2002, of which $9.0 million was labor expenses. In addition, bad debt expense increased to $42.7 million in 2002 compared to $26.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of the continued deterioration in the overall economy. Legal expense increased by $3.2 million for 2002 and insurance costs increased $1.9 million primarily due to an increase in renewal premium rates in 2002 as compared to 2001. Depreciation expense increased modestly during 2002 resulting from the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during 2002. Increases in our general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in lease expenses resulting from the purchase of our headquarters complex in Mountain View, California in October 2001, and the benefits realized from our restructuring plan announced in April 2002. These benefits included reduction in general and administrative outside consulting expenses of $13.4 million and travel expenses of $2.1 million for 2002. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is due to the fact that consolidated revenues increased at a faster rate than general and administrative expenses over the same periods as a result of our acquisitions of Illuminet Holdings and H.O. Systems. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease on an absolute basis in 2004 due to the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business. Restructuring and Other Charges 2003 Restructuring Plan In October 2003, we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. The initiative resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposals of property and equipment and other charges. As a result of the 2003 restructuring plan, and in conformity with SFAS No. 146 and SFAS No. 112, we incurred restructuring and other charges amounting to approximately $54.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. 49 Table of Contents Workforce reduction. The 2003 restructuring plan resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 100 employees in the fourth quarter of 2003. We recognized workforce reduction charges of approximately $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits. Excess facilities. We recorded charges of approximately $28.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2003 for excess facilities located in the United States and Europe that were either abandoned or downsized relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs. To determine the lease loss, which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing an abandoned building or separable portion thereof, certain estimates were made related to the (1) time period over which the relevant space would remain vacant, (2) sublease terms, and (3) sublease rates, including common area charges. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional $26 million over the next eleven years related to the 2003 restructuring plan. Exit costs. We recorded other exit costs primarily relating to the realignment of our Communications Services business. These charges totaled approximately $1.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2003. Other charges. Property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned in the fourth quarter of 2003, but not related to the sale of the Network Solutions business, resulted in a net charge of approximately $18.4 million and consisted primarily of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment. Additionally, other costs not related to the sale of Network Solutions amounted to $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 Restructuring and other charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2003 relating to the 2003 restructuring plan are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, 2003 (In thousands) Workforce reduction $ 5,724 Excess facilities 28,303 Exit costs 1,039 Subtotal 35,066 Other charges 19,086 Total restructuring and other charges $ 54,152 As of December 31, 2003, the accrued liability associated with the 2003 restructuring plan was $32.4 million and consisted of the following: Restructuring Charges Non CashRestructuring Charges CashPayments Accrued RestructuringCosts atDecember 31,2003 (In thousands) Workforce reduction $ 5,724 $ $ (328 ) $ 5,396 Excess facilities 28,303 (1,911 ) 26,392 Exit costs 1,039 (1,039 ) Sub total 35,066 (3,278 ) 31,788 Other charges 19,086 (18,374 ) (148 ) 564 Total restructuring and other charges $ 54,152 $ (18,374 ) $ (3,426 ) $ 32,352 Included in current portion of long term restructuring $ 11,835 Included in long term restructuring $ 20,517 50 Table of Contents 2002 Restructuring Plan In April 2002, we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources. This restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, write off of abandoned property and equipment and other charges. As a result of this plan, in conformity with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 100 and EITF Issues No. 94 3 and 88 10, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $20.5 million during 2003 and $88.6 million during 2002. Workforce reduction. Our 2002 restructuring plan resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees across certain business functions, operating units, and geographic regions. Workforce reduction charges of approximately $1.5 million and $6.2 million were recorded in 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits. Excess facilities. We recorded charges of approximately $8.7 million and $29.7 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively, for excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional $2 million over the next five years relating to the 2002 restructuring plan. Exit costs. We recorded other exit costs consisting of the write off of prepaid license fees associated with products that were originally intended to be incorporated into our product offerings but were subsequently abandoned as a result of the decision to restructure. These charges totaled approximately $1.0 million during 2003 and $9.0 million during 2002. Other charges. As part of our efforts to rationalize, integrate and align resources, we also recorded other charges of $9.2 million during 2003, including $10.9 million paid for the termination of a lease and $9.3 million for the write off of computer software. We recorded other charges of $18.6 million during 2002 relating primarily to the write off of prepaid marketing assets associated with discontinued advertising. Property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned resulted in a net charge of approximately $25.0 million during 2002 and consisted primarily of computer software, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment. Restructuring and other charges, net of adjustments, recorded during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 associated with the 2002 restructuring plan are as follows: Year EndedDecember 31, 2003 2002 (In thousands) Workforce reduction $ 1,545 $ 6,207 Excess facilities 8,694 29,689 Exit costs and other charges 1,014 9,040 Subtotal 11,253 44,936 Other charges 9,228 43,638 Total restructuring and other charges $ 20,481 $ 88,574 51 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003, the accrued liability associated with the 2002 restructuring plans was $16.2 million and consisted of the following: Accrued RestructuringCosts atDecember 31,2002 GrossRestructuring Charges Reversals andAdjustmentstoRestructuringCharges NetRestructuring Charges Non CashRestructuring Charges CashPayments Accrued RestructuringCosts atDecember 31,2003 (In thousands) Workforce reduction $ 113 $ 1,545 $ $ 1,545 $ $ (1,605 ) $ 53 Excess facilities 23,512 8,694 8,694 (16,701 ) 15,505 Exit costs 210 1,014 1,014 (563 ) 661 Sub total 23,835 11,253 11,253 (18,869 ) 16,219 Other charges 20,163 (10,935 ) 9,228 (9,228 ) Total restructuring and other charges $ 23,835 $ 31,416 $ (10,935 ) $ 20,481 $ (9,228 ) $ (18,869 ) $ 16,219 Included in current portion of long term restructuring $ 7,077 $ 6,496 Included in long term restructuring $ 16,758 $ 9,723 Reversals and adjustments to restructuring and other charges of $10.9 million in 2003 is the result of an assignment of a building lease in the United Kingdom to an unrelated third party and due to a favorable re negotiation of a building lease in Herndon, VA. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms the longest of which extends through 2014. Future cash payments and anticipated sublease income, related to lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities are expected to be as follows: ContractualLeasePayments AnticipatedSubleaseIncome Net (In thousands) 2004 $ 16,215 $ (4,558 ) $ 11,657 2005 14,048 (4,594 ) 9,454 2006 9,354 (3,157 ) 6,197 2007 7,307 (3,894 ) 3,413 2008 5,536 (3,428 ) 2,108 Thereafter 26,054 (16,986 ) 9,068 $ 78,514 $ (36,617 ) $ 41,897 52 Table of Contents Cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans, not including other cost savings efforts, were estimated to have been $55 to $60 million in 2003 and are estimated to be approximately $25 to $30 million in 2004. Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets In 2003, in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 and SFAS No. 144, we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions of approximately $336 million compared to $4,895 million in 2002. The decrease in amounts amortized and impaired in 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to our 2002 annual test for impairment which resulted in the impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $4,611 million. Excluding impairment write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets, amortization expense was approximately $182 million in 2003 compared to $284 million in 2002. Amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately $58.4 million for 2004, including the impact of all acquisitions through December 31, 2003, and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges. Our annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2003 resulted in an impairment of the net book value as follows: Internet ServicesGroup CommunicationsServices Group NetworkSolutions TotalSegments (In thousands) Goodwill $ 18,697 $ 20,034 $ 12,954 $ 51,685 Technology in place 27,499 27,499 Customer lists 44,035 44,035 $ 18,697 $ 91,568 $ 12,954 $ 123,219 Additionally, the sale of our Network Solutions business segment in 2003 triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of Network Solutions goodwill. As a result we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2003. In 2002, in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and SFAS No. 144, we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions of approximately $4,895 million compared to $13,570 million in 2001. Excluding impairment write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets, amortization expense was approximately $284 million in 2002 compared to $3,678 million in 2001. The decrease in amortization expense excluding impairments in 2002 from 2001 is due primarily to the effects of the provisions of SFAS No. 142 in which goodwill is no longer amortized. Our annual test for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 resulted in an impairment of the net book value as follows. InternetServicesGroup CommunicationsServices Group NetworkSolutions Total (In thousands) Goodwill $ 1,740,256 $ 794,866 $ 1,851,887 $ 4,387,009 Customer relationships 3,297 24,294 27,591 Technology in place 256 40,693 40,949 Trade name 3,205 3,205 Contracts with ICANN and customer lists 23,092 129,007 152,099 $ 1,743,809 $ 886,150 $ 1,980,894 $ 4,610,853 53 Table of Contents SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. SFAS No. 144 requires that long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset. See Notes 1 and 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, our policy was to assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows. Those cash flows included an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period. Other expense, net Other expense, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. A comparison of total other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below. 2003 %Change 2002 %Change 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Total other income (expense) $ (8,276 ) (94 )% $ (149,289 ) 548 % $ (23,048 ) Percentage of revenues (1 )% (12 )% (2 )% Total other expense, net in 2003 consisted primarily of a net impairment of investments totaling $16.5 million partially offset by net interest income of $7.7 million and a gain on foreign currency transactions of $1.8 million. In the first quarter of 2003, we determined the decline in value of certain non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling $16.5 million. Although our cash and cash equivalents, short and long term investments and restricted cash totaled $763.8 million at the end of 2003, compared to $440.6 million at the end of 2002, interest rate yields have declined substantially resulting in a decrease in interest income in 2003 compared to 2002. Total other expense in 2002 was primarily comprised of an impairment of investments totaling $162.5 million on certain public and non public equity security investments, partially offset by $14.2 million of interest and other income. In 2002, we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and non public equity securities investments was other than temporary and we recorded a net impairment of these investments totaling $162.5 million. Our cash, cash equivalents, short term and long term investments decreased to $440.6 million at December 31, 2002 from $928.5 million at December 31, 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of H.O. Systems, purchases of property and equipment and the decline in value and subsequent impairment of investments during 2002. These actions resulted in a decrease in interest income earned during 2002 as compared to 2001. Income tax benefit (expense) In the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, we recorded income tax expense of $23.4 million and $10.4 million, respectively. We have not recorded a benefit for U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization. As of December 31, 2003, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $624.4 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $515.4 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $75.7 million. If we are not able to use them, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2022 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2005 through 2023. Foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire on various dates. We had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of 54 Table of Contents approximately $6.2 million available for carryover to future years, and for state income tax purposes of approximately $6.2 million available for carryover to future years. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2023. State research and experimental tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes. Liquidity and Capital Resources 2003 2002 %Change (Dollars in thousands) Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments $ 723,686 $ 385,468 88 % Working capital $ 325,201 $ (62,719 ) 619 % Stockholders equity $ 1,383,653 $ 1,579,425 (12 )% At December 31, 2003, our principal source of liquidity was $723.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, market auction securities, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. Working capital increased $387.9 million over the periods presented primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $338.2 million primarily from net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $358.4 million in 2003, $240.1 million in 2002 and $227.5 million in 2001. The increase in both 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items such as amortization and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment and the impairment of certain investments. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities benefited in 2003 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $25.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $38.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $28.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12.8 million after accounting for the sale of our Network Solutions business. In 2002, a substantial decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue, and accounts payable and accrual liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2001. Net cash used in investing activities was $304.2 million in 2003, primarily as a result of $446.4 million used for purchases of short and long term investments and $108.0 million for purchases of property and equipment. These purchases were partially offset by proceeds of $218.0 million from maturities and sales of short and long term investments. Additionally, $57.6 million of cash was provided from the sale of our Network Solutions subsidiary in November 2003. Net cash used in investing activities was $282.5 million in 2002, primarily as a result of $348.6 million used for acquisitions including $346.3 million for the acquisition of H.O. Systems along with an additional $53.6 million used in acquisition related costs during 2002. We also used $132.1 million for purchases of short and long term investments and $176.2 million for purchases of property and equipment. These purchases were partially offset by proceeds of $423.6 million from maturities and sales of short and long term investments. Net cash used in investing activities was $389.1 million in 2001, primarily as a result of $1.3 billion used for purchases of investments, which were offset by proceeds of $1.4 billion from sales and maturities of investments, $380.3 million used for purchases of property and equipment, including approximately $285 million used for the purchase of the land and buildings for our corporate headquarters in California, and $52.6 million paid, net of cash acquired, for business combinations. 55 Table of Contents The following table shows our budgeted capital equipment expenditures in 2004 and our actual expenditures in 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2004Budgeted 2003Actual 2002Actual 2001Actual (Dollars in thousands) Capital equipment expenditures $110,000 $ 108,034 $ 176,233 $ 380,269 Our planned capital expenditures for 2004 are primarily for computer and communications equipment and computer software within our Communications Services Group. Our most significant expenditures are focused on productivity and cost improvement initiatives and market development initiatives for the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group and productivity and cost improvement initiatives for corporate services. As of December 31, 2003, we also had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 to $20 million in the first quarter of 2004 due to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In addition, cash payments totaling approximately $25 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next eleven years. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans, not including other cost savings efforts, were estimated to have been approximately $55 to $60 million in 2003 and are estimated to be approximately $25 to $30 million in 2004. Net cash provided by financing activities was $55.9 million in 2003, $20.3 million in 2002 and $10.8 million in 2001. In 2003, $37.4 million of cash was provided from the sale of subsidiary stock as a result of VeriSign Japan K.K.s initial public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and through subsequent option exercises. Additionally in 2003, $31.7 million was provided by common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises partially offset by $13.2 million for the repayment of debt and other long term obligations. In 2002 and 2001, cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises. In 2001, these proceeds were partially offset by the use of approximately $70 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2001, we repurchased approximately 1,650,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $70 million. During 2003 and 2002, no shares were repurchased and at December 31, 2003, approximately $280 million remained available for future repurchases under this program. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and operating cash flows, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. This additional funding, if needed, might not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage of our stock owned by our then current stockholders will be reduced. Furthermore, these equity securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. We lease a portion of our facilities under operating leases. We also sublease a portion of our office space to third parties. In addition, in November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu Internet top level domain, .tv with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $10.6 million over the next five years. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003, our future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases and our future minimum sublease income are as follows: Operating Lease Payments Sublease Income Net Lease Payments (In thousands) 2004 $ 25,720 $ (4,377 ) $ 21,343 2005 22,175 (3,737 ) 18,438 2006 18,673 (566 ) 18,107 2007 18,273 18,273 2008 16,067 16,067 Thereafter 25,078 25,078 Total $ 125,986 $ (8,680 ) $ 117,306 We have pledged a portion of our short term investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of short term investments we have pledged pursuant to such agreements was approximately $18.4 million. The restructuring accrual is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2014. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional $28 million over the next eleven years relating to our restructuring plans. In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No, 104 Revenue Recognition which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition, in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 57 Table of Contents In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46, and interpretation of ARB Opinion No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46R clarifies the application of ARB 51 Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders. FIN 46R requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. Among other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R (a) clarified some requirements of the original FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003, (b) eased some implementation problems, and (c) added new scope exceptions. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities in practice and under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. Among the scope expectations, companies are not required to apply FIN 46R to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a business as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist. FIN 46R applies immediately to a VIE created or acquired after January 31, 2003. We do not have any interests in VIEs and the adoption of FIN 46R is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Equity investments We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for strategic business purposes. Some of these companies may be publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices. We value these public company investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month. These investments are subject to market price volatility. We reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value, with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders equity. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling $16.5 million, $162.5 million and $87.0 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, and in light of current stock market conditions, we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments. We do not currently hedge against equity price changes. Interest rate sensitivity The primary objective of our non strategic investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at December 31, 2003, this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, medium term notes, corporate bonds and notes, market auction securities, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. In addition, we generally invest in relatively short term securities. As of December 31, 2003, 58% of our non strategic investments mature in less than one year. The following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2003. This table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk.

We transact business in multiple foreign currencies. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk 59 Table of Contents management program, using forward currency contracts to eliminate, reduce, or transfer selected foreign currency risks that are related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations denominated in non functional currencies and which could be identified and quantified. Forward contracts are limited to durations of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2003, only non functional currency balances were hedged. All derivatives were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and in earnings at year end 2003. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. At December 31, 2003, we held a forward contract in a notional amount of $15 million to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations for certain foreign operations. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with high quality financial institutions.
