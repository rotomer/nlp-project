Overview VeriSign, Inc. is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable people and businesses to find, connect, secure, and transact across complex global networks. In 2004, our business consisted of two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Prior to 2004, our business included an additional reportable segment, the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was sold in November 2003. Improving economic conditions during 2004 in the U.S., Europe and Japan led to improved customer spending in each of our principal business segments leading to growth in revenues and deferred revenues. IT spending for security services and e commerce activity in our principal geographic markets accelerated as the year progressed and we saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals, with active domain names ending in .com and .net increasing by 26% during 2004. Spending for our services by telecommunications customers in the United States also increased during the year, and Jamba!, our European based provider of mobile content services to telecommunications carriers and customers that was acquired in June 2004, contributed approximately $180.8 million of revenues during 2004. In the U.S., the Communications Services Groups results were adversely affected as the pace of consolidations in the domestic telecommunications sector quickened during the year. We derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of products and services sold primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan. In the Internet Services Group, more than 83% of the revenues during 2004 were derived from the sale of web certificates, payment services, managed authentication and security services and registry services. In the Communications Services Group, 82% of the revenues were derived from the sale of calling name services, billing services, SS7 connectivity, signaling services, and mobile content services during the same period. For the Communications Services Group, we expect growth in mobile content services revenues, particularly in new markets such as the U.S., offset somewhat by a decline in connectivity, clearing and settlement, and billing related revenues in the first quarter with a return to moderate growth in such revenues expected in the second quarter. Consolidations in the telecommunications sector and pricing pressures have the potential to adversely impact the Communications Services Groups results. For the Internet Services Group, we expect continued growth in the levels of IT spending for security services by our customers in the U.S., Europe and Japan and growth in global e commerce activity that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for 2005. 41 Table of Contents Network Solutions Sale On November 25, 2003, we completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business to Pivotal Private Equity, although we retained a 15% interest in the business. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. VeriSign Japan K.K. On November 22, 2004, we sold 18,000 ordinary shares of our Tokyo based, majority owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. (VeriSign Japan), representing approximately 7% of our ownership interest, for approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, we continue to own a majority stake in VeriSign Japan equal to approximately 54% of VeriSign Japans total shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2003, VeriSign Japan, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Approximately $37.4 million was raised by VeriSign Japan from the initial public offering and through subsequent stock option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2003. VeriSign Japans shares began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on November 19, 2003 under the company code 3722. Acquisitions In October 2004, we acquired the 49% minority interest in Jamba! Switzerland for approximately $0.8 million in cash. Jamba! Switzerland is now a wholly owned subsidiary. In June 2004, we completed our acquisition of Jamba!, a privately held provider of mobile content services. We paid approximately $266 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jamba!, of which approximately $178 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock. Also in June 2004, we acquired the 49% minority interest in VeriSign Australia for approximately $4.6 million in VeriSign common stock. VeriSign Australia is now a wholly owned subsidiary. In April 2004, we completed our acquisition of the SSL certificate business from EuroTrust A/S, our Nordic region Affiliate program member, for approximately $8.5 million in cash. In March 2004, we completed our acquisition of the assets of Unimobile, a provider of mobile messaging solutions for carriers and enterprises, for approximately $5 million in cash. In February 2004, we completed our acquisition of Guardent, Inc., a privately held provider of managed security services. We paid approximately $135 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Guardent, of which approximately $65 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock. In October 2003, we completed our acquisition of UNC Embratel, the clearinghouse division of Embratel, for approximately $16 million. UNC Embratel provides call record tracking, clearing and settlement services for a majority of the mobile and fixed telecommunications carriers in Brazil. In February 2002, we completed our acquisition of H.O. Systems, Inc., a provider of billing and customer care solutions to wireless carriers. We paid approximately $350 million in cash for all of the outstanding stock of H.O. Systems. We accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2004, 2003 and 2002 as purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the acquired companies revenues, costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition. Additionally, the results of operations of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business have been excluded from our consolidated results of operations since we finalized the sale of the business on November 25, 2003. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business in 2003 and our acquisitions during 2004, 2003 and 2002, comparisons of revenues, costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 to the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002 may not be relevant, as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent. 42 Table of Contents Subsequent events On January 10, 2005, we announced that we had executed a definitive agreement to acquire LightSurf Technologies, Inc. (LightSurf). Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to issue shares of our common stock having a value of approximately $270 million for all of the outstanding capital stock, warrants and vested options of LightSurf and to pay certain transaction related expenses of LightSurf. In addition, we will assume all unvested stock options of LightSurf. LightSurf is a leading privately held provider of multimedia messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including the issuance of a permit from the California Department of Corporations. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first quarter of 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, we completed a settlement of litigation with a telecommunications carrier, resolving disputes over certain tariff charges for SS7 traffic that we passed through to telecommunications carriers who purchased our SS7 services. Under the settlement, the carrier refunded and or credited certain amounts to us and we refunded and or credited certain amounts to our customers. As a result of the settlement, we will record a reduction in cost of revenues of approximately $5 million in the first quarter of 2005. Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long lived assets, restructuring, royalty liabilities, and deferred taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles. Revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided. Our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events. Revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the percentage of completion method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed. Percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time and materials are recognized as services are performed. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customers expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an 43 Table of Contents allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. We also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer, industry or geographic region. We require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. As of December 31, 2004, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 5% of total accounts receivable, or approximately $11.5 million. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to approximately $2.1 million. Valuation of long lived intangible assets including goodwill Our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We review long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the assets carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset. Recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $969.2 million at December 31, 2004, which was comprised of $725.4 million of goodwill and $243.8 million of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, carrier relationships, non compete agreements, trade names, and customer lists. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize, integrate and align our resources. Both plans resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and equipment and other charges. We expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2014 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities. Restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis, as necessary. During 2004, we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately $1.3 million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations. Such estimates will likely be revised in the future. If sublease rates continue to change in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional $32.6 million over the next ten years relating to our restructuring plans. Provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights Certain of our mobile content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others. Where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with a holder, we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded. We estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized. Our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property, such as a change in demand for a particular type of content, in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In concluding that a valuation allowance is required to be applied to certain deferred tax assets, we considered such factors as our history of operating losses, our uncertainty as to the projected long term operating results, and the nature of our deferred tax assets. Although our operating plans assume taxable and operating income in future periods, our evaluation of all of the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets indicated that such plans were not considered sufficient to overcome the available negative evidence. The possible future reversal of the valuation allowance will result in future income statement benefit to the extent the valuation allowance was applied to deferred tax assets generated through ongoing operations. To the extent the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets generated through stock compensation deductions, the possible future reversal of such valuation allowance will result in a credit to additional paid in capital and will not result in future income statement benefit. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues In 2004, we had two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. In 2003, we had three reportable segments: the Internet Services Group, the Communications Services Group and Network Solutions. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003, we do not recognize revenues from this segment other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. A comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Internet Services Group $ 564,148 29 % $ 436,216 (17 )% $ 524,765 Communications Services Group 602,307 48 % 406,745 5 % 385,734 Network Solutions (100 )% 211,819 (32 )% 311,169 Total revenues $ 1,166,455 11 % $ 1,054,780 (14 )% $ 1,221,668 Total revenues increased approximately $111.7 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to revenue increases in both our Internet Services Group and Communications Services Group, partially offset by the loss of revenues as a result of the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business in November 2003. Total revenues decreased approximately $166.9 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to decreases in both our Internet Services Group and Network Solutions, partially offset by an increase in revenues in our Communications Services Group. Internet Services Group Internet Services Group revenues increased approximately $127.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to increases in Naming and Directory Services and Security Services revenues of approximately $65.1 million and $62.8 million, respectively. Naming and Directory Services revenues increased as a result of recognizing revenues from Network Solutions, that were previously eliminated prior to the sale of this business. In addition, we experienced an increase in the number of active domain names ending in .com and .net under management. The Security Services revenue increase was due to increases in managed security services and consulting services revenues of $18.5 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of Guardent in February 2004 and increases in Web site digital certificate revenue and secure payments services revenue of $22.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Internet Services Group revenues decreased approximately $88.5 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decline in Security Services revenues of approximately $123.0 million resulting from the discontinuation of third party product sales and related consulting and support services and a decline in revenues from VeriSign Affiliates of $19.0 million. The decreases in revenues were partially offset by an increase in revenues of $10.1 million from our secure payments services, an increase in Web site digital certificate revenue of $23.5 million and an increase in Naming and Directory Services revenues of $20.8 million. The following table compares active domain names ending in .com and .net managed by our Naming and Directory Services business, the approximate installed base of Web site digital certificates in our commerce site services business and the approximate number of active online merchants in our secured payments services business as of the end of each year presented: December 31,2004 %Change December 31,2003 %Change December 31,2002 Active domain names ending in .com and .net 38.4 million 26 % 30.4 million 18 % 25.8 million Installed base of Web site digital certificates 455,000 18 % 384,000 (2 )% 392,000 Active online merchants 127,000 25 % 102,000 23 % 83,000 46 Table of Contents We expect Internet Services Group revenues will continue to grow in 2005 as demand for our Naming and Directory Services and Security Services is expected to grow. Communications Services Group Communications Services Group revenues increased approximately $195.6 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to an increase in mobile content revenues of $180.8 million attributable to our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. In addition, intelligent database services revenues increased approximately $15.0 million primarily due to increases in calling name (CNAM) and local and wireless number portability revenues. Applications services revenues increased $3.5 million due to increases in messaging services traffic. Billing and payment services revenues declined $8.8 million primarily due to pricing reductions for these services and loss of customers due to consolidation in the telecommunications industry. Clearing and settlement services increased $5.3 million primarily from increases in revenues from VeriSign Brazil reflecting the inclusion of a full year of revenues from this subsidiary that was acquired in October 2003. Communications Services Group revenues increased approximately $21.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, as a result of an increase in clearing and settlement services revenues of $18.2 million and an increase in network connectivity and interoperability revenues of $1.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in CNAM revenues of $2.2 million. The following table compares the approximate number of annual database queries and communications services customers as of the end of each year presented: December 31,2004 %Change December 31,2003 %Change December 31,2002 Annual database queries 47.3 billion 44 % 32.8 billion 13 % 28.9 billion Communications services customers (1) 1,275 8 % 1,177 14 % 1,035 (1) excludes subscribers of mobile content services. We expect Communications Services Group revenues will increase in 2005 principally as a result of growth in mobile content and applications revenues. Network Solutions We completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003 and recognized no revenues from this segment in 2004. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. Network Solutions revenues declined $99.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002 principally due to weaker demand for new domain name registrations and a decline in total domain names under management. Active domain names under management were approximately 8.2 million names as of November 25, 2003, the date we sold Network Solutions, compared to 9.3 million at December 31, 2002. In addition, the revenue decline reflects the completion of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003 which resulted in 329 days of consolidated revenues for 2003 compared to a full year in 2002. 47 Table of Contents Revenues by Geographic Region Our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The following table shows a comparison of our revenues by geographic region for each year presented: 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Americas: United States $ 843,604 $ 941,913 $ 1,115,731 Other (1) 19,734 13,080 6,343 Total Americas 863,338 954,993 1,122,074 EMEA (2) 237,310 48,217 54,345 APAC (3) 65,807 51,570 45,249 Total revenues $ 1,166,455 $ 1,054,780 $ 1,221,668 (1) Canada, Latin America and South America (2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (3) Australia, Japan and Asia Pacific (APAC) Revenues decreased $91.7 million in the Americas region in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily as a result of the sale of Network Solutions in November 2003. Revenues in our EMEA region increased $189.1 million in the same period primarily due to the acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004, which contributed approximately $180.8 million in 2004. In addition, increases in our web certificate and managed PKI sales in EMEA also contributed to the increase, partially offset by decreases in our VeriSign Affiliate revenue as we continued to move to a direct distribution model through international subsidiaries in certain larger European markets. The increase in APAC revenues of $14.2 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to increased enterprise security sales in both the Japan and Australian markets, partially offset by a decrease in VeriSign Affiliate revenue. Revenues decreased $167.1 million in the Americas region in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily as a result of the discontinuation of third party product sales and the related support services in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decrease in EMEA revenues of $6.1 million in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily related to a decrease in VeriSign Affiliate revenue partially offset by increases in web certificate and managed PKI revenues. The increase in APAC revenues of $6.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily related to an increase in enterprise security sales in both the Japan and Australian markets, partially offset by a decrease in VeriSign Affiliate revenue. We expect international revenues will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in 2005. Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased by $248.3 million, or 19%, to $1,034.7 million during fiscal 2004 compared with the prior year. This was primarily due to a decrease in the charges we incurred for the amortization and impairment of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Amortization and impairment charges totaled approximately $79.4 million in 2004 compared to $335.5 million in 2003. Additionally, there were decreases in restructuring and other charges of $49.9 million, offset by increases of $58.2 million in sales and marketing expenses and $11.5 million in research and development expenses in 2004 compared to 2003. We restructured our business in April of 2002 and again in November of 2003. As a result of these restructurings, and as a result of the sale of our Network Solutions business, we have experienced a significant reduction in overall costs in 2004 compared to 2003. 48 Table of Contents The following table shows a comparison of our employee headcount by function as of the end of each year presented: December 31,2004 %Change December 31,2003 %Change December 31,2002 Employee headcount: Cost of revenues 1,500 32 % 1,136 (24 )% 1,500 Sales and marketing 708 28 % 552 (20 )% 693 Research and development 430 60 % 269 (32 )% 398 General and administrative 568 11 % 514 (15 )% 602 Total 3,206 30 % 2,471 (23 )% 3,193 Excluding the effects of any future acquisitions or dispositions, we expect our employee headcount to increase in 2005 across all business units and corporate services. As a result of our acquisition of Guardent and Jamba! we added approximately 700 employees to our overall headcount, primarily in the cost of revenues function. The sale of our Network Solutions business in November 2003 resulted in a headcount reduction of 577 employees, primarily in the cost of revenues function. Cost of revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services, payment services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, operational costs related to the management and monitoring of our clients network security infrastructures, content licensing costs, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP based networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities. A comparison of cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 444,759 (0.3 )% $ 446,207 (22 )% $ 571,367 Percentage of revenues 38 % 42 % 47 % Cost of revenues decreased approximately $1.4 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due a decrease of $69.5 million as a result of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was offset by increases attributable to the acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent of $49.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively. Cost of revenues decreased $125.2 million in 2003, as compared to 2002 primarily due to our transition out of the third party product reseller and the third party product training businesses. This transition accounted for a decrease of approximately $105.9 million. Also, compensation costs decreased approximately $9.6 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to a reduction in employee headcount related to our restructuring plans announced in 2002 and 2003, while contract and professional services fees declined approximately $12.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to the discontinuation of certain outsourced customer service centers for our Network Solutions registrar business. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the sale of the Network Solutions business, which was a business with higher costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our other two business segments. We anticipate that our overall cost of revenues will increase in 2005, but that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will stay flat or decrease modestly in 2005 primarily due to greater cost efficiencies from our current businesses and recently acquired businesses, particularly mobile content services. 49 Table of Contents Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs. A comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 253,480 30 % $ 195,330 (21 )% $ 248,170 Percentage of revenues 22 % 19 % 20 % Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $58.2 million in 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to our acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent, which had sales and marketing expenses of $80.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a decrease of $38.3 million in sales and marketing expenses due to the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $7.1 million in advertising and marketing costs during this period primarily as a result of increased corporate brand advertising. Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $52.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a reduction in advertising and marketing spending and a reduction in labor and benefit costs. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased approximately $22.5 million in 2003 due to a significant reduction in Network Solutions marketing campaigns during 2003. Labor and benefits costs decreased approximately $19.8 million in 2003 related to a reduction in employee headcount associated with our restructuring plans. Additionally, contract and professional services expenses decreased approximately $6.6 million due to an overall reduction in sales and marketing service contracts in 2003. Travel expenses decreased approximately $1.8 million in 2003 due to reduced employee headcount and an overall decrease in international travel as a result of safety concerns stemming from health and terrorism alerts. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the increase in advertising and marketing spending in 2004 compared to 2003 as described above. We expect increases in overall sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues as we continue to expand in our domestic and international markets for our mobile content services, along with our continuing efforts in marketing new products such as Unified Authentication and related services, and increases in our spending for corporate brand advertising. Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development. A comparison of research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 67,346 21 % $ 55,806 15 % $ 48,353 Percentage of revenues 6 % 5 % 4 % 50 Table of Contents Research and development expenses increased $11.5 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to our acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba!. Research and development spending attributable to these acquired entities was $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The sale of our Network Solutions business had no material effect on our research and development expense. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $4.1 million in increased costs associated with contract and professional services to support new and existing research and development efforts. Research and development expenses increased slightly in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase of approximately $7.5 million was primarily a result of increased spending of approximately $3.6 million in the Communications Services Group. Additionally, our naming and directory services had increased equipment, software and depreciation expenses related to the development of new products and services of approximately $2.0 million. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2004 compared to 2003 as described above. We believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenues in 2005. General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense. A comparison of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) General and administrative $ 164,922 (2 )% $ 168,380 (2 )% $ 172,123 Percentage of revenues 14 % 16 % 14 % General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.5 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Overall general and administrative expenses increased from the acquisition of Guardent, Inc. and Jamba! in the amounts of $4.2 million and $16.5 million, respectively, but was offset by a decrease of $9.8 million in overall expenses due to the sale of our Network Solutions business. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba! and the sale of our Network Solutions business, the overall decrease in general and administrative costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 was $14.4 million. This was primarily due to a reduction in costs from prior restructuring efforts of approximately $20.8 million, along with other efficiencies from cost reduction efforts of $6.5 million and a decrease in our bad debt expense of approximately $5.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately $10.9 million as a result of costs associated with litigation, and increases in contract and professional services of approximately $7.4 million primarily due to expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.7 million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately $36.7 million due to increased focus on collection activities, 51 Table of Contents partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately $7.4 million as a result of defending various lawsuits, particularly lawsuits related to the Network Solutions business, and contract and professional services of approximately $6.1 million primarily due to the development of a companywide strategic planning methodology, tax services and increased expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Additionally, depreciation increased $5.9 million as a result of capital expenditures to upgrade our business systems and labor and benefits increased approximately $5.8 million due to higher benefit costs. Also, we incurred increased occupancy expenses of approximately $2.1 million in 2003 due to the expansion of a facility in Virginia and increases in business insurance, licenses and property taxes of $3.7 million. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2005 will increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of overall revenues. We expect that costs associated with Sarbanes Oxley compliance to decrease slightly during the year and we anticipate to further leverage our general and administrative costs as a result of higher overall revenues. The following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense and our days sales outstanding (DSO) for 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Bad debt expense $689 (89)% $6,055 (86)% $42,712 DSO 43 days 4 days 39 days (33) days 72 days DSO increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily as a result of our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. We expect that DSO will be in the range of 40 to 50 days throughout 2005. Restructuring and Other Charges Below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges under the 2003 and 2002 restructuring plans for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) 2003 Restructuring Plan charges $ 25,045 $ 54,152 $ 2002 Restructuring Plan charges (265 ) 20,481 88,574 Total restructuring and other charges $ 24,780 $ 74,633 $ 88,574 The changes in restructuring and other charges are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives. 2003 Restructuring Plan. In 2003, we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately $54.2 million. In 2004, property and equipment that was disposed of or abandoned in 2004, but not related to the sale of the Network Solutions business, resulted in a net charge of approximately $20.3 million and consisted primarily of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment. We also recorded restructuring charges of $2.7 million related to non cancelable lease costs for excess facilities, $1.1 million related to workforce reduction charges and $1.0 million for exit costs. 2002 Restructuring Plan. In 2002, we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources and recorded approximately $88.6 million of restructuring and other charges. In 2003, we recorded other charges of $9.2 million related to the write off of certain computer software. We also recorded restructuring charges of $8.7 million related to non cancelable lease costs for excess facilities, $1.5 million related to workforce reduction charges and $1.0 million of exit costs. 52 Table of Contents Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Below is a comparison of our amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Impairment of goodwill $ $ 81,885 $ 4,387,009 Impairment of other intangible assets 71,534 223,844 Amortization of other intangible assets 79,440 182,086 283,861 Total amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 79,440 $ 335,505 $ 4,894,714 SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. SFAS No. 144 requires that long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset. There was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment test conducted in June 2004. The annual impairment test conducted in June 2003 resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of $123.2 million during the second quarter of 2003. VeriSign recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of VeriSign entering into an agreement to sell its Network Solutions business. The event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture, VeriSign determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of Network Solutions goodwill. Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to the Companys operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2003 are as follows: Internet ServicesGroup CommunicationsServices Group NetworkSolutions TotalSegments (In thousands) Impairment of goodwill $ 18,697 $ 20,034 $ 43,154 $ 81,885 Impairment of other intangible assets: Technology in place 27,499 27,499 Customer lists 44,035 44,035 Total impairment of other intangible assets 71,534 71,534 Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 18,697 $ 91,568 $ 43,154 $ 153,419 53 Table of Contents The impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment test resulted in an impairment in 2002 as follows: InternetServicesGroup CommunicationsServices Group NetworkSolutions Total (In thousands) Goodwill $ 1,740,256 $ 794,866 $ 1,851,887 $ 4,387,009 Impairment of other intangible assets: Customer relationships 3,297 24,294 27,591 Technology in place 256 40,693 40,949 Trade name 3,205 3,205 Contracts with ICANN and customer lists 23,092 129,007 152,099 Total impairment of other intangible assets 3,553 91,284 129,007 223,844 Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 1,743,809 $ 886,150 $ 1,980,894 $ 4,610,853 Amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately $102.6 million in 2004 compared to 2003, and decreased approximately $101.8 million in 2003 compared to 2002 as other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized. We acquired approximately $83.9 million of other intangible assets in connection with our Jamba! acquisition in June 2004. As a result, we expect amortization of other intangible assets to increase to approximately $90 million in 2005, including the impact of all acquisitions through December 31, 2004, and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges. See Notes 1 and 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. A comparison of total other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented below. 2004 %Change 2003 %Change 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Total other income (expense), net $ 82,077 1,092 % $ (8,276 ) (94 )% $ (149,289 ) Percentage of revenues 7 % (1 )% (12 )% Total other income, net in 2004 consisted primarily of net interest income and other items of $17.7 million, a net gain from the sale of a portion of the companys holdings in VeriSign Japan and other investments of $79.8 million, partially offset by a net impairment of investments totaling $12.6 million, and a net loss on foreign currency transactions of $2.9 million. In the first and third quarter of 2004, we determined the decline in value of certain non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized the net impairment losses totaling $12.6 million described above. Total other expense, net in 2003 consisted primarily of a net impairment of investments totaling $16.5 million, partially offset by net interest income of $7.7 million and a gain on foreign currency transactions of $1.8 million. In the first quarter of 2003, we determined the decline in value of certain non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling $16.5 million. 54 Table of Contents Income tax expense In the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded income tax expense of $27.6 million, or 12.9% of pretax income, $23.4 million, or (9.9)% of pretax loss, and $10.4 million, or (0.2)% of pretax loss, respectively. Our effective tax rates differ from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state taxes, acquisition related expenses, the realization of domestic net operating loss, capital loss, and research credit carryforwards, and the impact of foreign operations. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors, including the Companys past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. federal and state operations are realizable. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be increased in the near future if the Company exhibits sufficient positive evidence in future periods that demonstrate the continuation of its trend in projected earnings is achievable. If the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of December 31, 2004, approximately $240.7 million would be credited to the statement of operations, $268.6 million would be credited to additional paid in capital, and $5.4 million would be credited to goodwill. Management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of $33.4 million to the deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards, and $48.9 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write down of investments, due to the limited carryover life of such tax attributes. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that $11.2 million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable; therefore, a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset. On the remaining foreign operations, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets. As of December 31, 2004, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $697.9 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $555.9 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $49.0 million. If we are not able to use them, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2005 through 2023. Foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire on various dates. We had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately $18.6 million available for carryover to future years, and for state income tax purposes of approximately $13.9 million available for carryover to future years. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2024. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes. Liquidity and Capital Resources 2004 2003 2002 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 330,641 $ 301,593 $ 254,505 Short term investments 406,784 422,093 130,963 Subtotal $ 737,425 $ 723,686 $ 385,468 Restricted cash 51,518 18,371 18,436 Total $ 788,943 $ 742,057 $ 403,904 Working capital $ 306,528 $ 325,522 $ (62,719 ) At December 31, 2004, our principal source of liquidity was $737.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. 55 Table of Contents Working capital increased $369.2 million over the periods presented primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $352.0 million primarily from net cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $365.3 million in 2004, $358.4 million in 2003 and $240.1 million in 2002. The increase in both 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items such as amortization and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and depreciation of property and equipment. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities increased in 2004 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $69.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $44.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $65.8 million. In 2003, an increase in accounts payable of $38.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $28.0 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $25.5 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12.8 million after accounting for the sale of our Network Solutions business contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities. In 2002, a substantial decrease in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2001. Net cash used in investing activities was $284.9 million in 2004, primarily as a result of $246.4 million used for our acquisitions and $15.9 million used for net purchases of investments. In addition, we used approximately $92.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $78.3 million in proceeds from the sale of stock in our VeriSign Japan subsidiary. Net cash used in investing activities was $368.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of $292.8 million used for net purchases of investments, $108.0 million for purchases of property and equipment, and $16.1 million for our acquisitions. These purchases were partially offset by proceeds of $57.6 million of cash received from the sale of our Network Solutions subsidiary in November 2003. Net cash used in investing activities was $297.6 million in 2002, primarily as a result of $348.6 million used for acquisitions with an additional $53.6 million used in acquisition related costs. We also used $176.2 million for purchases of property and equipment. These purchases were partially offset by net proceeds of $276.4 million from maturities and sales of short and long term investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $54.5 million in 2004 and net cash provided by financing activities was $55.9 million in 2003 and $20.3 million in 2002. In 2004, $113.3 million was used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program. These repurchases were partially offset by $62.4 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. In 2003, $37.4 million of cash was provided as a result of VeriSign Japans initial public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and through subsequent option exercises. Additionally, in 2003, $31.7 million was provided by common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan partially offset by $13.2 million for the repayment of debt and other long term obligations. In 2002, cash was provided primarily from common stock issuances in the amount of $20.7 million as a result of stock option exercises and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan. The following table shows our budgeted capital property and equipment expenditures in 2005 and our actual expenditures in 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2005Budgeted 2004Actual 2003Actual 2002Actual (In thousands) Capital property and equipment expenditures $ 110,000 $ 92,532 $ 108,034 $ 176,233 56 Table of Contents Our planned capital property and equipment expenditures for 2005 are anticipated to be approximately $110 million and will primarily be for computer and communications equipment and computer software within all areas of the Company. Our most significant expenditures will be focused on productivity, cost improvement and market development initiatives for the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Other capital property and equipment expenditures will be for productivity and cost improvement initiatives for corporate services. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 13 years 35 years More than5 years Contractual obligations (In thousands) Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income $ 106,494 $ 23,537 $ 31,639 $ 21,435 $ 29,883 Purchase obligations 128,450 30,458 69,700 28,292 Other long term liabilities 8,400 2,200 4,200 2,000 Total $ 243,344 $ 56,195 $ 105,539 $ 51,727 $ 29,883 As of December 31, 2004, we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess facilities included in VeriSigns restructuring plans. The restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2014. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional $32.6 million over the next ten years relating to our restructuring plans. Cash payments totaling approximately $60.5 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next ten years. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans, not including other cost savings efforts, were estimated to have been approximately $15 to $20 million in 2004 and are estimated to be approximately $25 to $30 million in 2005. In November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu Internet top level domain, .tv with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $8.4 million through 2008. We have pledged a portion of our short term investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. We have pledged approximately $6.5 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. In addition, we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of $45.0 million classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability self insurance coverage. In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2003 and 2002, no shares were repurchased, however, during 2004, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $113 million. At December 31, 2004, approximately $167 million remained available for future repurchases under this program. VeriSign entered into a five year agreement with Bank of America effective June 1, 2000 to provide a $15 million unsecured capital expenditure loan facility. The loan was paid in full on December 16, 2003. 57 Table of Contents In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and operating cash flows, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Acquisitions or investments to be funded with cash may require us to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. This additional funding, if needed, might not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage of our stock owned by our then current stockholders will be reduced. Furthermore, these equity securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Stock Compensation Plans and Unearned Compensation in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2002 through 2004, as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109 1 (FAS 109 1), Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The AJCA introduces a special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS 109 1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS 109. Pursuant to the AJCA, we will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109 2 (FAS 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004. The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. FAS 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03 1 (EITF 03 1), The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03 1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03 1; however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after June 15, 2004. 58 Table of Contents We do not expect the adoption of EITF 03 1 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Equity investments We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized net impairment losses totaling $8.2 million, $16.5 million, and $162.5 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, and in light of current stock market conditions, we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments. Interest rate sensitivity The primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns. Some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value. To minimize interest rate risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, medium term notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of December 31, 2004, 38% of our cash investments mature in less than one year. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at December 31, 2004, this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio. The following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2004. This table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk.

As we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange 59 Table of Contents risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies. The primary objective of this hedging program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2004, we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately $54.5 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All hedge contracts are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions.
