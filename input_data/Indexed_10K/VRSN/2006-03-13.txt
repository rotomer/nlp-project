Overview VeriSign, Inc. is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable and protect billions of interactions everyday across the worlds voice and data networks. In 2005 and 2004, our business consisted of two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Prior to 2004, our business included an additional reportable segment, the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was sold in November 2003. Improving economic conditions during 2005 in the U.S., Europe and Japan led to improved IT spending for security services and e commerce activity in those markets. We also saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals, with active domain names ending in .com and .net increasing by 30% during 2005. Communication Services Group revenues increased significantly primarily due to increases in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year. Our content business grew in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased competition, pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers. We derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of services sold primarily in the United States, Europe and Japan. In the Internet Services Group, more than 87% of the revenues during 2005 were derived from the sale of registry services, managed authentication and security services and web certificates. In the Communications Services Group, approximately 89% of the revenues were derived from the sale of content services, signaling services, SS7 connectivity, billing services and calling name services during the same period. For the Communications Services Group, we expect content services revenues to decline in the first quarter of 2006, compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and expect connectivity, clearing and settlement, and billing related revenues to be unchanged. Increased competition and continued consolidation in the telecommunications sector has increased pricing pressures and will continue to have the potential to adversely impact the Communications Services Groups results. For the Internet Services Group, we expect continued growth in the levels of IT spending for security services by our customers in the U.S., Europe and Japan and continued growth in domain name registrations and renewals that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for the first quarter of 2006. 42 Table of Contents Payment Gateway Business Sale On November 18, 2005, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our payment gateway business to PayPal, Inc. and PayPal International Limited for $370 million in cash. This transaction has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets and, accordingly, we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods to reflect this transaction. Domain Name Registrar Business Sale On November 25, 2003, we completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business to Pivotal Private Equity, although we retained a 15% interest in the business. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. VeriSign Japan K.K. On November 22, 2004, we sold 18,000 ordinary shares of our Tokyo based, majority owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. (VeriSign Japan), representing approximately 7% of our ownership interest, for approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, we continue to own a majority stake in VeriSign Japan equal to approximately 54% of VeriSign Japans total shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2003, VeriSign Japan, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Approximately $37.4 million was raised by VeriSign Japan from the initial public offering and through subsequent stock option exercises during the fourth quarter of 2003. VeriSign Japans shares began trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on November 19, 2003 under the company code 3722. Acquisitions In October 2005, we completed our acquisition of Retail Solutions International, Inc. (RSI), a Lincoln, Rhode Island based privately held provider of operational point of sale data to the retail industry. We paid approximately $23.2 million in cash for all of the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and assumed unvested stock options of RSI. In October 2005, we completed our acquisition of Moreover Technologies, Inc., a privately held wholesale aggregator of real time internet content. We paid approximately $29.7 million in cash for all the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and transaction related expenses of Moreover. In October 2005, VeriSign Japan completed its acquisition of siteRock K.K., a Tokyo based privately held remote network monitoring and outage managing and handling firm. VeriSign Japan paid approximately $53.3 million in cash for siteRock K.K. In July 2005, we completed our acquisition of iDefense, Inc., a Reston, Virginia based privately held provider of detailed intelligence on network based threats, vulnerabilities and malicious code. We paid approximately $37.8 million in cash for all the outstanding capital stock, vested stock options and certain transaction related expenses and assumed unvested stock options of iDefense. Payment of up to $10 million of additional consideration may be made in the future, if additional contractual conditions are met. In April 2005, we completed our acquisition of LightSurf Technologies, Inc., a Santa Cruz, California based privately held provider of multimedia messaging and interoperability solutions for the wireless market. We paid approximately $279 million in common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock, warrants, vested stock options and certain transaction related expenses and assumed unvested stock options of LightSurf. 43 Table of Contents In June 2004, we completed our acquisition of Jamba!, a privately held provider of content services. We paid approximately $266 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jamba!, of which approximately $178 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock. Also, in June 2004, we acquired the 49% minority interest in VeriSign Australia for approximately $4.6 million in VeriSign common stock. VeriSign Australia is now a wholly owned subsidiary. In February 2004, we completed our acquisition of Guardent, Inc., a privately held provider of managed security services. We paid approximately $135 million for all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Guardent, of which approximately $65 million was in cash and the remainder in VeriSign common stock. In addition to the above, we also completed several other acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003 that were not material on an individual basis or in the aggregate. We accounted for all of our acquisitions in 2005, 2004 and 2003 as purchase business combinations. Accordingly, the acquired companies revenues, costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business in 2003 and our acquisitions during 2005, 2004 and 2003, comparisons of revenues, costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 to the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003 may not be relevant, as the businesses represented in the consolidated financial statements were not equivalent. Subsequent events On January 10, 2006, we completed our accelerated share repurchase program (ASR) executed on November 21, 2005. The final discounted volume weighted average price was $22.20. As a result of settling the ASR, we received an additional 482,459 shares of our common stock. On January 9, 2006, Network Solutions repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the Secured Senior Promissory Note dated November 25, 2003. In addition, Network Solutions redeemed our 15% equity interest in Network Solutions. We received approximately $50.3 million in total. As a result of the redemption of the membership interests, we no longer own equity interests in any Internet domain name registrars. On January 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of CallVision, a Seattle based privately held provider of online analysis applications for mobile communications customers. We paid approximately $38.2 million in cash for the acquisition. On February 13, 2006, we entered into a $75 million ASR agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated (MSCO). Under the ASR agreement, we purchased approximately 3.2 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of approximately $23.70. We acquired these shares as part of our previously announced program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. Under the ASR agreement, MSCO will purchase an equivalent number of shares of common stock in the open market from time to time until it has acquired that number. At the end of this period, we may receive, and may be required to remit, a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of our common shares during the period. The purchase price adjustment can be settled, at our election, in cash or in shares of our common stock. The program is subject to a cap that will establish the maximum price per share. On February 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Kontiki, Inc., a Mountain View, California based privately held provider of secure, broadband content delivery services. We have agreed to pay approximately $62.1 million in cash subject to certain closing adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2006. On February 28, 2006, we completed our acquisition of 3united Mobile Solutions ag (3united), a Vienna, Austria based provider of wireless application services, for approximately $69.0 million in cash. 44 Table of Contents Critical accounting policies and significant management estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long lived assets, restructuring, stock based compensation, royalty liabilities, and deferred income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles. Revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided. Our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events. Revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the proportional performance method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time and materials contracts are recognized as services are performed. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customers expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. We require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. As of December 31, 2005, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 4% of total accounts receivable, or approximately $11.6 million. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to approximately $2.8 million. Valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles Our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 45 Table of Contents We review long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the assets carrying amount in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset. Recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005, which was comprised of $1.1 billion of goodwill and $0.2 billion of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, carrier relationships, non compete agreements, trade names, and other. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill. Restructuring and Other Charges In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize, integrate and align our resources. Both plans resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and equipment and other charges. We expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2014 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities. Restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis, as necessary. During 2005, we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately $0.5 million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations. Such estimates will likely be revised in the future. If sublease rates continue to change in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional $19.2 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans. Accounting for Stock Based Incentive Programs Through December 31, 2005, we measured compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method, we did not record compensation expense when 46 Table of Contents stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted. We also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we disclosed our pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs. To determine the pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123, we estimated the fair value of our options using the Black Scholes option valuation model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price. The assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the future, we may elect to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes valuation model or a different valuation model, which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, (SFAS 123R), Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in their consolidated statements of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share. Provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights Certain of our content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others. Where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with the owner or license holder, we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded. We estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized. Our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property, such as a change in demand for a particular type of content, in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate. Income Taxes We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider past performance, expected future taxable income and prudent feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. Our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated. Changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income. These changes, if any, may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded. 47 Table of Contents In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations. We account for income tax contingencies in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (SFAS 5), Accounting for Contingencies. Results of Operations Revenues In 2005 and 2004, we had two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. In 2003, we had three reportable segments: the Internet Services Group, the Communications Services Group and Network Solutions. As a result of our sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003, we do not recognize revenues from this segment other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. A comparison of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below. 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Internet Services Group $ 633,784 23 % $ 515,999 29 % $ 398,781 Communications Services Group 975,710 62 % 602,307 48 % 406,745 Network Solutions (100 )% 211,819 Total revenues $ 1,609,494 44 % $ 1,118,306 10 % $ 1,017,345 Internet Services Group Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Revenues from our Internet Services Group increased approximately by $117.8 million in 2005, in comparison to 2004, primarily due to the increase in Information Services and Security Services revenues of approximately $62.1 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The Information Services revenue increase was attributed to an increase in the number of active domains ending in .com and .net under management. The increase in Security Services revenues was primarily due to an increase in Website digital certificate revenues of $29.2 million and an increase in managed security services and security consulting revenues of $17.2 million. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Internet Services Group revenues increased approximately $117.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to increases in Information Services and Security Services revenues of approximately $65.7 million and $51.5 million, respectively. Information Services revenues increased as a result of recognizing revenues from Network Solutions, that were previously eliminated prior to the sale of the domain name registrar business and as a result of an increase in the number of active domain names ending in .com and .net under management. The Security Services revenue increase was due to increases in managed security services and consulting services revenues of $18.5 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of Guardent in February 2004 and increases in Web site digital certificate revenue of $22.3 million. The following table compares active domain names ending in .com and .net managed by our Information Services business and the approximate installed base of Web site digital certificates in our commerce site services business as of the end of each year presented: December 31,2005 %Change December 31,2004 %Change December 31,2003 Active domain names ending in .com and .net 50.0 million 30 % 38.4 million 26 % 30.4 million Installed base of Web site digital certificates 489,000 7 % 455,000 18 % 384,000 48 Table of Contents We expect Internet Services Group revenues will grow in the first quarter of 2006 as demand for domain names as well as the number of installed digital certificates is expected to continue to increase. Communications Services Group Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Revenues from our Communications Services Group increased approximately $373.4 million primarily due to a $377.1 million increase in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue in 2005 as compared to the last seven months of 2004 coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year. The content business grew in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the comparable periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased competition, pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers. Network services and connectivity revenues increased approximately $7.0 million and clearing, roaming, settlement and intelligent network services revenues also increased by approximately $10.9 million primarily due an increase in the number of records and transactions cleared. These increases were offset by a decline in billing and payment services of approximately $24.7 million primarily due to a decline in the customer base and pricing reductions for these services during the year. Intelligent database services revenues were unchanged from 2004 as increases in queries were off set by price declines in our calling name (CNAM) service. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Communications Services Group revenues increased approximately $195.6 million primarily due to an increase in content revenues of $180.8 million attributable to our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. In addition, intelligent database services revenues increased approximately $15.0 million primarily due to increases in calling name (CNAM) and local and wireless number portability revenues. The following table compares the approximate number of annual database queries as of the end of each year presented: December 31,2005 %Change December 31,2004 %Change December 31,2003 Annual database queries 57.4 billion 21 % 47.3 billion 44 % 32.8 billion We expect Communications Services Group revenues to decrease in the first quarter of 2006 principally as a result of continued declines in the number of subscribers in our content business. Network Solutions We completed the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business on November 25, 2003 and recognized no revenues from this segment in 2005 or 2004. We will not recognize any revenue from the Network Solutions business in the future, other than revenues that may be recognized in connection with registry or other services we may provide to Network Solutions as a customer. 49 Table of Contents Revenues by Geographic Region Our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The following table shows a comparison of our continuing revenues by geographic region for each year presented: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Americas: United States $ 1,012,486 $ 796,123 $ 904,478 Other (1) 25,213 19,734 13,080 Total Americas 1,037,699 815,857 917,558 EMEA (2) 473,188 237,310 48,217 APAC (3) 98,607 65,139 51,570 Total revenues $ 1,609,494 $ 1,118,306 $ 1,017,345 (1) Canada, Latin America and South America (2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (3) Australia, Japan and Asia Pacific (APAC) Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Revenues increased approximately $221.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the increase in domain names ending in .com and .net under management coupled with an increase in the installed base of website digital certificates. Revenues in our EMEA region increased approximately $235.9 million primarily due to recognizing a full year of revenue from our content business in the region coupled with strong growth in our content business in the first half of 2005. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $33.5 million was attributed to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security services revenue in Japan. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Revenues decreased $101.7 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the sale of Network Solutions in November 2003. Revenues in our EMEA region increased $189.1 million in the same period primarily due to the acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004, which contributed revenues of approximately $180.8 million in 2004. In addition, increases in our web certificate and managed PKI sales in EMEA also contributed to the increase, partially offset by decreases in our VeriSign Affiliate revenues as we continued to move to a direct distribution model through international subsidiaries in certain larger European markets. The increase in APAC revenues of $13.6 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily related to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia, partially offset by a decrease in VeriSign Affiliate revenues. We expect international revenues will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2006 primarily due to an anticipated decline in content revenues in the EMEA region. Cost of revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of content licensing costs, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP based networks, costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services, billing services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, operational costs related to the management and monitoring of our clients network security infrastructures, and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities. We anticipate that our overall cost of revenues will increase in 2006, but that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will stay flat or decrease modestly in 2006 primarily due to greater cost efficiencies from our current businesses and recently acquired businesses. 50 Table of Contents A comparison of cost of revenues and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below. 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 512,225 17 % $ 436,016 (1 )% $ 439,152 Percentage of revenues 32 % 39 % 43 % Employee headcount 1,807 24 % 1,452 35 % 1,078 Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Cost of revenues increased approximately $76.2 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $35.6 million in salary and employee benefit costs from increased headcount related to content services and acquisitions. Contract and professional services increased approximately $25.5 million in 2005, due to increased third party customer care services, consulting costs for billing services and service development costs for prepaid services. Retailer commissions related to content services increased approximately $7.4 million over 2004. Other increases in cost of revenues were related to cost of maintenance of equipment and software. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily from leveraging our existing capital equipment and service delivery platforms. Overall depreciation expense on our new and existing equipment was unchanged in 2005 as compared to 2004. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Cost of revenues decreased approximately $3.1 million primarily due a decrease of $69.5 million as a result of the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was offset by increases attributable to the acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent of $49.8 million and $15.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of the Network Solutions domain name registrar business, which was a business with higher costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue than our other business segments. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs. We expect overall sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues to decrease as we expect to optimize our advertising expenses in certain countries for our content services. Efforts in marketing new products such as Unified Authentication and related services will continue in the first quarter of 2006. A comparison of sales and marketing expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below. 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 480,543 99 % $ 241,747 29 % $ 187,334 Percentage of revenues 30 % 22 % 18 % Employee headcount 763 16 % 656 29 % 510 51 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $238.8 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $204.1 million relating to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses for our content and application services business. Salary and employee benefits increased approximately $30.0 million due to an increase in overall sales and marketing headcount. Increase in corporate brand advertising, including the re launch of our brand, and corporate marketing amounted for approximately $4.4 million. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing spending in our content and application services business in 2005 as compared to 2004. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $54.4 million primarily due to our acquisitions of Jamba! and Guardent, which had sales and marketing expenses of $80.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a decrease of $38.3 million in sales and marketing expenses due to the sale of our Network Solutions domain name registrar business. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $7.1 million in advertising and marketing costs during this period primarily as a result of increased corporate brand advertising. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses increased in 2004 due to the increase in advertising and marketing spending, as described above. Research and development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development. We believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development. As a result, we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and increase modestly as a percentage of revenues in 2006. A comparison of research and development expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below. 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Research and development 95,339 58 % $ 60,405 22 % $ 49,408 Percentage of revenues 6 % 5 % 5 % Employee headcount 801 96 % 408 67 % 245 Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Research and development expenses increased approximately $34.9 million primarily due to an increase in headcount from our acquisitions, resulting in an increase of approximately $26.5 million in salary and employee related benefit costs. Other increases included approximately $3.3 million in occupancy related costs related to acquisitions and approximately $2.0 million of costs related to outside services. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2005 compared to 2004. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Research and development expenses increased $11.0 million primarily due to our acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba!. Research and development spending attributable to these acquired entities was $3.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The sale of our Network Solutions 52 Table of Contents business had no material effect on our research and development expense. Additionally, we experienced an increase of approximately $4.1 million in increased costs associated with contract and professional services to support new and existing research and development efforts. As a percentage of revenues, research and development expenses increased due to the increase in overall spending in 2004 as compared to 2003. General and administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees and bad debt expense. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses in 2006 will increase marginally in absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall revenues. A comparison of general and administrative expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below. 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) General and administrative 194,597 19 % $ 164,029 (5 )% $ 173,094 Percentage of revenues 12 % 15 % 17 % Employee headcount 705 24 % 567 11 % 513 Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: General and administrative expenses increased approximately $30.6 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $18.4 million in salary and employee benefit costs as a result of increased headcount. Equipment and software related expenses increased approximately $7.4 million, primarily due to an increase in hardware maintenance costs, software licenses and depreciation expense. Legal costs increased approximately $3.1 million primarily due to litigation settlements during the year. Contract and professional services increased approximately $3.1 million primarily due to services related to audit, tax and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other corporate expenses. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to increased revenues from our content services business, which has lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than other businesses, coupled with our ability to leverage existing general and administrative costs. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $9.1 million, primarily due to a decrease of $9.8 million attributable to the sale of our Network Solutions business, partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses from our acquisitions. Excluding the effects of the acquisitions of Guardent and Jamba! and the sale of our Network Solutions business, the overall decrease in general and administrative costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 was $13.3 million. This was primarily due to a reduction in costs from prior restructuring efforts of approximately $20.8 million, along with other efficiencies from cost reduction efforts of $5.6 million and a decrease in our bad debt expense of approximately $5.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in legal expenses of approximately $11.0 million as a result of costs associated with litigation, and increases in contract and professional services of approximately $7.5 million primarily due to expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2004 as described above. 53 Table of Contents The following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense and our days sales outstanding (DSO) for 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Bad debt expense $1,041 51 % $472 (86)% $4,826 DSO 45 days 1 day 44 days 5 days 39 days DSO increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of our acquisition of Jamba! in June 2004. We expect that DSO will be in the range of 40 to 50 days throughout 2006. Restructuring and Other Charges Below is a comparison of the restructuring and other charges for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) 2003 Restructuring Plan (reversals) charges $ (1,941 ) $ 4,973 $ 54,152 2002 Restructuring Plan (reversals) charges 1,363 (265 ) 20,481 Other charges 21,631 20,072 Total restructuring and other charges $ 21,053 $ 24,780 $ 74,633 The changes in restructuring and other charges are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives. 2003 Restructuring Plan. In 2003, we announced a restructuring initiative related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately $54.2 million. During 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.7 million related to non cancelable lease costs for excess facilities, $1.1 million related to workforce reduction charges, $1.0 million for exit costs and $0.2 million for other charges relating to property and equipment write offs. During 2005, we recorded reversals to excess facilities of approximately $1.9 million relating to certain operating leases. 2002 Restructuring Plan. In 2002, we announced plans to restructure our operations to rationalize, integrate and align resources. In 2003, we recorded other charges of $9.2 million related to the write off of certain computer software. We also recorded restructuring charges of $8.7 million related to non cancelable lease costs for excess facilities, $1.5 million related to workforce reduction charges and $1.0 million of exit costs. In 2005, we recorded charges of approximately $1.4 million relating to excess facilities that were either abandoned or downsized due to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs. Other charges. During 2004, we recorded other charges of approximately $20.1 million relating to certain asset write offs. During 2005, we abandoned the development efforts related to an internally developed software project and recorded an expense of approximately $21.6 million to other charges. Amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets Below is a comparison of our amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Impairment of goodwill $ $ $ 81,885 Impairment of other intangible assets 71,534 Amortization of other intangible assets 101,638 79,440 181,736 Total amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 101,638 $ 79,440 $ 335,155 54 Table of Contents SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. SFAS No. 144 requires that long lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset. There was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted in June 2005 and 2004. The annual impairment test conducted in June 2003 resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of $123.2 million during the second quarter of 2003. We recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2003 as a result of entering into an agreement to sell our Network Solutions business. The event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to Network Solutions. After considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of Network Solutions goodwill. Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as allocated to our operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2003 are as follows: Internet ServicesGroup CommunicationsServices Group NetworkSolutions TotalSegments (In thousands) Impairment of goodwill $ 18,697 $ 20,034 $ 43,154 $ 81,885 Impairment of other intangible assets: Technology in place 27,499 27,499 Customer lists 44,035 44,035 Total impairment of other intangible assets 71,534 71,534 Total impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets $ 18,697 $ 91,568 $ 43,154 $ 153,419 Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $22.2 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of Jamba! in June of 2004 and amortization expense related to our acquisition of LightSurf in April of 2005. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from Jamba! accounted for approximately $10.2 million of the increase. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from LightSurf accounted for approximately $8.8 million of the increase. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Amortization of other intangible assets decreased approximately $102.3 million as other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized. See Notes 1 and 7 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Acquired in process research and development During 2005, we wrote off $7.7 million of in process research and development acquired in the purchase of LightSurf, iDefense, Moreover and RSI. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPR&D efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies. Minority interest Minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries. 55 Table of Contents A comparison of minority interest for the years ended December 31 2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below: 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Minority interest $ 4,702 80 % $ 2,618 452 % $ 474 Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the installed base of website security certificates and increased demand for managed security services in Japan. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Minority interest increased in primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary. In June 2004, we acquired the remaining 49% minority interest in VeriSign Australia, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary. Other income (expense), net Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses. The following table presents the components of other income, net for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 %Change 2004 %Change 2003 Interest income $ 30,041 64 % $ 18,325 132 % $ 7,905 Net gain (impairment) on sale of investments, net of impairments (gains) 11,310 238 % (8,200 ) 50 % (16,541 ) Gain on sale of VeriSign Japan stock (100 )% 74,925 Other, net 10,155 2,961 % (355 ) (143 )% 833 Total other income, net 51,506 (39 )% 84,695 1,185 % (7,803 ) Fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004: Other income decreased approximately $33.2 million primarily due to the gain on sale of VeriSign Japan of approximately $74.9 million recorded in 2004, partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments, net of losses and impairments, in 2005, of approximately $19.5 million. Interest income increased $11.7 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances and slightly higher interest rates during 2005. In addition, we recorded a gain of approximately $6.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute with a telecommunications carrier customer during 2005. Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003: Other income increased approximately $92.5 million primarily due to the gain on sale of VeriSign Japan. Interest income increased approximately $10.4 million primarily due to higher cash balances. Income tax expense In the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of $104.7 million, or 43.0% of pretax income, $20.4 million, or 10.5% of pretax income, and $18.2 million, or (7.3)% of pretax loss, respectively. Our effective tax rates differ from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state taxes, acquisition related expenses, the realization of domestic net operating loss, capital loss, and research credit carryforwards, and the impact of foreign operations. 56 Table of Contents In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors, including our past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. federal and state operations are realizable. However, depending on our continued ability to achieve profitability, and on the potential impact of SFAS 123R, we may have sufficient evidence in 2006 to conclude that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus realize a tax benefit in that period from a reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. If the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of December 31, 2005, approximately $237.7 million would be credited to the statement of operations, and $101.2 million would be credited to additional paid in capital. Management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of $55.8 million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write down of investments, due to the limited carryover life and character of such tax attributes. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that $8.3 million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable; therefore, a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset. On the remaining foreign operations, management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized; accordingly, a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets. As of December 31, 2005, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $231.4 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $242.5 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.1 million. If we are not able to use them, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2010 through 2023 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2006 through 2023. Most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary. We had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately $7.0 million available for carryover to future years, and for state income tax purposes of approximately $3.8 million available for carryover to future years. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2025. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003 and 2002. These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize U.S. Federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward, but are subject to the expiration dates described in the prior paragraph. In the consolidated balance sheets, we have not included deferred tax assets of $151.1 million for a capital loss carryforward, and $67.0 million for a net operating loss generated by stock options. The capital loss and the net operating loss generated by the stock options are each subject to a ruling request currently on file with the IRS and will be allowed if and when we receive a favorable ruling. If the IRS issues favorable rulings to us, the deferred tax assets could be recognized and, if recognized, the $151.1 million will be credited to income tax expense and the $67.0 million will be credited to additional paid in capital. The outcome of these ruling requests is uncertain as the rulings are solely dependent on the IRS discretion. 57 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 476,826 $ 328,842 $ 298,472 Short term investments 378,006 406,784 422,093 Subtotal $ 854,832 $ 735,626 $ 720,565 Restricted cash and investments 50,972 51,518 18,371 Total $ 905,804 $ 787,144 $ 738,936 Working capital from continuing operations $ 291,669 $ 309,151 $ 325,523 At December 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was $854.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $510.8 million in 2005 primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items such as amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property and equipment. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $72.8 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $100.3 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $63.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $365.3 million in 2004 primarily due to an overall increase in net income after adjustments for non cash items such as amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property and equipment. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to an increase in deferred revenues of $69.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $44.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $65.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $358.4 million in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable of $38.1 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $28.0 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $25.5 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12.8 million after accounting for the sale of our Network Solutions business. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $113.9 million in 2005, primarily as a result of net proceeds of $367.2 million from the sale of our payment gateway business, partially offset by $161.3 million used for our acquisitions and $140.5 million for purchases of capital equipment. Other increases in cash were from net proceeds of investments of approximately $37.0 million and a $16.0 million payment on a long term note receivable. Net cash used in investing activities was $284.9 million in 2004, primarily as a result of $253.8 million used for our acquisitions and $15.9 million used for net purchases of investments. In addition, we used approximately $92.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $78.3 million in proceeds from the sale of stock in our VeriSign Japan subsidiary. Net cash used in investing activities was $368.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of $292.8 million used for net purchases of investments, $108.0 million for purchases of property and equipment, and $21.2 million for our acquisitions. These purchases were partially offset by proceeds of $57.6 million of cash received from the sale of our Network Solutions subsidiary in November 2003. 58 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $469.5 million in 2005 primarily due to $548.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset by $80.5 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. Net cash used in financing activities was $54.5 million in 2004 primarily due to $113.3 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market under an existing repurchase program, partially offset by $62.4 million provided by the proceeds from issuance of common stock from option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $55.9 million in 2003 primarily due to $37.4 million of cash was provided as a result of VeriSign Japans initial public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter of 2003 and through subsequent option exercises. Additionally, in 2003, $31.7 million was provided by common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises and proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan partially offset by $13.2 million for the repayment of debt and other long term obligations. Net cash provided by discontinued operations Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was primarily from net income related to our discontinued payment gateway business of $16.1 million, $12.6 million and $8.0 million respectively. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily for purchases of property and equipment. Capital property and equipment expenditures The following table shows our budgeted capital property and equipment expenditures in 2006 and our actual expenditures in 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2006Budgeted 2005Actual 2004Actual 2003Actual (In thousands) Capital property and equipment expenditures $ 140,000 $ 140,499 $ 91,002 $ 105,045 Our planned capital property and equipment expenditures for 2006 are anticipated to be approximately $140.0 million and will primarily be for computer and communications equipment and computer software within all areas of the Company. Our most significant expenditures will be focused on productivity, cost improvement and market development initiatives for the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Other capital property and equipment expenditures will be for productivity and cost improvement initiatives for corporate services. 59 Table of Contents Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our significant non cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 13 years 35 years More than5 years Contractual obligations (In thousands) Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income $ 156,377 $ 30,193 $ 51,616 $ 42,100 $ 32,468 Purchase obligations 69,750 27,200 42,300 250 Other long term liabilities 6,200 2,200 4,000 Total $ 232,326 $ 59,593 $ 97,915 $ 42,350 $ 32,468 As of December 31, 2005, we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess facilities included in our restructuring plans. The restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2014. If sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets, or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional $19.2 million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans. Cash payments totaling approximately $39.6 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next nine years. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cost savings resulting from our restructuring plans, not including other cost savings efforts, were estimated to have been approximately $25 to $30 million in 2005 and are estimated to be approximately the same in 2006. In November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu Internet top level domain, .tv with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $6.2 million through 2008. We have pledged a portion of our short term investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. We have pledged approximately $6.0 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash and investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of $45.0 million classified as restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability self insurance coverage. To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. On November 21, 2005, we entered into a $250 million ASR agreement with a large investment bank. Under the ASR agreement, we purchased approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of approximately $23.14. On August 2, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to use up to $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, 16,495,224 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $380.3 million. At December 31, 2005, approximately $119.7 million remained available for future repurchases under this program. 60 Table of Contents In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $350 million to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. During 2005, 6,322,203 shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $167.0 million. We completed the 2001 stock repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005. In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement. If we liquidated certain available for sale investments as of December 31, 2005, we would have recognized losses of approximately $5.4 million in our statement of operations. Instead, these unrecognized losses, partially offset by unrecognized gains, are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe existing cash and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006 and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Stock Compensation Plans and Unearned Compensation in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share amounts, for 2003 through 2005, as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109 1 (FSP 109 1), Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The AJCA introduces a special 9% tax deduction on qualified production activities. FAS 109 1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS 109. Pursuant to the AJCA, we will not be able to claim this tax benefit until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 109 2 (FSP 109 2), Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004. The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109 2 provides accounting and 61 Table of Contents disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (SFAS 154), Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The impact that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on our results of operations and financial position will depend on the nature of future accounting changes adopted by VeriSign and the nature of transitional guidance provided in future accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Equity investments We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized impairments totaling $0.8 million, $12.6 million, and $17.0 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments. Interest rate sensitivity The primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns. Some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value. To minimize interest rate risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents, short term investments and long term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, medium term notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of December 31, 2005, 45% of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at December 31, 2005, this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio. 62 Table of Contents The following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2005. This table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk.

As we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2005, we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately $173.2 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions. 63 Table of Contents
