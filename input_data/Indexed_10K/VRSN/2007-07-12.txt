ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Except for historical information, this Report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our anticipated costs and expenses and revenue mix. Forward looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words expects, anticipates, intends, believes and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors. You should carefully review the risks described in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q or Current Reports on Form 8 K that we file in 2007. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document. In this Form 10 K, we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We are also restating the unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of 2005, and the unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006. The decision to restate was based on the results of an independent review into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of an ad hoc group of our independent directors who had not served on our Compensation Committee before 2005 (Ad Hoc Group). As part of the restatement, we have also made adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 to correct errors identified for these fiscal years, which were not material to our financial statements in the aggregate or for any prior fiscal year. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10 K and quarterly reports on Form 10 Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon. We first learned of the potential issues associated with our past stock option grants from a May 16, 2006 article published by the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA) in which we were referenced as one of 15 public companies with one or two stock grants between 1997 and 2002 that the CFRA suggested were timed at, or close to, 40 day lows in the applicable companys stock price or preceding a material change in our stock price. Promptly after learning of the CFRA article, and prior to receiving the grand jury subpoena or the informal SEC request described below, the Ad Hoc Group, with the assistance of independent outside counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (Cleary Gottlieb), began reviewing the facts and circumstances of the timing of our historical stock option grants for the period January 1998 to May 2006 (relevant period). We believe that the analysis was properly limited to the relevant period. In addition to Cleary Gottlieb, the Ad Hoc Group was assisted in its Review by independent forensic accountants (collectively the Review Team). On June 27, 2006, we announced that we had received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents relating to our stock option grants and practices dating back to January 1, 1995, and had received an informal request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to our stock option grants and practices. On February 9, 2007, we subsequently received a formal order of investigation from the SEC. We are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorneys investigation and the SEC investigation. 59 Table of Contents On November 21, 2006, we announced that the Ad Hoc Group had determined the need to restate our historical financial statements to record additional non cash, stock based compensation expense related to past stock option grants. On March 30, 2007, we requested guidance from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC (the OCA) concerning certain accounting issues relating to the restatement of our historical financials and the Review. On June 25, 2007, we concluded our discussions with the OCA regarding these accounting issues. On May 29, 2007, we announced that Stratton Sclavos, our then current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had resigned from his position with VeriSign. Following Mr. Sclavos resignation, the Board elected director William A. Roper, Jr. as our President and CEO and Edward Mueller as our Chairman of the Board of Directors. On July 10, 2007, Dana L. Evan, our then current Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer, resigned from her position with VeriSign. On July 5, 2007 and July 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Albert E. Clement Chief Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, respectively of the Company. The Review Team tested grants made on 239 dates, incurred 21,800 person hours, searched more than 11 million pages of physical and electronic documents and conducted 75 interviews of 33 current and former directors, officers, employees, and advisors. We announced on January 31, 2007 that the Ad Hoc Groups Review was substantially completed and that, based on a review of the totality of evidence and the applicable law, the Review did not find intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the senior management team or the former CEO. The Ad Hoc Groups Review concluded that we failed to implement appropriate processes and controls for granting, accounting for, and reporting stock option grants and that corporate records in certain circumstances were incomplete or inaccurate. The Review Team examined all grants to Section 16 officers and directors during the relevant period, as well as 7 annual performance grants to rank and file employees and 179 acquisition, new hire and promotion, and other grants to rank and file employees on 239 dates from January 1998 through January 2006. The Review Team identified 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during the relevant period for which measurement dates were incorrectly determined. The measurement dates required revision because the stated date either preceded or was subsequent to the proper measurement date and the stock price on the stated date was generally lower than the price on the proper measurement date. In several instances, the Review Team also determined that the stock price assigned on the initial grant dates was subsequently modified, without being given the required accounting and disclosure treatment. Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, as part of the restatement, the grants during the relevant period were organized into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized. The evidence related to each category of grant was analyzed including, but not limited to, electronic and physical documents, document metadata, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, and consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC, the controlling accounting standards were applied to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock based compensation expense and related income tax effects. 60 Table of Contents Measurement Date Hierarchy We have adopted the following framework for determining the measurement dates of our stock option grants and have applied this framework to each grant based on the facts, circumstances and availability of documentation. We reviewed the date of the minutes of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings for grants made at such meetings when the number of options and exercise price for each recipient had been clearly approved. Where the Review Team determined that the meeting date was not the measurement date, the Review Team determined the actual date of approval of the grant via other documentary evidence and interviews. When a grant was approved by unanimous written consent (UWC), the measurement date was the date of the Compensation Committees approval of the UWC as established by available evidence, such as receipt of signature pages of the UWC, contemporaneous telephone and or e mail communications. If a grant was approved by the CEO under authority delegated by the Compensation Committee, the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval to the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. If a grant was approved by the CEO based on the mistaken belief that he had delegated authority to do so (de facto or substantive authority), the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. In the event the date on which the CEO communicated approval was not evident from the approval forms, the measurement date was the date on which other available evidence, such as the surrounding e mail communications, established the date the CEO approved the grant. In the event the date of CEO approval could not be established by reviewing other available evidence, such as e mails, the measurement date was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into our option tracking database (Equity Edge). Except for grants to Section 16 officers which require Compensation Committee approval, for new hire grants and promotion grants, prior to March 13, 1998, the measurement date was the date the Compensation Committee approved the grant (as described above). For new hire grants and promotion grants after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and after September 30, 2002, the measurement date was the 15th day or the last day of the month (or the prior business day if that day was not a business day) following the actual and documented start date or promotion date of the respective employee receiving the grant. New hire grants and promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval. For new hire grants and promotion grants in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002, the measurement date was the date on which the CEO communicated approval to either the Human Resources Department, the Compensation Committee or the respective employees indicating final approval of both the number of options and exercise price. If that date could not be determined, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. After determining the measurement date through the steps in the above Measurement Date Hierarchy, we then determined if there were any changes to the individual recipients, exercise prices or amount of shares granted after such measurement date. If there were no changes following such measurement date, then that date would be used. If we identified changes following such measurement date, then we would evaluate whether the changes should delay the measurement date for the entire list of grants on that date, result in a repricing, or result in separate accounting for specific grants. 61 Table of Contents Director Grants Required Granting Actions: Grants to directors under the 1998 Director Plan (the Director Plan) were automatic and non discretionary; the Director Plan did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee to review or approve director grants. Each new director received an initial grant of a specified number of options on the date of his or her appointment and annually on the anniversary of the initial grant to be priced on the appointment or anniversary date, respectively. Directors serving before the Director Plan was adopted received an annual grant on the anniversary of their previous grant. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: For the initial grant, the measurement date was the date the director was appointed to the Board, as reflected in Board minutes. In the absence of Board minutes, the date specified in the proxy statement or, if not clear, the date of the first Board meeting attended by the new director. For anniversary grants, annually on the date of the initial grant (or the next business day if such date was not a business day). Executive Grants Required Granting Actions: The Compensation Committee is required to approve all grants to executive officers. For grants to the former CEO, the Review Team concluded that, in all but three cases (including the February 2002 grant described below), the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors approved the grant on the stated grant date, resulting in a correct measurement date. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: For grants other than the February/May 2002 grant described below, including the other two grants to the former CEO referred to above, please refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above. Acquisition Grants Required Granting Actions: CEO authorization required. The Board of Directors implicitly delegated to the CEO authority to approve grants to employees from acquisitions when the Board approved an acquisition. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above. Annual Refresh Grants Required Granting Actions: The Compensation Committee was required to approve all annual refresh grants through and including the 2004 annual refresh grant. In 2005, the Compensation Committee delegated to the CEO the authority to approve rank and file annual refresh grants. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above. Extended Grants Required Granting Actions: The Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors is required to approve all extensions of grants. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: Extended grants are a modification of a previous award. Available documentation was used to establish the modification date and to measure the additional compensation charge. Retention and Off Cycle Grants Required Granting Actions: The Compensation Committee is required to approve all retention and off cycle grants. 62 Table of Contents Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: Refer to the Documentation Hierarchy above. For the February/May 2002 retention grant described below, the former CEO approved the grants to rank and file employees. New Hire and Promotion Grants Required Granting Actions: New hire grants and promotion grants made after March 13, 1998 and prior to September 2000 and those made after September 30, 2002 were automatic and did not require the CEO, the Board or the Compensation Committee review or approval. Prior to March 13, 1998, the Compensation Committee was required to approve all new hire and promotion grants. New hire grants and promotion grants made in the period September 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002 required CEO approval. Method for Determining Proper Measurement Dates: Refer to the Measurement Date Hierarchy above. The 8,164 grants previously identified as having incorrectly determined measurement dates were classified into the following six categories: (1) 27 grants on 11 dates to persons elected or appointed as members of the Board of Directors (Director Grants); (2) 33 grants to executive officers (Executive Grants); (3) 2,908 grants to employees issued after an acquisition, newly hired employees and promoted employees under the new hire and promotion grants program described below (New Hire and Promotion Grants Program), and other grants to a large number of non executives; (4) 4,226 grants made in broad based awards to large numbers of employees, usually on an annual basis (Annual Refresh Grants); (5) 964 off cycle performance grants; and (6) 6 grants whereby the expiration dates were extended (Extended Grants). All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices have been adjusted for all subsequent stock splits. As discussed below, it was determined that the originally assigned grant dates for 8,164 grants were not ascribed the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes. Accordingly, after accounting for forfeitures, stock based compensation expense of $171.4 million on a pre tax basis was recognized over the respective awards vesting terms for the periods from 1998 to 2006. As noted below, we also considered alternative measurement dates for eight grant dates which, if applied, would have resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately $25.7 million. The adjustments made to reflect the proper measurement dates for accounting purposes and the financial statement impact of the alternative measurement dates considered by us, were determined by category as follows: Director Grants: 64 director grants were made on 36 dates during the relevant period. Of the 64 grants, there were 27 grants to directors for which it was determined that the originally determined grant dates preceded or succeeded the measurement dates, 11 grants were in excess of plan parameters, and some of the dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 27 grants with measurement date issues, 26 of the grants involved periods of 5 days or less and resulted in a stock based compensation expense of less than $100,000 in the aggregate. Revisions to measurement dates for director grants were made where the wrong date was selected based on the requirements of the Director Plan and where incorrect start dates were used for the date the director joined the Board of Directors. The excess grants have been historically honored by us. As a result, $0.3 million of stock based compensation expense was recognized. Executive Officer Grants: It was determined that for 33 of the grants to executive officers, the originally determined grant dates preceded the measurement dates or the grant dates and exercise prices were subsequently changed. Some of these dates were selected in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. As the stock prices on the originally determined grant dates were lower than the stock prices on the proper measurement date, $28.1 million of stock based compensation expense was recognized. The revised measurement dates for various executive officer grants were based on Compensation Committee meeting dates, signed UWCs, delayed CEO approval, and for one date the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. We also considered an alternative measurement date for one grant date which would have increased the compensation expense by approximately $130,000 for that grant. The authority for 21 grants, which have been historically honored by us, is based on the CEOs presumed authority. 63 Table of Contents New Hire and Promotion Grants Program: We concluded that the new hire and promotion grants made pursuant to the New Hire and Promotion Grants Program within the pre established guidelines did not require an adjustment, with the exception of the grants made from September 1, 2000 to September 30, 2002. For the 1,728 grants made during that time period, management concluded that the measurement dates occurred only on the dates of the CEO approval. Due to practical difficulties in ascertaining the actual dates of the CEO approval for many new hire and promotion grants in that time period, the measurement date was based on the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. The incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the New Hire and Promotion Grants during the relevant period was $11.9 million. Acquisition Grants: After the consummation of certain acquisitions, we granted stock options to employees of the acquired entities. It was determined that the measurement dates for 1,180 option grants required revision because the stated grant dates preceded the proper measurement dates and the approval authority was based on CEO approval. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price. Of the 1,180 grants, 1,048 grants were extinguished as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. Due to issues associated with the measurement dates for the acquisition grants, $36.2 million of additional stock based compensation expense was recognized during the relevant period. We also considered an alternative measurement date for three different acquisition grant dates which, if they had been used, would have increased the compensation expense by approximately $675,000. Annual Refresh Grants: During the relevant period, 3,782 broad based grants were made to employees under an annual program (the Refresh Grants) for which the originally assigned grant dates were not the proper measurement dates. Some of these dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the authority for some of the Refresh Grants was the CEOs presumed authority. For one of the annual Refresh Grants which occurred in August 2000, there was conflicting documentation and inconclusive evidence with respect to the measurement date. It was determined that the most appropriate measurement date, due to the lack of affirmative evidence otherwise, was the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge, and based on that date, $19.2 million of stock based compensation expense was recognized in the period 2000 to 2002. These grants were extinguished in December 2002 as part of our exchange program which commenced in November 2002. We did not approve or process any stock option grants to existing employees during the period of the tender offer or agree or imply that we would compensate employees for any increases in the market price during the tender period. The Review also determined that the annual refresh grants for the years 1999, 2001, 2004, and a portion of the 2003 grant had a measurement date that was later than the date that was originally used. In these cases, where the measurement dates were revised, the authority for the grants varied and included new dates based on UWCs by the Compensation Committee or approvals by the CEO. Where approval was not determinable based on the above, we utilized the date on which the number of options and exercise price were entered into Equity Edge. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the annual refresh grants, stock based compensation expense of $55.1 million was recognized. We also considered alternative measurement dates for two refresh grants which did not create additional compensation charge where one alternative measurement date had a lower price than the original grant date and the options for the second alternative measurement date were cancelled prior to the one year cliff vesting date. Off Cycle Performance Grants: There were 964 performance grants made to employees on March 15, 2001 and October 1, 2003. These dates were chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, and the authority for these grants was the CEOs de facto authority. The revised measurement dates were based on the dates of the UWC for the March 15, 2001 grant and e mail correspondence for the October 1, 2003 grant. Due to the errors in measurement dates associated with the off cycle performance grants, stock based compensation expense of $5.6 million was recognized. We also considered an alternative measurement date for the October 1, 2003 grant which, if it had been used, would have decreased the compensation expense by approximately $100,000 for that grant. Extended Grants: During the relevant period, there were 6 stock option extensions (including one to the former CEO described below) whereby an option was extended beyond its expiration or termination date and for 64 Table of Contents which a compensation charge had not been recorded. As a result, $2.1 million of stock based compensation expense was recognized. The former CEO received certain options from Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) in his capacity as a NSI director prior to our acquisition of NSI. Upon receiving legal advice, management extended the term of those options beyond their original expiration date. The former CEO exercised those options on May 24, 2002. The Ad Hoc Group reviewed the extension of these options and determined that the legal advice was incorrect and that the options should not have been extended. Upon learning of this determination in January 2007, the former CEO voluntarily paid us $174,425, reflecting the after tax net profit he received from the exercise of those options. 2002 Retention Grants: Between February and May 2002, the Compensation Committee considered special option grants as a retention incentive for executive officers and other executives and key employees, since in many cases the exercise prices of options previously granted to these individuals were significantly above the then current market price for shares of our common stock. These retention grants are summarized as follows: Grants to Executive Officers and Other Executives: We determined that 68 grants of options for a total of 4,631,000 shares to executive officers and other executives were finalized on April 10, 2002 rather than the stated grant date of February 21, 2002. The Review Team was unable, after review of detailed documentation, including multiple draft versions of the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee minutes, approval forms (which were undated) and email correspondence, to affirmatively determine when the grants to executive officers and other executives were approved. In accordance with our measurement date hierarchy for grants described above, we determined that April 10, 2002 was the correct measurement date because that was the date that other grants, including certain executive grants, were entered into Equity Edge. The grant price as of the measurement date was $23.74, the closing market price of our stock on April 10, 2002. Because the stated exercise price of the grants was set based on the closing market price on February 21, 2002 of $22.71 and preceded the measurement date, an incremental $1.3 million of stock based compensation expense was recognized. We also determined that the Compensation Committee repriced 1,870,000 of these options on May 24, 2002, with an exercise price of $10.08, the closing market price of our stock on May 24, 2002. We determined that these grants were a reprice based on a UWC of the Compensation Committee. The accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. In accordance with FIN 44 and after applying variable accounting, we recognized incremental stock based compensation expense of approximately $15.8 million, net of reversals, for the periods between 2002 and 2006. Had we considered an alternative measurement date between the periods from February 13, 2002 through April 25, 2002, compensation expense would have increased by up to $25.0 million for these grants. Grants to Employees: Broad based employee grants were also considered during the February to May 2002 period. The Review Team determined that the CEO, under his presumed authority, approved 305 broad based employee grants on or about March 20, 2002 with a grant price of $26.42, the closing market price of our stock on that date. These awards were communicated shortly thereafter to the employees. We determined that March 20, 2002 was a definitive measurement date for the awards to the employees. The grants to employees previously approved by the CEO on March 20, 2002 were submitted for approval to the Compensation Committee as evidenced in a UWC dated May 24, 2002. The Compensation Committee approved the 305 employee grants with an exercise price of $10.08, the market value of our common stock on May 24, 2002. Therefore the employee awards were re priced on that date. Although the awards had been communicated to the employees and disclosed in our Form 10 Q for the first quarter of 2002, the accounting impact of the repricing was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $6.6 million, net of reversals of additional stock based compensation expense, has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006. 65 Table of Contents Retention Grants to our former CEO: In the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting, the Committee considered the number and vesting period of a proposed option award to the CEO. The Review Team found multiple draft versions of the minutes for the February 12, 2002 meeting of the Compensation Committee and concluded that the signed minutes were inaccurate. Attendees at the meeting have different recollections of the business conducted. One draft, unapproved version of those minutes, stated the number of options to be awarded to the CEO was 1,200,000, while the signed version of the minutes approved by the members of the Compensation Committee in late May 2002 stated that the number of options to be awarded was 600,000. Both versions of the minutes stated that the grant date and the exercise price was February 21, 2002 and $22.71. The minutes of a Board meeting held on February 12, 2002, after the Compensation Committee meeting, also indicate that the CEO was awarded 1,200,000 options at the February 12, 2002 Compensation Committee meeting. We have determined that the measurement date for the 1,200,000 options to the CEO was February 12, 2002 with a grant price of $26.31, the closing market price of our stock on that date, and that the options were repriced on February 21, 2002 with a grant price of $22.71, the closing market price of our stock on that date. Subsequently, 600,000 options of the 1,200,000 options were repriced on May 24, 2002 with a grant price of $10.08, the closing market price of our stock on that date. The accounting impact of the repricings was not recorded at the time of the Compensation Committee approval and we did not properly disclose the circumstances of these grants. As a result of the repricing, and after applying variable accounting, approximately $7.5 million, net of reversals, of additional stock based compensation expense has been recorded for the periods between 2002 and 2006. Actions Taken by the Board with respect to Grants: As part of the Review, the Board of Directors confirmed all option grants (including those to our former CEO and CFO) that the Review Team concluded had authority issues as legally binding and enforceable obligations of the Company as of the date of such grant. In addition, the Board of Directors decided to modify the following grants to the former CEO and CFO in 2007 and no reversal of compensation expense was recorded for these negative modifications in the financial statements. Former CEO: An option grant to the former CEO of 100,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31. Former CEO: The February 2002 option grant to the former CEO of 600,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $26.31. Former CFO: An option grant to the CFO of 25,000 shares originally dated December 29, 2000 at an exercise price of $74.188 was modified to a new exercise price of $127.31. Former CFO: An option grant to the CFO of 125,000 shares originally dated August 1, 2000 at an exercise price of $151.25 was modified to a new exercise price of $165.22. Former CFO: An option grant to the CFO of 40,000 shares originally dated March 15, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.44 was modified to a new exercise price of $42.26. The CFOs 409A tax election described below modified 1,667 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify the remaining 38,333 options. Former CFO: A grant to the CFO of 90,000 shares originally dated September 6, 2001 at an exercise price of $34.16 was modified to a new exercise price of $38.30. The CFOs 409A tax election described below modified 11,250 of these options and the Board of Directors determined to modify the remaining 78,750 options. Former CFO: The February 2002 option grant to the CFO of 100,000 shares originally dated February 21, 2002 at an exercise price of $22.71 was modified to a new exercise price of $23.74. Other: The Company and the Review Team also determined that the former CEO received an option grant in October 1998 for 100,000 shares (95,928 non qualified stock options (NQSOs) and 4,072 incentive stock 66 Table of Contents options (ISOs)), which split to options for 200,000 shares in May 1999 and then split again to options for 400,000 shares in November 1999 when we announced a stock split during those respective periods. The account statements and monthly reporting statements for November 1 and December 1, 2000 showed that the former CEO held options for 400,000 shares at the split adjusted price of $7.67. However, the Ad Hoc Group determined that sometime between December 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001, we erroneously changed the former CEOs options to reflect the pre split amount of 100,000 shares instead of 400,000 shares, but at the post split price of $7.67. The error was never subsequently corrected. Therefore, the former CEO did not receive the benefit of the additional 300,000 options arising from the two stock splits, which expired in 2005. Based on a determination by the Board of Directors after the Ad Hoc Groups Review in May 2007, we have agreed to pay the former CEO $5,459,430, reflecting the gain he would have realized from the exercise of these options prior to their expiration, based on the weighted average price of stock options exercised by the former CEO in August 2005. The other principal factual findings of the Review included the following: The human resources, accounting, and legal departments failed to implement appropriate processes and controls. During 2000 through 2003, the option grant process was characterized by a high degree of informality and relatively little oversight. The Review found no evidence that accounting personnel were aware of the deficient practices used in selecting grant dates. The Review found instances of incomplete and inaccurate corporate records, including two sets of Committee minutes that were inaccurate. The Review found no evidence of fictitious individuals being granted options. Options found to be misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, repriced, or unauthorized with a stated exercise price lower than the share price at the actual approval date will result in adverse tax consequences to the recipients and us. In light of the Reviews other findings, our disclosures related to option grants were inaccurate in some respects. The principal recommendations of the Ad Hoc Groups Review included the following: The Board or the Compensation Committee should approve all grants that the Review found to be unauthorized, with the exception of certain grants made to our former CEO and CFO. The Board or the Compensation Committee should consider whether to cancel or request forfeiture of any options granted to the former CEO and CFO that were determined to be unauthorized, misdated, have a date chosen in hindsight based on an advantageous share price, or repriced, and then should consider the appropriate equity compensation for these officers for the periods covered by the Review. We should develop and implement detailed written grant policies. We should designate individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of and accounting for option grants. We should develop and implement improved training and controls relating to option granting practices to ensure that all personnel involved in the granting and administration of stock options understand the relevant option plans and accounting, tax, and disclosure requirements. We should award regular grants (new hire, promotion, and annual performance) at predetermined dates and with all approvals documented and finalized on those dates. The Board has adopted all of the Reviews findings and recommendations. Under the direction of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and with the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing the recommendations. 67 Table of Contents Based on the results of the Review, we have recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense (benefit) net of related income tax effects related to past stock option grants of $1.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006, ($21.6) million and $36.9 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. These adjustments were recorded based on the evidence and findings from the Ad Hoc Groups review, including analysis of the measurement dates for the 8,164 stock option grants made on 41 dates during the relevant period that the Review determined were incorrect. The incremental impact from recognizing stock based compensation expense resulting from the Ad Hoc Groups Review of past stock option grants is as follows (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year As Restated As PreviouslyReported Pre Tax Expense (Income)Adjustments After Tax (Income)ExpenseAdjustments 1998 $ 1,288 $ 1,280 $ 8 $ 8 1999 7,057 104 6,953 6,953 2000 24,814 1,722 23,092 23,092 2001 42,500 7,803 34,697 34,697 2002 70,066 18,956 51,110 51,110 2003 35,010 7,389 27,621 27,621 Total 19982003 impact 180,735 37,254 143,481 143,481 2004 46,835 3,136 43,699 36,873 2005(2) (10,588 )(2) 6,312 (17,670 ) (21,560 ) 2006(1) 66,285 64,438 1,847 (1) 1,532 (1) Total $ 283,267 $ 111,140 $ 171,357 $ 160,326 (1) Pre tax expense adjustments are through March 31, 2006 and represents amounts being reported pursuant to FAS 123R whereas amounts for all other years represent amounts being reported pursuant to APB 25. (2) Includes $0.8 million of other stock based compensation adjustments that were unrelated to past stock option grants. Additionally, the pro forma expense under SFAS No. 123 in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10 K has been restated to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. As noted above we considered alternative measurement dates for eight grants which, if applied, would have resulted in additional stock based compensation of approximately $25.7 million. With the exception of these eight grants, there was no uncertainty on the measurement date for option grants. The table below shows what the incremental impact to stock based compensation expense would have been by category of grant had these alternative measurement dates been applied (in thousands): Category Pre Tax Expense (Income) Director Grants $ Executive Grants 100 Acquisition Grants 675 Annual Refresh Grants Extended Grants Retention and Off Cycle Grants (100 ) New Hire and Promotion Grants 2002 Retention Grants 25,000 Total $ 25,675 68 Table of Contents Tax Implications We evaluated the impact of the restatements on our global tax provision and have determined that a portion of the tax benefit relating to stock based compensation expense formerly associated with stock option deductions is attributable to continuing operations. We identified deferred tax assets totaling $16.3 million at December 31, 2005 which reflect the benefit of tax deductions from future employee stock option exercises. We have not realized this or any other deferred tax asset relating to taxing jurisdictions within the United States as of December 31, 2005. We also believe that we should not have taken a tax deduction under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m) in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to certain executives. Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, our tax net operating losses associated with the stock option intra period allocation have decreased by $12.6 million. We continue to apply a valuation allowance to our tax net operating losses relating to stock options exercised prior to the adoption of SFAS No.123R, Share Based Payment. Pursuant to Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, we recognize financial statement benefit of these tax net operating losses when such losses reduce cash taxes paid. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) imposes significant penalties on individual income taxpayers who were granted stock options that were unvested as of December 31, 2004 and that have an exercise price of less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant (Affected Options). These tax consequences include income tax at vesting, an additional 20% tax and interest charges. In addition, the issuer of Affected Options must comply with certain reporting and withholding obligations under Section 409A. These adverse tax consequences may be avoided for unexercised Affected Options if the exercise price of the Affected Option is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the time the option was granted (as such measurement date is determined for financial reporting purposes). Under Treasury regulations, Affected Options held by executive officers or directors were to be amended on or before December 31, 2006 to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A; holders of Affected Options who are not our executive officers or directors have until December 31, 2007 to amend their Affected Options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of Section 409A. Four of our current and former executive officers and a current director holding Affected Options elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options to the market price on December 31, 2006. Effective December 31, 2006, the exercise prices of Affected Options held by D. James Bidzos, a current board member, Dana Evan, former Chief Financial Officer, Robert Korzeniewski, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, Judy Lin, former Executive Vice President of Security Services and Mark McLaughlin, Executive Vice President of Products, Marketing and Customer Support, were adjusted so that these options will not be subject to Section 409A. We are currently considering actions to avoid or alleviate certain of the adverse tax consequences associated with Affected Options for employees who are not executive officers of the Company and whether to offer compensation to the executive officers and director who elected to increase the exercise price of their Affected Options as of December 31, 2006. Should we decide to take actions to avoid or alleviate these adverse tax consequences associated with current and former employees outstanding Affected Options, we estimate the related compensatory payments would be approximately $11.6 million. In June 2007, we made payments of approximately $0.9 million on behalf of current and former employees who exercised Affected Options in 2006 under the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board 409A Compliance Resolution Programs. We estimate the cost to participate in these Compliance Resolution Programs, including a gross up payment to the affected employees, will be approximately $1.9 million. Other Matters As part of the restatement, we made other adjustments to previously stated financial statements back to 2002. These adjustments include corrections to revenue, expenses, other income and related income tax adjustments. The adjustments mentioned below are in addition to the recognition of additional stock compensation expense resulting from the stock option investigation. 69 Table of Contents In 2002, we recorded a $2.7 million charge to stock compensation expense that was previously recorded in the first quarter of 2003. As part of our stock option investigation, we were required to record additional payroll tax expense for the periods affected by the restatement. Although the statute for such taxes is closed through 2003, we recorded the additional payroll tax as if the statute were open, and then reversed the accrual for payroll tax when the statute closed. We recorded additional immaterial expenses in 2002 and 2003 and reduced payroll tax expense by $4.0 million and $0.8 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively. As part of the 2003 restructuring activities, we had one significant leased property for which real estate taxes and utilities costs were not properly accounted for at the time of the restructuring. The adjustment resulted in an increase in accrued restructuring costs of $3.8 million in 2003. Approximately $1.5 million of this adjustment was later released in 2004 as part of the building was subleased to a third party and $2.3 million was released in 2005 when the remainder of the space was assumed by another tenant directly with the landlord. During 2004, we adjusted the interest amortization on the note receivable from Network Solutions. This item was the result of adjusting the interest rate on the loan to a market rate. It was determined that this adjustment would have increased other income in the fourth quarter of 2003 by $1.9 million. We originally booked the additional $1.9 million gain in 2004, which has since been reversed. As a part of our internal control processes during 2006, we detected an error related to the accounting for software maintenance amortization for various software license arrangements acquired from vendors. As a result of this error, we increased software maintenance expenses by $203,000 in 2004, $2.5 million in 2005 and $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2006. During 2006, we detected two errors related to the accounting at our Jamba subsidiary in Berlin, Germany. The first error relates to the accounting for insurance revenues recorded after Jamba was acquired. We did not properly account for insurance renewal premiums on contracts that were renewed after the acquisition. The second error relates to the timing of certain revenues, which were booked in incorrect periods. The combined impact of these errors increased revenues $2.3 million in 2004, $3.1 million in 2005 and $284,000 in the first quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, we reversed $1.1 million of revenue to account for billed services that were not delivered under contractual terms. The following table presents the impact of the other adjustments that are not related to the stock option investigation on consolidated selected financial data for the periods presented: Twelve Months Ended Three MonthsEnded December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 March 31,2006 (in thousands, except per share data) Increase (decrease) in revenues $ $ $ 2,289 $ 3,080 $ (786 ) Increase (decrease) in costs 2,706 914 (4,526 ) 213 936 (Decrease) increase in other income, net (304 ) 1,636 (1,175 ) (295 ) 79 Tax (benefit) expense 2,172 1,615 110 Change in net (loss) income $ (3,010 ) $ 722 $ 3,468 $ 957 $ (1,753 ) Change in net (loss) income per share, basic and diluted $ (0.01 ) $ $ 0.01 $ $ (0.01 ) 70 Table of Contents Business Overview In January 2007, we announced a new functional business structure that reorganizes the Internet Services Group (the ISG) and the Communications Services Group (the CSG) to deliver an integrated portfolio of products and services through a unified sales and services team across multiple industries.

In addition to the above, we also completed several other acquisitions during 2006, 2005 and 2004 that were not material on an individual basis or in the aggregate. We accounted for all of our significant acquisitions in 2006, 2005 and 2004 as business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations. Accordingly, the acquired companies revenues, costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition. See Note 3 Business Combinations of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our business acquisitions over the last three years. 72 Table of Contents Dispositions Payment Gateway Business Sale On November 18, 2005, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our payment gateway business to PayPal, Inc. and PayPal International Limited for $370 million in cash. This transaction was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144) and, accordingly, we have reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all periods to reflect this transaction. Domain Name Registrar Business On January 9, 2006, Network Solutions repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the Secured Senior Promissory Note dated November 25, 2003. In addition, Network Solutions redeemed our 15% equity interest in Network Solutions. We received approximately $47.8 million in total cash, which included the $26.5 million repayment of the note receivable and related interest and recognized a gain on investment of $21.3 million. As a result of the redemption of the membership interests, we no longer own equity interests in any Internet domain name registrars. VeriSign Japan K.K. On November 22, 2004, we sold 18,000 ordinary shares of our Tokyo based, majority owned consolidated subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K. (VeriSign Japan), representing approximately 7% of our ownership interest, for approximately $78 million. After giving effect to the sale, we continue to own a majority stake in VeriSign Japan equal to approximately 54% of VeriSign Japans total shares outstanding. Subsequent Events In January 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan to execute a company wide reorganization replacing the previous business unit structure with a new combined worldwide sales and services team, and an integrated development and products organization. The restructuring plan included workforce reductions, abandonment of excess facilities, disposals of property and equipment, and other charges. In the first quarter of 2007, we recorded approximately $26.9 million in restructuring charges. As of the date of the filing of this report, we are not in compliance with certain covenants under our Credit Agreement related to the $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility), as described in Note 10 Credit Facility in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, that require us to deliver specified financial statements, compliance certificates and certain other documents to our Lenders. The required Lenders under the Facility have waived our compliance with these requirements through July 13, 2007. On February 28, 2007, we repaid $199 million in loans representing the entire outstanding balance under our $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. On January 31, 2007, the Company and Fox Entertainment (Fox), a subsidiary of News Corporation, and various subsidiaries of our Company and Fox, finalized two joint venture agreements to provide mobile entertainment to consumers on a global basis. Under the terms of the agreements Fox (through a subsidiary) will own a 51% interest in the joint ventures, and we (through a subsidiary) will own a 49% interest in the joint ventures. One of the joint ventures, Netherlands Mobile Holdings, C.V., is based in the Netherlands, and the other is based in the United States. We contributed our Jamba business to consumer business to the Netherlands joint venture and Fox contributed its Fox Mobile Entertainment assets to the U.S. based joint venture. Fox paid us approximately $192.4 million in cash for its contribution of the Jamba business and we paid Fox approximately $4.9 million in cash for its contribution of Fox Mobile Entertainment assets 73 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2007, we decided to sell our wholly owned Jamba Services GmbH subsidiary. In accordance with SFAS 144, the associated assets and liabilities of Jamba Services GmbH will be classified as held for sale and its operations will be reported as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2007. On May 27, 2007, Stratton D. Sclavos, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors and member of our Board of Directors, resigned from his positions. Effective May 27, 2007, our Board of Directors appointed William A. Roper, Jr., to replace Mr. Sclavos as President and Chief Executive Officer, and elected Edward A. Mueller as Chairman of the Board of Directors. On July 5, 2007 and July 12, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Albert E. Clement as Chief Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, respectively of the Company. On July 10, 2007, Dana Evan, our then current Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Chief Financial Officer resigned from her position with VeriSign. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, long lived assets, restructuring and stock based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles. Revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided. Our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events. Revenues from consulting services are recognized either on a time and materials basis as the services are performed, or for fixed price consulting as services are performed, completed and accepted. In some cases fixed price consulting is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting. Proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project. We have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects. If different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made, then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed. Revenues from time and materials are recognized as services are performed. Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance 74 Table of Contents after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance, each customers expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer. We review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above. In addition, we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category. We require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate, but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future. As of December 31, 2006, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 2.4% of total accounts receivable, or approximately $8.1 million. A change of 1% in our estimate would amount to approximately $3.4 million. The following table shows a comparison of our bad debt expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Bad debt (recovery) expense $ (1,165 ) (212 )% $ 1,041 121 % $ 472 Valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles Our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment. We review, at least annually, goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We review long lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the assets carrying amount in accordance with SFAS 144. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset. Recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006, which was comprised of $1.5 billion of goodwill and $0.3 billion of other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include customer relationships, technology in place, carrier relationships, non compete agreements, trade names, and other. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired, an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made. If this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations, of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements. It is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill. Restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net In November 2003, we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our Network Solutions business and the realignment of other business units. In April 2002, we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully 75 Table of Contents rationalize, integrate and align our resources. Both plans resulted in reductions in workforce, abandonment of excess facilities, disposal of property and equipment and other charges. We expect these restructuring plans to be completed in 2008 upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities. Restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space, including the potential for sublease income. Estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented, the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property. These estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located, such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates. Changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis, as necessary. During 2006, we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately $6.4 million primarily related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations. Such estimates will likely be revised in the future. Stock based compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) SFAS 123R. We elected the modified prospective application method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified. For stock based awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, we will amortize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations. Expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. See Note 13 Stock Based Compensation of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. 76 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the selected information on our results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Cost and expenses: Cost of revenues 37 32 39 Sales and marketing 24 30 22 Research and development 8 6 6 General and administration 16 11 17 Restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net 1 2 Amortization of other intangibles assets 8 6 7 Acquired in process research and development 1 1 Total costs and expenses 94 87 93 Operating income from continuing operations 6 13 7 Minority interest Other income, net 3 3 7 Total other income, net 3 3 7 Income from continuing operation before income taxes 9 16 14 Income tax (benefit) expense (15 ) 6 2 Net income from continuing operations 24 10 12 Discontinued operations Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax 1 2 Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax 16 Net income from discontinued operations 17 2 Net income 24 % 27 % 14 % (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenues In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we had two reportable segments: the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. A comparison of revenues from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: December 31, 2006 % Change December 31, 2005 % Change December 31, 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) (Dollars in thousands) Internet Services Group $ 758,763 20 % $ 633,784 23 % $ 515,999 Communications Services Group 816,486 (17 )% 978,790 62 % 604,596 Total revenues $ 1,575,249 (2 )% $ 1,612,574 44 % $ 1,120,595 (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 77 Table of Contents Internet Services Group (ISG) 2006 compared to 2005: Revenues from our ISG increased by approximately $125.0 million. Our Information Services Group revenue increased $83.7 million due to a 30% increase in the number of active domain names ending in .com and .net under management. Our Security Services Group revenue increased $41.2 million primarily due to a $26.0 million increase in Website digital certificate revenue that was the result of a 65% increase in the installed base of digital certificates, a $17.7 million increase in our managed security services and security consulting revenues partially offset by a $3.7 million decrease in enterprise security services revenue. The 65% increase in the install base of Website digital certificates was primarily due to the 259,000 additional certificates acquired as a result of the acquisition of GeoTrust in September of 2006. 2005 compared to 2004: Revenues from our ISG increased by approximately by $117.8 million. Our Information Services revenue increased $62.3 million due a 30% increase in active domains ending in .com and .net under management. Our Security Services group increased $55.7 million, primarily due to a $29.2 million increase in Website digital certificate revenues, and a $32.8 million increase in managed security services and security consulting revenue, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease in enterprise security services. The following table compares active domain names ending in .com and .net managed by our Information Services business and the approximate installed base of Website digital certificates in our commerce site services business as of the end of each year presented: December 31, 2006 % Change December 31, 2005 % Change December 31, 2004 Active domain names ending in .com and .net 65.0 million 30 % 50.0 million 30 % 38.4 million Installed base of Web site digital certificates 807,000 65 % 489,000 7 % 455,000 Excluding the GeoTrust transaction, the installed base of digital certificates would have increased 12% year over year. Communications Services Group (CSG) 2006 compared to 2005: Revenues from our CSG decreased approximately $162.3 million, partially offset by a $57.8 million increase in revenue as a result of new acquisitions in 2006. Our Content Services revenue, which includes our digital content, messaging and mobile delivery services, decreased $159.4 million primarily due to a $231.7 million decrease from Jamba, partially offset by $26.0 million increase in messaging services and $46.2 million of revenue as a result of 2006 acquisitions. The decline in our content services business was primarily attributable to increased pricing pressure and a decline in the number of subscribers. Our Communication and Commerce Services revenue, which includes network connectivity services, intelligent databases and directory services, billing and payment services and clearing and settlement services decreased by $7.8 million compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $13.4 million decrease in clearing and settlement services and a $6.7 million decrease in connectivity and database services. These declines were primarily due to industry consolidation and pricing pressures. These declines were partially offset by $6.4 million increase in billing and payment services, which was primarily due to the result of an increase in the number of subscribers. 2005 compared to 2004: Revenues from our CSG increased approximately $374.2 million primarily due to a $373.3 million increase in content services revenues during the year. This increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of Jamba revenue in 2005 as compared to seven months of revenue in 2004 coupled with significant growth in our content services business during 2005. The content services business grew in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004; however, revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 due to increased pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers. Network services and connectivity revenues increased approximately $7.0 million and clearing, roaming, settlement and intelligent network services revenues also increased by approximately 78 Table of Contents $10.9 million primarily due an increase in the number of records and transactions cleared. These increases were offset by a decline in billing and payment services of approximately $24.7 million primarily due to a decline in the subscriber base and pricing reductions for these services during the year. Intelligent database services revenues were unchanged from 2004 as increases in queries were off set by price declines in our calling name (CNAM) service. The following table compares the approximate number of annual database queries as of the end of each year presented: December 31, 2006 % Change December 31, 2005 % Change December 31, 2004 Annual database queries 64.4 billion 12 % 57.6 billion 21 % 47.8 billion Revenues from the Jamba business unit generated approximately $299 million in CSG revenue in 2006. We will record Jamba revenues through January 2007, and starting in February 2007, we will account for Jamba as an investment accounted for under the equity method. We will record 49% of the Jamba joint venture net income as other income in the statement of income. Revenues by Geographic Region Our revenues are broken out into three geographic regions consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC. The following table shows a comparison of our continuing revenues by geographic region for each year presented: 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) (In thousands) Americas: United States $ 1,104,594 $ 1,012,448 $ 796,124 Other (2) 40,119 25,214 19,734 Total Americas 1,144,713 1,037,662 815,858 EMEA (3) 312,886 476,305 239,598 APAC (4) 117,650 98,607 65,139 Total revenues $ 1,575,249 $ 1,612,574 $ 1,120,595 (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues in our EMEA region decreased approximately $163.4 million primarily due to a decrease in revenue from Jamba business unit in the region. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $19.0 million was attributed to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security services revenue in Japan. 2005 compared to 2004: Revenues increased approximately $221.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the increase in domain names ending in .com and .net under management coupled with an increase in the installed base of website digital certificates. Revenues in our EMEA region increased approximately $236.7 million primarily due to recognizing a full year of revenue from our Jamba business unit in 79 Table of Contents the region coupled with strong growth in Jamba in the first half of 2005. The increase in APAC revenues of approximately $33.5 million was attributed to increased enterprise security revenues in both Japan and Australia and increased managed security services revenue in Japan. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists primarily of content licensing costs, carrier costs for our SS7 and IP based networks, costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services, billing services, operational costs for the domain name registration business, customer support and training, consulting and development services, operational costs related to the management and monitoring of our clients network security infrastructures, and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities.

Contract and professional services increased approximately $13.9 million in 2006, primarily due to increased third party customer care services and an increase in the use of contractors to support new product initiatives and as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2006. 2005 compared to 2004: Cost of revenues increased approximately $74.7 million primarily due to the business acquisitions completed in 2005 and an increase in costs in our content services business that was primarily due to the Jamba acquisition in 2004. Salary and employee benefit costs increased approximately $33.8 million primarily due to a 24% increase in headcount, primarily due to completed business acquisitions in 2005 and increases in commissions and bonuses. Expenses related to contract and professional services increased approximately $18.0 million in 2005, primarily due to increased costs for third party customer care services, consulting for billing services and service development costs for prepaid services. Retailer commissions related to content services increased approximately $7.4 million over 2004. Other increases in cost of revenues were related to cost of maintenance of equipment and software. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in stock compensation expense that resulted from variable plan accounting for certain stock option grants. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales, marketing, and policy activities. These expenses include salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing programs, such as Internet, television, radio, print, and direct mail advertising costs. 80 Table of Contents A comparison of sales and marketing expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 377,550 (21 )% $ 479,599 94 % $ 246,659 Percentage of revenues 24 % 30 % 22 % Employee headcount 989 30 % 763 16 % 656 (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 compared to 2005: Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $102.0 million primarily due to a decrease of approximately $144.9 million in advertising and marketing expense. The reason for the decline in advertising and marketing was primarily due to the result of significant marketing cutbacks for our content services business.

Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment and support services used in service and technology development. We believe that rapid development of new and enhanced services and technologies are necessary to maintain our leadership position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development. A comparison of research and development expenses and employee headcount for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 129,343 35 % $ 95,594 50 % $ 63,689 Percentage of revenues 8 % 6 % 6 % Employee headcount 1,022 28 % 801 96 % 408 (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 81 Table of Contents 2006 compared to 2005: Research and development expenses increased approximately $33.7 million primarily due to additional expenses associated with the business acquisitions completed during 2006 and a full year of expenses for the completed business acquisitions in fiscal 2005.

The changes in restructuring, impairment and other charges (reversals), net are primarily due to the timing of our restructuring initiatives. 2002 and 2003 Restructuring Plan. In 2006, we recorded net reversal of restructuring charges of approximately $6.4 million primarily due to a $7.5 million reversal from an early termination of a lease for a facility we had previously estimated would remain vacant for the remainder of the lease term. During 2005, we recorded a net reversal of restructuring charges of $2.9 million to our excess facilities primarily in connection with a decision to utilize and build a facility that we had treated as abandoned under its 2003 restructuring plan and for which we had previously recorded a restructuring charge. As part of the restatement, we recorded a $2.3 million reversal to correct a charge that was incorrectly expensed in 2005 and should have been expensed in 2003. In 2004, we recorded $3.3 million of restructuring charges primarily related to non cancelable leases, workforce reduction charges and exit costs. Impairment and other charges. In 2006, we recorded an impairment of approximately $2.0 million of other intangible assets specifically related to abandoned technology acquired for a specific customer. During 2005, we abandoned the development efforts related to an internally developed software project and recorded an impairment of approximately $21.6 million. During 2004, we recorded approximately $20.1 million primarily relating to an impairment of obsolete telecommunications computer software and other equipment. See Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Reversals), net in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Below is a comparison of our amortization of other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Amortization of other intangible assets $ 122,767 $ 101,638 $ 79,440 2006 compared to 2005: Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $21.1 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in 2005 and new intangible assets acquired in 2006. Other intangible amortization expense as a result of business acquired in 2006 was approximately $29.1 million. 83 Table of Contents 2005 compared to 2004: Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $22.2 million primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of Jamba in June of 2004 and amortization expense related to our acquisition of LightSurf Technologies in April of 2005. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from Jamba accounted for approximately $10.2 million of the increase. Amortization of intangible assets acquired from LightSurf accounted for approximately $8.8 million of the increase. Our anticipated 2007 amortization expense is expected to be approximately $124.3 million, including approximately $8.0 million related to Jamba. This amount may increase if we acquire any additional companies with intangible assets, or decrease if we dispose of any current companies with net intangible assets. See Note 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Acquired In process Research and Development During 2006, we wrote off approximately $16.7 million of in process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in the CallVision, Kontiki, m Qube and GeoTrust transactions. During 2005, we wrote off $7.7 million of IPR&D acquired in the purchase of LightSurf Technologies, iDefense, Moreover and Retail Solutions International. At the date of each acquisition, the projects associated with the IPR&D efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies. Minority interest Minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries. A comparison of minority interest for the years ended December 31 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below: 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Minority interest $ 2,875 $ 4,702 $ 2,618 2006 compared to 2005: Minority interest decreased primarily from decreased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary primarily due to a decrease in the install base of website security certificates and a decrease in demand for managed security services in Japan. 2005 compared to 2004: Minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our VeriSign Japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the install base of website security certificates and increased demand for managed security services in Japan. Other Income (Expense), net Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments, gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments, and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses. 84 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of other income, net for years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 As Restated (1) As Restated (1) (Dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 27,537 $ 30,041 $ 18,325 Interest expense (7,838 ) Net gain (loss) on sale of investments, net of impairments 21,258 11,252 (10,131 ) Gain on sale of VeriSign Japan stock 74,925 Other, net 2,783 9,918 401 Total other income, net $ 43,740 $ 51,211 $ 83,520 (1) See Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2006 compared to 2005: Other income decreased approximately $7.5 million primarily due to $7.8 million in interest expense related to our outstanding balance from our credit facility in 2006. We recorded a $21.7 million gain on sale of our remaining equity stake in Network Solutions. Interest income decreased $2.5 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in our short term investment balances. 2005 compared to 2004: Other income decreased approximately $32.3 million primarily due to a gain on sale of VeriSign Japan stock of approximately $74.9 million in 2004. In 2005, we realized gains on investments, net of losses and impairments, of approximately $11.3 million. Interest income increased $11.7 million, primarily as a result of higher cash balances and slightly higher interest rates during 2005. In 2005 we recorded a gain of approximately $6.0 million related to the resolution of a dispute with a telecommunications carrier customer. As part of the restatement, we reduced our 2004 other income by $1.9 million for a gain on investment that should have been recorded in 2003. Income Tax Expense In the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded income tax benefit from continuing operations of $241.3 million, or 176.5% of pretax income, income tax expense of $101.0 million, or 38.4% of pretax income, and income tax expense of $21.2 million, or 13.5% of pretax income, respectively. In previous fiscal years, we provided a tax valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets based on our evaluation that realizability of such assets was not more likely than not. We continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Such deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, temporary differences on tax deductible goodwill and intangibles, and temporary differences on deferred revenue. In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, based on additional evidence regarding our past earnings, scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities, we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized. Accordingly, we released our valuation allowance of $236.4 million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a credit to statement of income. We continue to assess the future realization of net deferred tax assets and believe that it is more likely than not that forecasted income, tax effects of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income from operating activities will be sufficient to support future realization of net deferred tax assets. However, we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets which we do not believe are more likely than not that they would be realized. We continue to apply a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to capital loss carryforwards and to book write downs of investments, due to the limited 85 Table of Contents carryforward period and character of such tax attributes. The amount of this deferred tax asset which continues to be subject to a valuation allowance was $44.5 million as of June 30, 2006, the date on which we released the valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets, and $51.9 million as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $433.2 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $473.6 million, including federal and state net operating losses related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards of $460.5 million and $265.3 million respectively, when recognized, will result in a benefit to additional paid in capital of $172.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32.3 million. If we are not able to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards, they will expire in 2011 through 2026 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2007 through 2024. Most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire, but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary. As of December 31, 2006, we had federal research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately $30.4 million, state research and experimentation tax credits available for future years of approximately $12.6 million. Included in these amounts are $7.9 million of federal, and $4.5 million of state research credit carryforwards generated from stock option exercises prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). The future utilization of these attributes will result in recognition of the asset and a benefit to additional paid in capital. The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2011 through 2026. State research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporations ownership change, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than 50 percent in 2003 and 2002. These changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $232.9 million and $116.5 million, respectively. Losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward, but are subject to the expiration dates described in the paragraph above. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The amount of such earnings included in consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 2006 was $121.7 million. These earnings have been permanently reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings. In the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we were granted relief from the IRS for an uncertainty regarding a tax benefit resulting from a prior divestiture. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit $113.4 million, increased our deferred tax asset for net operating losses from continuing operations $51.8 million, and reduced income taxes payable $61.6 million. Our effective rate in 2006 differs from 2005 primarily because of the reduction in our valuation allowance, the aforementioned reversal of a tax uncertainty and the implementation of a new global business structure. Our new international business structure is being implemented to align our asset ownership and business operations with our newly announced functional business structure and the business needs of the our global customers. In future years, we expect to achieve a lower effective tax rate, as well as business efficiencies, as a result of this new international business structure. On March 19, 2007, the IRS commenced an examination our federal tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2004. We currently believe this examination will not have a material impact on our financial statements; however the examination is still in progress. 86 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 501,184 $ 476,826 $ 328,842 Short term investments 198,656 378,006 406,784 Subtotal 699,840 $ 854,832 $ 735,626 Restricted cash and investments 49,437 50,972 51,518 Total $ 749,277 $ 905,804 $ 787,144 Working capital from continuing operations $ (19,901 ) $ 281,659 $ 307,526 At December 31, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was $699.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, consisting principally of commercial paper, medium term investment grade corporate notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds.

In 2006 and 2005, we did not receive or use any cash related to investing activities from discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was approximately $1.5 million for 2004, primarily for purchases of property and equipment. Property and Equipment Expenditures The following table shows our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2007 and our actual expenditures in 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): 2007 Planned 2006 Actual 2005 Actual 2004 Actual Property and equipment expenditures $ 200,000 $ 141,700 $ 140,499 $ 91,002 Our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2007 will primarily be focused on productivity, cost improvement and market development initiatives for the Internet Services Group and the Communications Services Group. Included in our planned expenditures for 2007, is approximately $50.0 million for the construction of a new data facility in New Castle, Delaware. 88 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant non cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2007 20082009 20102011 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income $ 107,408 $ 30,413 $ 44,475 $ 27,057 $ 5,463 Purchase obligations 99,908 73,611 25,030 1,017 250 ICANN agreement 64,000 7,000 22,000 24,000 11,000 Long term royalty payments 4,000 2,000 2,000 Total $ 275,316 $ 113,024 $ 93,505 $ 52,074 $ 16,713 As of December 31, 2006, we had commitments under non cancelable operating leases for our facilities for various terms through 2014. See Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Future operating lease payments include payments related to leases on excess facilities included in our restructuring plans. The restructuring liability is included on the balance sheet as accrued restructuring costs. Amounts related to the lease terminations due to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through 2008. Cash payments totaling approximately $4.7 million related to the abandonment of excess facilities will be paid over the next two years. We enter into certain purchase obligations with various vendors. In 2006, we entered into a $38.6 million construction contract to build our new data facility in Delaware. Our remaining commitments for the facility are $33.0 million, which is expected to be completed in 2007. We also have commitments of approximately $25.5 million in 2007 with various telecommunication providers and approximately $15.1 million in 2007 with various suppliers for software and maintenance contracts. In 2006, we entered into a contractual agreement with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to be the sole registry operator for domain names in the .com top level domain through November 30, 2012. The new agreement introduced a fixed, registry level fee that we will have to pay to ICANN beginning in 2007. Beginning in 2009, the agreement provides for contingent payments upon meeting certain performance criteria that could amount to an additional $20.5 million through the end of the contract. In November 1999, we entered into an agreement for the management and administration of the Tuvalu country code top level domain, .tv with the Government of Tuvalu for payments of future royalties which will amount to $4.0 million through 2008. We have pledged a portion of our short term investments as collateral for standby letters of credit that guarantee certain of our contractual obligations, primarily relating to our real estate lease agreements. We have pledged approximately $4.4 million pursuant to such agreements classified as restricted cash and investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we established a trust during the first quarter of 2004 in the amount of $45.0 million classified as restricted cash and investments on our balance sheet for our director and officer liability self insurance coverage. Short term Loan On June 7, 2006, we entered into a $500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Facility), under which we, or certain designated subsidiaries may be borrowers. As of December 31, 2006, $199.0 million was borrowed from the Facility, of which $74.0 million was used to refinance our borrowings under a credit 89 Table of Contents agreement that expired on July 10, 2006. In addition, on August 31, 2006, VeriSign drew down $125 million on the Facility, which was used for the purchase of GeoTrust on September 1, 2006. Any other borrowings under the Facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock and other lawful corporate purposes. On February 28, 2007 we repaid the outstanding balance of $199.0 million on the Facility. See Note 10 Credit Facility of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Facility. Stock Repurchase Program We repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase program was completed in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $500 million of our common stock in open market, negotiated or block transactions. This stock repurchase was completed in the second quarter of 2006. On May 16, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market, or in negotiated or block trades. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately $984.6 million available under the 2006 stock repurchase program. The table sets forth the total amount of shares repurchased and net purchase price for the years presented: December 31,2006 December 31,2005 December 31,2004 (In thousands) Shares repurchased 6,490 22,817 4,474 Aggregate purchase price $ 135,000 $ 548,630 $ 113,257 From the inception of the stock purchase program in 2001 to December 31, 2006, a total of 35.3 million shares have been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $865.3 million. In October 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer an indeterminate number of shares of common stock that may be issued at various times and at indeterminate prices, with a total public offering price not to exceed $750 million. To date, no shares have been issued under this registration statement. If we liquidated certain available for sale investments as of December 31, 2006, we would have recognized losses of approximately $2.0 million in our consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized losses, partially offset by unrecognized gains, are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe existing cash and short term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to expansion of our businesses, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 (SFAS 159), The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets or Financial Liabilities which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and 90 Table of Contents liabilities at fair value. The objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 159 and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided we have not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 157 and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 provides transition guidance for correcting errors and requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative factors. In the year of adoption only, if the effect of prior periods uncorrected misstatement is determined to be material, under SAB 108 a registrant is allowed to record the effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings. SAB 108 does not change the requirements within SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections for the correction of an error on financial statements. Further, SAB 108 does not change the Staffs previous guidance in SAB No. 99, Materiality, on evaluating the qualitative materiality of misstatements. We were required to adopt SAB 108 in our current fiscal year. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. We are required to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit. We have evaluated the effect of FIN 48, and we believe that adoption of this accounting principle will result in a decrease to our accumulated deficit in the first quarter of 2007 of $38.6 million, an increase to non current deferred tax assets of $28.7 million, and a decrease to income taxes payable of $9.9 million. In June 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06 3 (EITF 06 3), How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement. EITF 06 3 provides guidance on an entitys disclosure of its accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of certain taxes and provides that if taxes included in gross revenues are significant, a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented (i.e., both interim and annual periods). Taxes within the scope of EITF 06 3 are those that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning 91 Table of Contents after December 15, 2006. We have evaluated the effect of EITF 06 3, and we believe the impact will be immaterial on our financial position and results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Equity investments We invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes. In most instances, we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market, and therefore, carry a high level of risk. These companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term. Therefore, these companies may never become publicly traded. Even if they do, an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized impairments totaling $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $12.6 million, respectively. Due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments, we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments. Interest rate sensitivity The primary objective of our short term investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities. We invest in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, medium term notes, corporate bonds and notes, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In general, money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. As of December 31, 2006, 68% of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our fixed income securities in our short term investment portfolio as of December 31, 2006, arising from potential changes in interest rates. The modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 25 basis points (BPS), 50 BPS, 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

As we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than 12 months. At December 31, 2006, we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately $182.4 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. All forward contracts are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions. 93 Table of Contents
