We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document. Overview We are a provider of Internet infrastructure services. By leveraging our global infrastructure, we provide network confidence and availability for mission critical Internet services, such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services. Our service capabilities enable domain name registration through registrars and provide network availability for registrars and Internet users alike. Our business consists of one reportable segment, Naming Services, which consists of Registry Services and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services. Registry Services operates the authoritative directory of all .com, .net, .cc, .tv, and .name domain names and the back end systems for all .gov, .jobs and .edu domain names. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 113.8 million domain names registered under the .com and .net registries, our principal registries. The number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e commerce, and the number of Internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband, as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third party registrars. Although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in the U.S., growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the U.S. over the long term. NIA Services provides infrastructure assurance services to organizations and is comprised of Verisign iDefense Security Intelligence Services, Managed Domain Name System Services, and Distributed Denial of Service Protection Services. Revenues from NIA Services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenue. 2011 Business Highlights and Trends We recorded revenues of $772.0 million, an increase of 13% as compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an 8% year over year increase in active domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in our .com and .net registry fees in July 2010. We recorded operating income of $329.4 million, an increase of 42% as compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in revenues and as well as a reduction in general and administrative expenses as we completed the 2010 Restructuring Plan. In April 2011, we declared and in May 2011 paid a special dividend of $2.75 per share of our common stock totaling $463.5 million. As a result of the dividend, we also paid $100.0 million in contingent interest to holders of our Convertible Debentures. We repurchased 16.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $534.6 million in 2011 under the 2010 Share Buyback Program. In 2011, we sold $546.0 million of marketable securities, primarily to fund the May 2011 special dividend. 35 Table of Contents We generated cash flows from operating activities of $335.9 million, an increase of 56% as compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees as well as greater income taxes payable in 2010 as a result of the gain resulting from the sale of the Authentication Services business, before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs). The increase was partially offset by the elimination of cash flows from the divested Authentication Services business. We renewed our agreement with ICANN to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .net registry for another six years, effective July 1, 2011. In November 2011, we purchased our new corporate headquarters building in Reston, Virginia for $118.5 million. In November 2011, we entered into a new $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility and borrowed $100.0 million under this facility in part to finance the purchase of the Reston building. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition We generate revenues by providing services over a period of time. Fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs. The majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions. However, at times, we enter into non standard arrangements including multiple element arrangements. As a result, we must evaluate (1) whether an arrangement exists, (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. Our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. Fair value of financial instruments Our Convertible Debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative. The embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value, and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period. We utilize a valuation model based on stock price, bond price, risk adjusted interest rates, volatility, and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative. Several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment. Litigation and contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies are based on managements judgment as to the potential amount of loss incurred. A liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 36 Table of Contents These liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment. If actual results differ from these estimates, our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved. Income taxes Accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards, domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards, the adequacy of valuation allowances, and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from U.S. federal, state, and international tax audits. We only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. We adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon. We consider the following matters, among others, in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment: the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term; the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest; and any U.S. and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances. If factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings, the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Earnings per Share We use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share. Under this method, only a positive conversion spread related to the convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. This is based on managements intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the debt in cash. A change in managements intent and ability would require us to use the if converted method, which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information regarding our results of operations as a percentage of revenues: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % Costs and expenses Cost of revenues 21 23 27 Sales and marketing 13 12 12 Research and development 7 8 9 General and administrative 14 20 24 Restructuring and impairment charges 2 3 2 Total costs and expenses 57 66 74 Operating income 43 34 26 Interest expense (19 ) (23 ) (8 ) Non operating income, net 1 3 2 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 25 14 20 Income tax expense (7 ) (4 ) (5 ) Income from continuing operations, net of tax 18 10 15 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 1 112 26 Net income 19 122 41 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary (1 ) Net income attributable to Verisign stockholders 19 % 122 % 40 % Revenues Revenues related to our Registry Services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the .com, .net, .cc, .tv, .name, .gov and .jobs domain name registries. Revenues from .cc, .tv, .name, .gov and .jobs are not significant. For domain names registered with the .com and .net registries, we receive a fee from third party registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with ICANN. Individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with third party registrars or their resellers, and the third party registrars in turn register the .com, .net, .cc, .tv, .name, .gov and .jobs domain names with Verisign. Changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations, in each case as impacted by continued Internet growth, promotional marketing programs, marketing expenditure by third party registrars, as well as fee increases as permitted under our agreements with ICANN. On July 1, 2010, we increased our .com domain name registration fees by 7% from $6.86 to $7.34 and our .net domain name registration fees by 10% from $4.23 to $4.65. In July 2011, we announced another fee increase for .com domain name registrations of 7% from $7.34 to $7.85 and for .net domain name registrations of 10% from $4.65 to $5.11. The fee increases announced in July 2011 became effective January 15, 2012. We have the contractual right to increase the fees for .net domain name registrations by up to 10% each year during the term of our renewed agreement with ICANN through June 30, 2017. We offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate. We are largely insulated from the risk posed by fluctuations in exchange rates due to the fact that all revenues paid to us for .com and .net registrations are in U.S. dollars. Revenues from NIA Services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenue. 38 Table of Contents A comparison of revenues is presented below: 2011 %Change 2010 %Change 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 771,978 13 % $ 680,578 10 % $ 615,947 The following table compares domain names ending in .com and .net managed by our Registry Services business: December 31,2011 %Change December 31,2010 %Change December 31,2009 Active domain names ending in .com and .net 113.8 million 8 % 105.2 million 9 % 96.7 million Our revenues increased by $91.4 million in 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily due to an 8% year over year increase in the number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in our .com and .net registry fees in July 2010 as per our agreements with ICANN. Our revenues increased by $64.6 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily due to a 9% year over year increase in the number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in our .com and .net registry fees in October 2008 and July 2010 as per our agreements with ICANN, partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in revenues because of a one time project in the U.S. that was completed in 2009. The growth in the number of active domain names was primarily driven by continued Internet growth and new domain name promotional programs. We expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in 2012 as a result of further Internet growth. In addition, we expect to see continued growth internationally in both .com and .net domain name bases, especially in markets that we have targeted through our marketing programs. We expect revenues to increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in .com and .net and implementation of the price increase which became effective in January 2012 as domain names are renewed at the increased price. Mature markets such as the U.S., where broadband and e commerce have seen strong market penetration, are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets. We expect to see larger increases in certain international regions, resulting from greater broadband and Internet penetration and expanding e commerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted. Presentation of geographic revenues is included in Note 10, Geographic and Customer Information, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. New TLDs, including new IDN TLDs, ccTLDs and gTLDs, may be introduced by ICANN in 2012. We cannot assess the impact, if any, the introduction of these new TLDs will have on our revenues and results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The business environment is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, we may suffer price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, of this Form 10 K. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel that manage the operational systems, depreciation expenses, operational costs associated with the delivery of our services, fees paid to ICANN, customer support and training, consulting and development services, costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities, telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead. All allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations. 39 Table of Contents A comparison of cost of revenues is presented below: 2011 %Change 2010 %Change 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues $ 165,246 5 % $ 156,676 (6 %) $ 166,705 2011 compared to 2010: Cost of revenues increased primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses, depreciation expenses, telecommunication expenses, contract and professional services expenses, and direct cost of revenues, partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $7.4 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support Registry Services, and an increase in stock based compensation expenses due to additional vested RSUs granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the December 2010 and May 2011 special cash dividends. Depreciation expenses increased by $3.0 million, primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software purchased to support investments in infrastructure projects. Telecommunication expenses increased by $2.8 million, primarily due to additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure. Contract and professional services expenses increased by $1.2 million, primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff. Direct cost of revenues increased by $1.1 million, primarily due to costs for a new data hosting service. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $5.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs. 2010 compared to 2009: Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in allocated overhead expenses, expenses related to a one time revenue project, occupancy expenses, contract and professional services expenses, and equipment and software expenses, partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses, depreciation expenses, telecommunication expenses and fees paid to ICANN. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $14.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the cost of revenues function as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009. Expenses related to a one time revenue project that was completed in 2009 decreased by $4.5 million. Occupancy expenses decreased by $2.4 million, primarily due to the purchase in December 2009 of a previously leased facility, management cost saving initiatives to reduce overall utility expenses, and the elimination of certain shared services utility expenses as a result of the sale of the Authentication Services business. Contract and professional services expenses decreased by $1.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources. Equipment and software expenses decreased by $1.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in equipment and software maintenance contracts required to support the business as a result of the sale of the Authentication Services business and the purchase in 2010 of certain equipment that had been previously leased. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $4.2 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount. Depreciation expenses increased by $3.7 million, primarily due to an increase in capitalized hardware and software to support investments in our infrastructure and the purchase in 2009 of a previously leased facility. Telecommunication expenses increased by $3.3 million, primarily due to an increase in colocation expenses and additional circuits required to support the increase in our network infrastructure. Fees paid to ICANN increased by $3.0 million resulting from a fee increase in July 2009. We expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decrease slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011, as our revenue grows faster than the related costs. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees, costs of marketing programs, such as online, television, radio, print and direct mail advertising costs, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead. All allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations. 40 Table of Contents A comparison of sales and marketing expenses is presented below: 2011 %Change 2010 %Change 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 97,432 17 % $ 83,390 11 % $ 75,348 2011 compared to 2010: Sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses. Advertising and consulting expenses increased by $8.1 million, primarily due to increases in product marketing initiatives promoting Registry Services. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $7.8 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount of our sales force and an increase in stock based compensation expenses due to additional vested RSUs granted during 2011 to option holders as they did not participate in the December 2010 and May 2011 special cash dividends. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $3.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. 2010 compared to 2009: Sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and consulting expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses. Advertising and consulting expenses increased by $6.4 million, primarily due to certain corporate and Registry Services related advertising and marketing campaigns in 2010. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased $6.3 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount of our sales force and other new products and services. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $5.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and a decrease in proportional headcount within the sales and marketing function as a result of divestitures in 2010 and 2009. We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase slightly in 2012 as compared to 2011, as we realize a full year effect of increased headcount in our sales force and continued investments in certain marketing initiatives. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel related expenses, consulting fees, facilities costs, computer and communications equipment, support services used in our service and technology development, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead. All allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations. A comparison of research and development expenses is presented below: 2011 %Change 2010 %Change 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Research and development $ 53,277 (1 %) $ 53,664 2 % $ 52,364 2011 compared to 2010: Research and development expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in allocated overhead expenses and an increase in capitalized labor, partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses and contract and professional services expenses. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $3.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs. Capitalized labor increased by $1.3 million, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $2.5 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount to support the development of our DNS infrastructure and new services. Contract and professional services expenses increased by $1.1 million in 2011, primarily due to an increased need for temporary staff. 41 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009: Research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in allocated overhead expenses, an increase in capitalized labor, and a decrease in contract and professional services expenses. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $9.5 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount primarily used to support the development of the DNS infrastructure and the NIA Services business. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $3.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs as a result of the divestitures in 2010 and 2009. Capitalized labor increased by $2.4 million, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work performed on internally developed software projects. Contract and professional services expenses decreased by $1.6 million, primarily due to a decrease in the need for such external services and the increase in internal resources. We expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2012 as compared to 2011. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees, and bad debt expense, offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types. All allocations of indirect costs are included in continuing operations. A comparison of general and administrative expenses is presented below: 2011 %Change 2010 %Change 2009 (Dollars in thousands) General and administrative $ 111,122 (19 %) $ 137,704 (6 %) $ 146,531 2011 compared to 2010: General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, miscellaneous general and administrative expenses, depreciation expenses, contract and professional services expenses, telecommunication expenses, and equipment and software expenses, partially offset by a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types. Salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by $18.2 million, primarily as a result of reduced corporate support functions needed subsequent to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. Occupancy expenses decreased by $7.3 million, primarily due to lower rent expenses as the lease for certain office buildings expired in 2010. Miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.5 million, primarily due to the release of $5.9 million of liabilities in 2011 related to non income tax expenses as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations, partially offset by certain adjustments in 2010 for a release of an accrual for certain non income tax contingencies when the statute of limitations expired. Depreciation expenses decreased by $3.1 million, primarily due to ceasing further depreciation on corporate assets held for sale in May 2010, the expenses of which were classified in continuing operations until the third quarter of 2010. Contract and professional services expenses decreased by $3.0 million, primarily due to costs in 2010 to support the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. Telecommunication expenses decreased by $1.6 million, primarily due to lower shared costs included in continuing operations as a result of divestitures. Equipment and software expenses decreased by $1.6 million, primarily due to lower shared software costs subsequent to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. Overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by $12.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs. 2010 compared to 2009: General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in contract and professional services expenses, telecommunication expenses, depreciation expenses, miscellaneous general and administrative expenses, and salary and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in 42 Table of Contents corporate overhead expenses allocated to other cost types. Contract and professional services expenses decreased by $9.7 million, primarily due to professional services costs incurred in 2009 for accounting and auditing services related to our divestiture strategy, as well as a reduction in our need for such outside professional services. Telecommunication expenses decreased by $6.2 million, primarily due to a reduction in circuits to support the business as a result of the divestitures and a one time minimum commitment short fall expense recorded in 2009. Depreciation expenses decreased by $4.9 million, primarily due to certain capital software projects becoming fully depreciated prior to 2010 and ceasing further depreciation on corporate assets held for sale in May 2010, the expenses of which were classified as continuing operations until the third quarter of 2010. Miscellaneous general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.1 million, primarily due to certain adjustments in 2010 for a release of an accrual for certain non income tax contingencies when the statute of limitations expired, a refund of a previously expensed non income tax payment, and an adjustment of certain expense accruals, coupled with certain asset write offs during 2009. Salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by $4.0 million primarily due to a decrease in average headcount primarily due to the divestitures in 2010 and 2009 and a reduction in the amount of overhead to support the business. Overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by $21.4 million primarily due to a decrease in allocable indirect costs and proportionately higher headcount in the general and administrative function as a result of the divestures in 2010 and 2009. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease in 2012 as compared to 2011, as we realize a full year of post divestiture cost reductions in our general and administrative function. Restructuring and Impairment Charges See Note 6, Restructuring Charges, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Additionally, in 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.7 million related to our .name gTLD intangible asset. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of contractual interest payments on Convertible Debentures, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on the liability component of our Convertible Debentures, contingent interest payments to holders of our Convertible Debentures, interest expenses related to our current $200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and our previous $500.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2006 Facility), offset by capitalized interest. We terminated the 2006 Facility in November 2010. A comparison of interest expense is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Contractual interest on Convertible Debentures $ 40,625 $ 40,625 $ 40,625 Amortization of debt discount on the Convertible Debentures 7,355 6,775 6,241 Contingent interest to holders of the Convertible Debentures 100,020 109,113 Interest capitalized to property and equipment, net (980 ) (676 ) (1,090 ) Other interest expense 312 1,830 1,575 Total interest expense $ 147,332 $ 157,667 $ 47,351 The Indenture governing the Convertible Debentures requires the payment of contingent interest to the holders of the Convertible Debentures if the Board declares a dividend to our stockholders that is designated by the Board as an extraordinary dividend. The contingent interest is calculated as the amount derived by multiplying the per share declared dividend with the if converted number of shares applicable to the Convertible 43 Table of Contents Debentures. The Board declared extraordinary dividends in April 2011 and December 2010, and consequently, we paid $100.0 million and $109.1 million contingent interest, respectively, to holders of the Convertible Debentures. The lower contingent interest payment in 2011 was the primary driver of the decrease in total interest expense from 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the contingent interest payment. Non operating Income, Net Non operating income, net, consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, net gains or losses on the sale and impairment of investments, net gains or losses on the divestiture of certain businesses, unrealized gains and losses on the contingent interest derivative on the Convertible Debentures, income from transition services agreements, and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses. A comparison of non operating income, net, is presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 5,017 $ 7,652 $ 2,638 Net gain on divestiture of businesses and joint ventures 908 Unrealized (loss) gain on contingent interest derivative on Convertible Debentures (1,125 ) (500 ) 549 Income from transition services agreements 8,083 10,631 4,944 Realized net gain on investments 4,246 3,978 145 Other, net (4,691 ) (1,023 ) 2,761 Total non operating income, net $ 11,530 $ 20,738 $ 11,945 2011 compared to 2010: Non operating income, net, decreased by $9.2 million in 2011. Interest and dividend income decreased primarily as a result of lower cash balances and investments in marketable securities in 2011. Income from transition services agreements decreased primarily due to a decrease in transition services provided to support the sale of the Authentication Services business. Other, net decreased primarily due to a $3.9 million out of period adjustment recorded in 2011 for certain non income taxes related to investments. 2010 compared to 2009: Non operating income, net, increased in 2010. Interest and dividend income increased primarily as a result of investing in 2010 in marketable securities which have higher interest rates as compared to money market funds, and higher average cash balances as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the Authentication Services business. Income from transition services agreements increased, primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009. Realized net gain on investments increased, primarily due to a $4.3 million realized gain in 2010 due to distributions received from certain investment funds that exceed their book value. Other, net, in 2010, includes $1.9 million in miscellaneous income, partially offset by $2.9 million in foreign currency losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011 2010 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,313,349 $ 1,559,628 Marketable securities 32,860 501,238 Total $ 1,346,209 $ 2,060,866 As of December 31, 2011, our principal source of liquidity was $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $32.9 million of marketable securities. The marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. The cash equivalents consist mainly of time deposits and amounts deposited in money market funds. As of December 31, 2011, all marketable securities were invested in fixed income securities with maturities between one and three years. Our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. For additional information on our investment portfolio, see Note 2, Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.1 billion. Our intent is to permanently reinvest outside of the U.S. those funds held by foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the U.S. Currently, we do not anticipate that we will need funds that were generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the U.S. and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. During 2011, we repatriated $86.4 million of funds that had been previously taxed in the U.S. from our foreign subsidiaries. In April 2011, we declared and in May 2011 paid a special cash dividend of $2.75 per share of our common stock totaling $463.5 million. As a result of the dividend, we also paid $100.0 million in contingent interest to holders of our Convertible Debentures. In December 2010, we declared and paid a special dividend of $3.00 per share of our common stock totaling $518.2 million. As a result of the dividend, we also paid $109.1 million in contingent interest to holders of our Convertible Debentures. In 2011, we repurchased approximately 16.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $32.76 for an aggregate cost of $534.6 million. In 2010, we repurchased approximately 15.7 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $27.93 for an aggregate cost of $437.7 million. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $22.31 for an aggregate cost of $252.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, $831.3 million remained available for further repurchases under the 2010 Share Buyback Program. In November 2011, we entered into a $200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We borrowed $100.0 million from this facility during 2011 in connection with the purchase of our new corporate headquarters building in Reston, Virginia for approximately $118.5 million, including $0.5 million of closing costs. Our credit facility is discussed in more detail in Note 7 Debt and Interest Expense, 2011 Credit Facility, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. We purchased marketable securities of $79.0 million and received $546.0 million from maturities and sales of marketable securities in 2011. We purchased marketable securities of $787.7 million and received $284.6 45 Table of Contents million from maturities and sales of marketable securities in 2010. There were no purchases or sales of marketable securities in 2009. We received distributions aggregating to $25.2 million and $129.5 million from certain investment funds in 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs. In summary, our cash flows for 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 335,901 $ 215,206 $ 395,191 Net cash provided by investing activities 273,242 603,090 484,455 Net cash used in financing activities (852,198 ) (745,274 ) (197,994 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (3,224 ) 9,440 6,446 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (246,279 ) $ 82,462 $ 688,098 Net cash provided by operating activities Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes and facilities. 2011 compared to 2010: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher income taxes payable in 2010, primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the Authentication Services business, before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of RSUs and a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees. The increase was offset by a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues due to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business in 2010. 2010 compared to 2009: Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues, including decreased revenues from discontinued operations, coupled with the timing of receipts from customers; higher income taxes payable, primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the Authentication Services business, before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of RSUs; and the payment of contingent interest on the Convertible Debentures. The decrease is partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees, primarily resulting from the completion of our divestitures in 2010 and 2009, and lower average headcount in 2010; an increase in interest income resulting from investments in higher interest rate marketable securities; and an increase in income from transition services agreements, primarily due to an increase in transition services provided to support certain divestitures in 2010 and 2009. Net cash provided by investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses, timing of purchases, maturities and sales of investments, and purchases of property and equipment. 2011 compared to 2010: The decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of businesses in 2010, and the purchase of our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia in 2011, partially offset by an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities. 46 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009: Net cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in proceeds received upon divestiture of businesses, an increase in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment. The increase is partially offset by an increase in purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds received from sale of an office building in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings from our credit facility, stock repurchases, stock option exercises, our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, and dividend payments. 2011 compared to 2010: Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and a decrease in realized excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of RSUs. The increase is partially offset by $100.0 million borrowed under our credit facility in 2011 and a lower special dividend paid in 2011 compared to 2010. 2010 compared to 2009: Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to the payment of a special dividend in December 2010, and an increase in stock repurchases. The increase is partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and the ESPP and an increase in realized carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of RSUs. Impact of Inflation We believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Property and Equipment Expenditures Our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be between 7% and 10% of revenue and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio. Contractual Obligations See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, Leases and Purchase Obligations and Contractual Agreements, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. We enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business. We also entered into indemnification agreements with Symantec in connection with the sale of the Authentication Services business. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, Indemnifications, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements. See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, Off Balance Sheet Arrangements, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding off balance sheet arrangements. Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Grants of stock based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We 47 Table of Contents recognize that these stock based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of December 31, 2011, there are a total of 3.4 million of unvested RSUs and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 2.1%. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all RSUs vest and are settled. As of December 31, 2011, 9% of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price. There were no stock options granted in 2011. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and RSU programs; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market risks. We have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Interest rate sensitivity The interest rates on our revolving credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, we had $100.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. The impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our interest expense in 2012. Our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2011 we had $32.9 million of fixed income securities, which consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government corporations and agencies. The impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments. Foreign exchange risk management We conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies. Our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with both monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies. The primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates. We may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. We do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates. The program may entail the use of forward or option contracts, which are usually placed and adjusted monthly. These foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings. As of December 31, 2011, we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling $39.7 million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements. Market risk management The fair market value of our Convertible Debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as 48 Table of Contents interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair market value of the Convertible Debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls. The interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the Convertible Debentures but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the Convertible Debentures was approximately $1.5 billion, based on quoted market prices. The fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on Convertible Debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk. Generally, the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the Convertible Debentures. 49 Table of Contents
