ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, primarily consisting of its investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Legal Contingencies The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect any reserves with respect to such legal proceedings. 42 Table of Contents As described further in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation and other matters arose from the Companys operations prior to the time of the Companys spin off of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) on May 1, 1998 (the 1998 Spin Off) or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the agreements entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy (the 1998 Spin Agreements), Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of certain defined claims. Kindred is presently defending the Company in these matters as required under the 1998 Spin Agreements, however, there can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations. A change in Kindreds ability to perform under these commitments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity of the Company and on the Companys ability to service its indebtedness and its obligations under the United States Settlement and on the Companys ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT (a Material Adverse Effect). The Company is also involved in other litigation as further described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is the opinion of management that the disposition of such matters will not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. If managements assessment of the Companys liability with respect to these actions in incorrect, such matters could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Income Taxes The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently reviewing the federal income tax returns of the Company for tax years ending December 31, 1997 and 1998. The IRS may challenge the Companys entitlement to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards (NOL Carryforwards). To the extent such NOL Carryforwards and escrow amounts under a tax refund escrow agreement (Tax Refund Escrow Agreement) between the Company and Kindred are not sufficient to satisfy such liabilities, if any, Kindred has indemnified the Company for certain, but not all of the tax liabilities under a tax allocation agreement between the Company and Kindred (the Tax Allocation Agreement). There can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of these matters with the IRS or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Additionally, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its indemnity obligations under the Tax Allocation Agreement. On January 16, 2003, the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue Agents report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report concluded that, pending final review by the Joint Committee of Taxation, the Company does not owe any additional taxes, and is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be deposited into a joint tax escrow account between Ventas and Kindred. The revised report is under review by the Joint Committee of Taxation. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 taxable net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the quarter ended September 30, 2002. A provision for income tax for the 2002 tax year was not recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 due to the Companys ability and intention to distribute to its stockholders at least 100% of its estimated 2002 taxable income. 43 Table of Contents Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The valuation of derivative instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair value for the Companys derivatives are obtained from a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the Company are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future. Results of Operations The Company elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Beginning with the tax year 1999, the Company believes that it has satisfied the requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT. The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2003 and subsequent years. It is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company were to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company would be subject to 35% federal income tax and to the applicable state and local income taxes for the affected years. Such tax obligations could have a Material Adverse Effect. Unless eligible for limited relief, if the Company failed, or revoked its election, to qualify as a REIT, the Company would not be eligible to elect again to be treated as a REIT before the fifth year after the year of such termination or revocation. Effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a 125 licensed bed skilled nursing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada and a 164 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia. The operating results of these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002 included herein. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 Rental income for year ended December 31, 2002 was $189.5 million, of which $186.5 million (98.4%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.5 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the Companys receipt of common stock in Kindred (the Kindred Common Stock) and the $4.5 million of additional future rent under the five master lease agreements (the Kindred Master Leases) with Kindred. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $183.3 million, of which $181.0 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The $6.2 million increase in rental income consists primarily of (a) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2002 and (b) additional rent received under the master lease (the THI Master Lease) with Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) entered into by the Company and THI properties on November 4, 2002. The Company reported two months of interest income from a mezzanine loan and senior loan of $1.0 million. The senior loan was sold in December 2002. Annualized interest on the mezzanine loan is expected to be approximately $3 million. See Note 6 Other Acquisitions and Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and other income totaled approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates. 44 Table of Contents Expenses totaled $146.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and included $42.0 million of depreciation expense and $78.4 million of interest on debt financing (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) and $5.5 million of interest on the United States Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2001, expenses totaled $149.2 million and included $41.8 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets, $86.2 million of interest on the Companys prior credit agreement (the 2000 Credit Agreement) and other debt and $4.6 million of interest on the United States Settlement. The $3.2 million decrease consists primarily of (a) a $7.8 million decrease in interest expense, and (b) a $2.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses and professional fees, which were offset by (x) an additional expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage (see Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (y) a $0.9 million increase in interest on the United States Settlement which was entered into on April 20, 2001, and (z) a $0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization. Interest expense excluding the interest on the United States Settlement decreased $7.8 million to $78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. $3.1 million of the decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal balances and $7.2 million relates to reduced interest rates resulting from the CMBS Transaction in December 2001, and the April 2002 closing of the 2002 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below). $0.6 million of the decrease is included in discontinued operations. The decrease is offset by a $1.9 million swap ineffectiveness expense recognized in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003 2008 Swap over the Companys anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Professional fees totaled approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of the Companys stabilized operations in 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal income tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 estimated taxable net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the third quarter ended September 30, 2002. In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $6.9 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. In December 2002, the Company incurred an additional $4.2 extraordinary loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock for an average net price of $43.39 per share and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $7.0 million as a prepayment of the Companys indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. As a result of Kindreds announcement relating to the Florida skilled nursing facilities and other events, the market value of the Companys Kindred Common Stock declined substantially in the fourth quarter of 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock with a market value of $16.7 million, or $18.15 per share. The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. On March 13, 2002, the Company sold a 125 licensed bed skilled nursing facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada to an unrelated third party for $1.8 million and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was reported as a 45 Table of Contents component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of $1.5 million as a prepayment of the Companys indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. On June 21, 2002, the Company sold a 164 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of approximately $22.4 million which was reported as a component of Discontinued Operations. The Company applied net proceeds of $27.1 million as a prepayment of the Companys indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. After income from discontinued operations of $23.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share and an extraordinary loss of $11.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $65.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share. Net income for year ended December 31, 2001 was $50.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share after discontinued operations of $0.7 million (or $.01 per share) and an extraordinary loss of $1.3 million (or $0.02 per share). Years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Net of total write offs, rental revenue increased $2.1 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $183.3 million, of which $181.0 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $1.7 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of Ventas Realty Limited Partnerships (Ventas Realty) receipt of the Kindred Common Stock and the $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. Net rental income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $181.2 million, of which $178.4 million (98.5%) resulted from the Leases with Kindred. In 2000, the outcome of the Kindred bankruptcy was uncertain, and the difference between the rent provided for in the prior Kindred master leases and rent actually received from Kindred was written off to uncollectible amounts due from tenants. Kindreds plan of reorganization (the Kindred Reorganization Plan) under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code terminated the Companys right to the payment of the difference between rent required to be paid under the terms of the prior Kindred master leases and the rent received by the Company after the date that Kindred filed for protection under chapter 11 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and prior to the beginning of the month immediately following the effective date of the Kindred Plan of Reorganization (the Kindred Effective Date). As a result, for the period from January 1, 2001 through April 30, 2001, the Company recorded revenue equal to the amount actually paid by Kindred under a stipulation entered into with Kindred at the commencement of its bankruptcy case. The Company included in its revenue computation for the period of May 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 the amount of rent due and payable under the Kindred master leases for that period. Interest and other income totaled approximately $4.0 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in interest was primarily the result of lower cash balances during the year as well as reduced market interest rates. Expenses totaled $149.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and included $41.8 million of depreciation expense, $86.2 million of interest on the 2000 Credit Agreement and other debt and $4.6 million interest on the United States Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2000 expenses totaled $301.5 million and included $42.0 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets and $93.6 million of interest on the 2000 Credit Agreement and other debt. The $152.3 million decrease in expenses in 2001 was due primarily to (a) a charge in 2000 of $96.5 million related to the United States Settlement, (b) a charge to earnings in 2000 of $47.4 million for unpaid rent from tenants, which primarily includes the difference between the minimum monthly base rent that would have been due under the terms of the prior Kindred master leases and the base rent that was paid under the terms of the rent stipulation entered into in connection with the Kindred bankruptcy, (c) decreased interest expense and (d) decreased professional fees. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the Company will pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% 46 Table of Contents per annum and is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge for the United States Settlement was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. Professional fees totaled approximately $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk and Note 11 Transactions with Kindred to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense, excluding the interest on the United States Settlement, decreased $7.4 million to $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $93.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal, reduced amortization of deferred financing fees and the favorable impact in the first quarter of 2001 of timing differences in the rate setting under the Companys interest rate swap agreement and the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2000, interest expense includes a $13.8 million payment on the 1998 Swap Agreement (as defined below). For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company received payments totaling $4.3 million related to the 1998 Swap, which offset interest expense. The IRS is currently reviewing the federal income tax returns of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998. On January 16, 2003, the Company agreed to a revised IRS Revenue Agents report quantifying the examination findings in connection with the 1997 and 1998 income tax periods. This report concludes that, pending final review by the Joint Committee of Taxation, the Company does not owe any additional taxes, and is entitled to an additional refund of $1.2 million, for the period in question. If received, this $1.2 million would be deposited into a joint tax escrow account between Ventas and Kindred. Until the review of the Joint Committee of Taxation is final, however, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters or whether such outcome will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. However, if there are any resulting tax liabilities, if any, for the tax years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 will be satisfied first from the use of Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforwards (including the NOL carryforwards that were utilized to offset the Companys federal income tax liability for 1999 and 2000) to satisfy those liabilities. As a result of the uncertainties relating to the Companys ability to retain its NOL carry forwards, the Company recorded a charge for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income which the Company did not distribute as a dividend. The $2.7 million tax provision reported for the year ended December 31, 2001 included a $0.7 million provision related to Ventas Realtys receipt of the Kindred Common Stock, of which 100% was taxable income to the Company in the second quarter of 2001. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. In connection with a registered offering of common stock by Kindred, Ventas Realty exercised its piggyback registration rights, and sold 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock, recognizing a gain of $2.6 million. The Company applied the net proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of the 83,300 shares of Kindred Common Stock as a prepayment on the Companys indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company distributed 334,886 shares of Kindred Common Stock as part of the 2001 dividend, resulting in a gain of $12.8 million. For every share of common stock of the Company that a stockholder owned at the close of business on December 14, 2001, the stockholder received 0.005 of a share of Kindred Common Stock and $0.0049 in cash (equating to one share of Kindred Common Stock and $0.98 in cash for every two hundred shares of common stock in the Company). For purposes of the 2001 dividend, the Kindred Common Stock was valued in accordance with the Code and applicable rulings and regulations on December 31, 2001 at $51.02 per share (the average of the high and low price on that day). 47 Table of Contents In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $50.6 million or $0.73 per diluted share after an extraordinary loss of $1.3 million (or $0.02 per share). After an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, as discussed above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $65.5 million or $0.96 per diluted share. Funds from Operations Funds from operations (FFO) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled $95.2 million, $93.5 million and $76.5 million, respectively. FFO net of the gain on the sale of the Kindred Common Stock and the net loss on swap breakage (Normalized FFO) for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $95.6 million and $78.1 million, respectively. FFO for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 is summarized in the following table: For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 In thousands Net income (loss) $ 65,706 $ 50,566 $ (65,452 ) Extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt 11,077 1,322 4,207 Income (loss) before extraordinary loss 76,783 51,888 (61,245 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 41,891 41,904 42,188 United States Settlement 96,493 Realized gain on sale of real estate assets (23,514 ) (290 ) (957 ) Funds from operations 95,160 93,502 76,479 Gain on sale of Kindred equity (5,014 ) (15,425 ) Net loss on swap breakage 5,407 Normalized FFO $ 95,553 $ 78,077 $ 76,479 The Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the NAREIT definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Companys financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Companys liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Companys needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of the Companys overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant 48 Table of Contents of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses the Companys integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk The following discussion of the Companys exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information. The Company receives revenue primarily by leasing its assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. The Company also earns revenue from the its mezzanine loan to THI. The Companys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement are (and its obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement were) floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general fixed nature of the Companys assets and the variable nature of the Companys obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the Companys lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company entered into the 1998 Swap to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a $425.0 million interest rate swap outstanding (the 1998 Swap) with a highly rated counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.985% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty. On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450.0 million (the 2003 2008 Swap) with a highly rated counterparty to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008, under which the Company will pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and will receive LIBOR from the counterparty to this agreement. The 2003 2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. There are no collateral requirements under the 2003 2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003 2008 Swap is scheduled to decline from $450.0 million as of July 1, 2003 as follows: Notional Amount Date $300,000,000 June 30, 2006 150,000,000 June 30, 2007 June 30, 2008 In accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement (as defined below), on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC (Ventas Finance) purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty (the Buy Cap). See Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Facility and Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the 1998 Swap and the 2003 2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the Sell Cap) for the same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Companys balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap. 49 Table of Contents When interest rates rise, the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the Company and when interest rates fall, the interest rate swaps decline in fair value to the Company. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the Buy Cap increases in fair value and the Sell Cap decreases in fair value. As of December 31, 2002, interest rates had fallen and the 1998 Swap and the 2003 2008 Swap were in an unrealized loss position to the Company. Generally, interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change. To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and caps to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2002: 1998 Swap 2003 2008 Swap Sell Cap Buy Cap Notional Amount $ 425,000,000 $ 450,000,000 $ 225,000,000 $ 225,000,000 Fair Value to the Company (9,842,703 ) (37,828,893 ) (1,285,574 ) 1,285,574 Fair Value to the Company ReflectingChange in Interest Rates 100 BPS (10,948,367 ) (55,990,510 ) (534,391 ) 534,391 +100 BPS (8,752,995 ) (20,626,126 ) (2,507,871 ) 2,507,871 The carrying value of the Companys variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates since the Company currently hedges 100% of its variable rate debt. The fair value of the fixed rate debt is $377.1 million based on open market trading activity provided by a third party. Credit Risk As a result of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company has a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 lease rental revenues from Kindred totaled $186.5 million or 98.4% and $181.0 or 98.7%, respectively, of the Companys total rental and investment income for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2000, lease rental revenues from Kindred comprised 98.5% of the Companys total lease rental revenues. Accordingly, Kindreds financial condition and ability to meet its rent obligations will largely determine the Companys rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Kindred, as well as certain other tenants of the Company, have experienced financial difficulty and or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. Since the Company derives in excess of 98% of its rental revenues from Kindred and since the Kindred Master Leases are triple net leases under which Kindred is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the Kindred leased properties, as well as a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See Business Risk Factors The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindreds inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company monitors its credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing (a) information regarding the healthcare industry generally, (b) publicly available information regarding tenants, (c) information provided by the tenants and borrowers under the Companys lease and other agreements, and (d) discussion with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2002, the Companys principal sources of liquidity came from cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the issuance of the Senior Notes as defined below, disposition of assets, the Equity Offering (as defined below) and, until the 2002 Refinancing Date (as defined below), the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company intends to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 million, restricted cash of $20.0 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Facility (as defined below), escrows under the THI Master Lease and the Companys portion of the amounts on deposit pursuant to the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement), outstanding revolving credit borrowings of $59.3 million under the 2002 Credit Agreement, and unused revolving credit availability of $185.3 million. Through the pledge of additional property as collateral to the lenders under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the Company, as of December 31, 2002, could have increased revolving credit availability to $231.0 million. Net cash provided by operations totaled $116.4 million, $79.9 million and $85.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 cash flows is primarily a result of (a) the timing of interest payments on the Senior Notes and the 1998 Swap, (b) increases from rent escalators and (c) reduction of interest expense. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. The Company invested $53.0 million in real property and $64.9 million in loan financing from the THI Transaction (as defined below) which was financed through borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Investing activities also included $49.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the THI Senior Loan (as defined below), $28.6 million from the sale of real property, $7.0 million from the sale of Kindred Common Stock and $2.0 million from origination fees. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $2.8 million included the proceeds from the Companys sale of 83,300 shares of Kindred common stock. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $5.4 million and included proceeds from the sale of two nursing facilities. Net cash used in financing totaled $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (a) an aggregate of $106.7 million payment of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement, the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $15.1 million in financing fees, (c) $12.8 million in swap breakage costs, (d) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (e) $10.8 million of principal payments on the United States Settlement. The financing uses are offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $97.2 million, including the net proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares (the Equity Offering) and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $151.5 million and included payments of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement in the aggregate amount of $263.0 million. $212.8 million of the payments were funded from the CMBS Transaction (as defined below), which generated gross proceeds of $225 million. The 2001 financing activities also included $6.9 million in financing costs, $41.7 million payment on the United States Settlement, and $65.3 million of cash dividend payments. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash used in financing activities was $142.9 and included dividend payments of $42.4 million, repayments of borrowings of $87.9 million and deferred financing costs of $12.6 million. On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased $34.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes out of the proceeds of the Equity Offering. The Company purchased $783,000 of 2009 Senior Notes (as defined below) and $33,179,000 of 2012 Senior Notes (as defined below) in open market purchases. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported an extraordinary loss of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002. The Company has no current intention to repurchase any additional Senior Notes. 51 Table of Contents The 2000 Credit Agreement On January 31, 2000, the Company entered into the 2000 Credit Agreement. On April 17, 2002, the Company used the proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below) and certain borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, in addition to cash on hand, to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Use of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement. Tax Refund Escrow Agreement Kindred and the Company have entered into the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement governing their relative entitlement to certain tax refunds for the tax periods prior to and including May 1, 1998 (the Subject Periods) that each received or may receive in the future. Under the terms of the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, refunds (Subject Refunds) received on or after September 13, 1999 by either Kindred or the Company with respect to federal, state or local income, gross receipts, windfall profits, transfer, duty, value added, property, franchise, license, excise, sales and use, capital, employment, withholding, payroll, occupational or similar business taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax, but excluding certain refunds), for taxable periods ending on or prior to May 1, 1998, or including May 1, 1998 and received on or after September 13, 1999 (Subject Taxes) must be deposited into an escrow account with a third party escrow agent. The Tax Refund Escrow Agreement provides generally that Subject Taxes will be satisfied first from the funds in the escrow account (the Escrow Funds). To the extent that the Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy all liabilities for Subject Taxes that are finally determined to be due (such excess amount, Excess Taxes), the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay such Excess Taxes shall be determined as provided in the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement. Disputes under the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement, and the determination of the relative liability of Kindred and the Company to pay Excess Taxes, if any, are governed by the arbitration provision of the Tax Allocation Agreement. Interest earned on the Escrow Funds or included in refund amounts received from governmental authorities are distributed equally to each of Kindred and the Company on an annual basis and are accrued as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any Escrow Funds remaining in the escrow account after no further claims may be made by governmental authorities with respect to Subject Taxes or Subject Refunds (because of the expiration of statutes of limitation or otherwise) will be distributed equally to Kindred and the Company. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CMBS Transaction On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the CMBS Transaction). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the CMBS Loan Agreement), Ventas Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0 million (the CMBS Loan) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the CMBS Lender). The CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4651%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. Principal payments on the CMBS Loan were calculated based upon a 25 year amortization schedule using an assumed interest rate of 9.46% per annum. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $211.0 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium. On December 12, 2001, the Company used $212.8 million of the proceeds from the CMBS Loan to pay down a portion of the outstanding principal under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The Company recognized a $1.3 million extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter of 2001 relating to the partial write off of unamortized deferred financing costs as a result of the aforementioned prepayments under the 2000 Credit Agreement. 52 Table of Contents The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on the 40 skilled nursing facilities (the CMBS Properties) transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the Kindred CMBS Master Lease). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company. Ventas Finance is required to maintain or cause to be maintained the following reserve accounts under the CMBS Loan Agreement: (a) a debt service reserve account in an amount of $5.0 million to cover shortfalls in cash available for debt service on the CMBS Loan, (b) an imposition and insurance reserve for the payment of real property taxes and insurance premiums with respect to the CMBS Properties, and (c) a replacement reserve account in the amount of $1.58 million for the payment of the cost of capital improvements made to the CMBS Properties. The impositions and insurance reserve and the replacement reserve under the CMBS Loan Agreement are being funded and or maintained by Kindred as required under and in accordance with the terms of the Kindred CMBS Master Lease. If Kindred should be unwilling or unable to fund these reserves under the CMBS Loan Agreement, Ventas Finance will be required to fund and or maintain such reserves. Restricted cash at December 31, 2002 included $5.0 million related to the debt service reserve account for the CMBS Loan. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2002 Credit Agreement On April 17, 2002 (the 2002 Refinancing Date), the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement. Under the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the Total Commitments) consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the Tranche B Term Loan) and a $290.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than $50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the Tranche C Term Loan). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to increase the Total Commitments (in the form of term and or revolving loans) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million. The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan, the Tranche C Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may not collectively exceed either (a) the Borrowing Base (as described below) or (b) the Total Commitments. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding principal balance of the Tranche B Term Loan was $59.7 million and the outstanding principal balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $59.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, there was no Tranche C Term Loan. Amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility may be borrowed and reborrowed from time to time, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement; provided, however, that the Revolving Credit Facility matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2005. The principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan is payable in installments of $150,000 on the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning September 30, 2002, and matures and must be repaid in full on April 17, 2007. Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period (the Base Rate) or (ii) a fluctuating LIBOR based rate per annum (the Eurodollar Rate). The Applicable Percentage varies based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate. With respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, from the inception of the loan through December 31, 2002, the Applicable Percentage on the Eurodollar Rate was 2.75% and on the Base Rate was 1.25%. 53 Table of Contents Loans outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre payable without premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate are subject to customary breakage costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period. Ventas Realty has agreed to pay various fees in connection with the 2002 Credit Agreement, including without limitation, issuance fees for letters of credit and fees for the unused portion of the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility. Ventas Realty may permanently reduce or terminate the total committed amount of the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement. The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realtys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has guaranteed Ventas Realtys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realtys real property assets and any related leases, rents and personal property, and, at Ventas Realtys option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 59 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the Borrowing Base Properties). All 59 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1. The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i) sixty five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the obligations outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2002, the Borrowing Base was $304.3 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $119.0 million, and the remaining availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $185.3 million. Ventas Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing Base to increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and security interests encumbering such properties. The 2002 Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants and various potential events of default and is, among other things, cross defaulted with certain other indebtedness and obligations of Ventas Realty and the Company. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Senior Notes Offering On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the Issuers), completed the offering (the Senior Notes Offering) of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2009 Senior Notes) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the 2012 Senior Notes and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes). The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the Indentures) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1, 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, $174.2 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by certain of the Companys current and future subsidiaries as described in the Indentures (collectively, the Guarantors). The Senior Notes are part of the general unsecured obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of the Company and Ventas Realty, and rank senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and Ventas Realty. However, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement with 54 Table of Contents respect to Borrowing Base Properties and any future assets securing indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to approximately $222.7 million of indebtedness relating to the CMBS Transaction that is secured by the CMBS Properties. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a make whole premium as described in the Indentures. If the Company experiences certain kinds of changes of control, as described in the Indentures, the Issuers must make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase; provided, however, that in the event Moodys and S&P have confirmed their ratings of the Senior Notes and certain other conditions are met as set forth in the Indentures, this repurchase obligation will not apply. The Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Scheduled Maturities of Borrowing Arrangements The Companys indebtedness has the following maturities (in thousands): 2003 $ 3,159 2004 3,412 2005 62,990 2006 214,810 2007 57,300 Thereafter 366,038 $ 707,709 Use of Proceeds; Repayment of 2000 Credit Agreement On April 17, 2002, the Company used (i) the $400.0 million gross proceeds from the Senior Notes Offering, (ii) $220.3 million of borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement (consisting of $60.0 million of borrowings under the Tranche B Term Loan and $160.3 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) and (iii) approximately $14.3 million cash on hand to: (a) repay all outstanding indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, (b) pay certain closing costs, fees and expenses, and (c) pay a one time $13.6 million breakage cost relating to the termination of $350.0 million notional amount of the 1998 Swap. The $13.6 million breakage cost is composed of (i) a $12.8 million swap breakage fee and (ii) $0.8 million of accrued interest on the terminated $350.0 million notional amount for the period April 1, 2002 through April 17, 2002. The Company recorded a $6.9 million extraordinary loss in the quarter ended June 30, 2002 to write off unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the 2000 Credit Agreement. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). The Company declared dividends greater than 100% of its estimated taxable income for 2002. The Company declared or assigned dividends equal to or greater than 100% of its taxable income for 2001 and 95% for 2000. The Company intends to pay a dividend for 2003 equal to $1.07 per common share, but not less than 100% of the Companys taxable income for 2003. The Company intends to pay the 2003 dividend with cash but may also pay by a combination of cash and other property or securities, including shares of Kindred Common Stock. It is expected that the Companys REIT taxable income will be less than its cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. However, for 2001 this was 55 Table of Contents partially offset by the value of the Kindred Common Stock received by the Company on the Kindred Effective Date which is included in taxable income in 2001. The Company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. It is possible, however, that the Company, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the Companys tenants. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, the Company anticipates that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which it may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, the Companys liquidity may be affected adversely. The Companys ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of the 2002 Credit Agreement and the Indentures. Shelf Registration Statement and Equity Offering On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $651.0 million of these securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company commenced and completed an equity offering of the Companys common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (Tenet). Immediately prior to the completion of the Equity Offering, Tenet held 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock. The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000 newly issued shares of common stock sold by Ventas and 8,301,067 shares of Ventas common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. After the Equity Offering, Tenet held no shares of Ventas common stock. The net proceeds received by Ventas from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6 million and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction. Agreement of Indemnity Third Party Leases and Contracts In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. The Company believes that the aggregate exposure under its third party lease obligations is approximately $36.4 million. The Company believes that it has no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. See Note 11 Transactions with Kindred to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the Company is required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on the Kindred Effective Date. The balance of $69.6 million bears interest at 6% per annum and is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. The Company will be required to pay $16.2 million in principal and interest in 2003 under the United States Settlement. 56 Table of Contents The Company has outstanding loans, with interest provisions of approximately $4.1 million, net of repayments, to certain current and former executive officers of the Company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the vesting of common stock of the Company awarded as compensation to such officers and the 1998 Spin Off. The loans are payable over periods ranging from a four to a ten year period beginning in each case on the date such loan was made.
