ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (Ventas or the Company). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates its long lived assets, primarily consisting of its investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. The Company adjusts the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value, if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment on one of its non operating skilled nursing facilities. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Contingencies The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. As described further in Note 13 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and other matters that arose from the Companys operations prior to the time of the Companys spin off of Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) on May 1, 1998 (the 1998 Spin Off) or relate to assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off. Under the various agreements (the Spin Agreements) entered into by the Company and Kindred at the time of the 1998 Spin Off, as such agreements may have been amended and restated in connection with Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, Kindred agreed to assume the defense, on behalf of the Company, of any claims 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements that (a) were pending at the time of the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership or operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, or (b) were asserted after the 1998 Spin Off and which arose out of the ownership and operation of the healthcare operations or any of the assets or liabilities transferred to Kindred in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, and to indemnify the Company for any fees, costs, expenses and liabilities arising out of such operations. Kindred is presently defending the Company in these matters, however, there can be no assurance that Kindred will continue to defend the Company in such matters or that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy such obligations. A change in Kindreds ability or willingness to perform under these commitments could have a Material Adverse Effect (defined below) on the Company. The Company is also involved in other litigation as further described in Note 13 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is the opinion of management that, except as set forth in Note 13 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the disposition of such matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of the Company, and on the Companys ability to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) (a Material Adverse Effect). If managements assessment of the Companys liability with respect to these actions in incorrect, such matters could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The valuation of derivative instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair value for the Companys derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2003, a provision for income tax was not recorded due to the Companys ability and intention to distribute to its stockholders at least 100% of its estimated 2003 taxable income and to continue to qualify as a REIT. The Companys estimation of its 2003 taxable income and the related quarterly dividends is based on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following: Kindred performs its obligations under the five master lease agreements pursuant to which the Company leases 41 of its hospitals and 186 of its skilled nursing facilities to Kindred (the Kindred Master Leases), and the Spin Agreements; the Companys other tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the Company; no capital transactions, acquisitions or divestitures occur; the Companys tax and accounting positions do not change; and the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock remain relatively unchanged. These assumptions which impact the estimate of the Companys 2003 taxable income are subject to change and many are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Companys expectations regarding future dividends may change. Although the Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause the Company to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company were to fail, or elect not, to continue to qualify as a REIT in any year, the Company would be subject to 35% federal income tax and to the applicable state and local income taxes for the affected years. Such tax obligations would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Unless eligible for limited relief, if the Company failed, or revoked its election, to qualify as a REIT, the Company would not be eligible to elect again to be treated as a REIT before the fifth year after the year of such termination or revocation. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Effective January 1, 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. The operating results of properties, that were disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2002, have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2003 included herein. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 1, and Technical Correction (SFAS No. 145). SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt (SFAS No. 4), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 that related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 required the Company to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As required, on January 1, 2003 the Company adopted SFAS No. 145. In accordance with SFAS No. 145, the Companys prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing operations. This reclassification has no effect on the Companys net income. Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $191.2 million, of which $183.2 million (95.8%) resulted from the Kindred Master Leases. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the Companys receipt of Kindred common stock (the Kindred Common Stock) under the Kindred Plan of Reorganization (the Final Plan) on April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $176.0 million, of which $172.9 million (98.3%) resulted from Kindred Master Leases. The $15.2 million increase in rental income reflects (a) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2003, (b) the $8.6 million increase on annualized rent on certain Kindred facilities effective July 1, 2003 and (c) $6.0 million in additional rent earned during the year ended December 31, 2003 under the master lease (the THI Master Lease) with Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) entered into by the Company and THI on November 4, 2002. Interest income from the real estate loan receivable was $3.0 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively. This amount represents interest income received in connection with a mezzanine loan made by the wholly owned operating partnership of the Company, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (Ventas Realty) to THI on November 4, 2002 (the THI Mezzanine Loan). Interest and other income totaled approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to the recovery of a previously written off receivable by the Company. In addition, the Company had increased interest income due to higher cash balances on hand to invest during 2003, which was partially offset by reduced interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company disposed of the remaining 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not own any shares of Kindred Common Stock. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Expenses totaled $108.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and included $39.7 million of depreciation expense, $61.8 million of interest on debt financing and $4.9 million of interest on the Companys settlement with the Department of Justice (United States Settlement). Expenses for the year included an offset of $20.2 million resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. Expenses totaled $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Excluding the $20.2 million offset, expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $19.6 million from the same period in 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from (a) a $9.2 million decrease in interest expense, (b) a $11.0 million expense in 2002 related to the loss from the early extinguishment of debt, (c) a $1.6 million decrease in Swap ineffectiveness, and (d) a $0.5 million decrease in the United States Settlement interest, offset by the net increase of $2.2 million in general and administrative expense and professional fees and a $1.3 million increase in depreciation expense. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to its operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) excluding the interest on the United States Settlement decreased $9.2 million to $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense includes $4.1 million and $3.7 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $3.1 million and $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (a) a $9.9 million decrease as a result of reduced debt balances, (b) a $0.4 million decrease from reduced interest rates, (c) a $1.6 million decrease in swap ineffectiveness (See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (d) a $1.5 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the Companys 1998 Swap (as defined below) which covered the period between July 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007. Due to the lower variable rate debt balances incurred by the Company as a result of the sale of ten facilities on December 11, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with the counterparty to the Companys 2003 2008 Swap (defined below) to break $120 million of the $450 million notional amount of the 2003 2008 Swap in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million. In addition, the Company recognized $3.4 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap. The $5.2 million net expense which was previously reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Balance Sheet has been recognized as a net expense in the Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company recorded an expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage (See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company recorded swap ineffectiveness in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003 2008 Swap over the Companys anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. The Company recorded $0.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under its prior credit agreement, in the quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Company incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with its prior credit agreement. In December 2002, the Company incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes (as defined below) consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement (defined below), the Company incurred a loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On June 30, 2003, the Company incurred a $2.7 million expense relating to the early repayment of the United States Settlement that is reflected as the United States Settlement interest expense on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. As required by GAAP, the United States Settlement has been, since inception, reported on the Companys balance sheet at an amount that is less than the actual unpaid principal amount under the United States Settlement because the 6% interest rate payable was deemed below market at the time of the settlement. The $2.7 million interest expense reflects the difference between the total amount paid by the Company in final repayment of the United States Settlement and the amount of the United States Settlement reflected on the Companys balance sheet on the date of final repayment. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges upon early repayment of the United States Settlement. General, administrative and professional fee expenses totaled $15.2 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Companys initiative to develop and market its strategic diversification program, to improve its overall asset management system, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve its business objectives. After discontinued operations of $66.0 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $162.8 million or $2.03 per diluted share. After discontinued operations of $28.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $65.7 million or $0.93 per diluted share. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the net income and gain on sale of real estate for properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2001 are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. On December 11, 2003, the Company completed the sale of ten facilities to Kindred, which facilities had until closing been leased to Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases, for $79 million in gross cash proceeds. A gain of $54.9 million was recognized and included in Discontinued Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, Kindred paid the Company a $6.0 million lease termination fee with respect to such properties. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale and the lease termination fee to pay breakage costs relating to the termination of $120 million notional amount of the 2003 2008 Swap. The remaining net proceeds were used to reduce the Companys outstanding indebtedness and to fund future acquisitions. See Recent Developments and Note 5 Dispositions. to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets sold by the Company to Kindred are: two hospitals located in Minnesota and Michigan, and eight skilled nursing facilities located in Kentucky, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Wisconsin. The hospitals contain 332 beds and the eight skilled nursing facilities contain 1,080 beds. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, the Company sold a non operating skilled nursing facility and received a non binding proposal to purchase another non operating skilled nursing facility. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $2.1 million on the sold facility and also recorded a $0.8 million impairment on the other facility. On June 30, 2003, the Company sold to Kindred 16 skilled nursing facilities, consisting of 15 properties in Florida and one property in Texas, which had previously been leased to Kindred under the Master Leases, for $59.7 million in gross cash proceeds. A loss of $5.3 million was recognized and included in Discontinued Operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. In addition, Kindred paid the Company a $4.1 million lease termination fee with respect to such properties. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale and the lease termination fee to repay in full all unpaid amounts under the United States Settlement. The remaining net proceeds were used to reduce the Companys outstanding indebtedness. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the second quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Company sold a skilled nursing facility to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was included as a component of Discontinued Operations. On June 20, 2002, the Company sold a 64 licensed bed hospital facility located in Arlington, Virginia to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $22.4 million which was also included as a component of Discontinued Operations. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $176.0 million, of which $172.9 million (98.3%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of the Companys receipt of the Kindred Common Stock and $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. The rental income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $170.6 million, of which $168.3 million (98.7%) resulted from leases with Kindred. The $5.4 million increase in rental income consists primarily of (a) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2002 and (b) additional rent received under the THI Master Lease. The Company reported two months of interest income from the THI Mezzanine Loan and a senior loan of $1.0 million. The senior loan was sold in December 2002. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and other income totaled approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates. Expenses totaled $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and included $38.5 million of depreciation expense and $72.9 million of interest on debt financing (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) and $5.5 million of interest on the United States Settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2001, expenses totaled $141.0 million and included $38.2 million of depreciation expense on real estate assets, $80.2 million of interest on the Companys prior credit agreement (the 2000 Credit Agreement) and other debt and $4.6 million of interest on the United States Settlement. The $7.1 million increase in expense consists primarily of (a) $9.8 million increase in the loss from the extinguishment of debt, (b) an additional expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage (see Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (c) a $0.9 million increase in interest on the United States Settlement which was entered into on April 20, 2001, (d) a $0.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization which were offset by (x) a $7.2 million decrease in interest expense and (y) a $2.0 million decrease in general and administrative expenses and professional fees. Interest expense (inclusive of swap ineffectiveness) excluding the interest on the United States Settlement decreased $7.3 million to $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. $3.1 million of the decrease is primarily a result of reduced principal balances and $7.2 million relates to reduced interest rates resulting from the CMBS Transaction (as defined below) in December 2001, and the establishment of the 2002 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the completion of the Senior Notes Offering (as defined below) in April 2002. $1.1 million of the decrease is included in discontinued operations. The decrease is offset by a $1.9 million swap ineffectiveness expense recognized in the Statement of Operations to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003 2008 Swap over the Companys anticipated variable rate debt balance in the future. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Professional fees totaled approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease relates primarily to the reduction in professional fees incurred as a result of the Companys stabilized operations in 2002 following Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy in 2001. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a provision for taxes on the 10% of its estimated 2001 taxable income that the Company did not distribute. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company filed its 2001 federal income tax return on which it elected to apply certain 2002 dividend payments in excess of its 2002 estimated taxable net income against such 2001 undistributed taxable net income. As a result, the Company recorded a $2.2 million tax benefit in the third quarter ended September 30, 2002. In connection with the refinancing of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred a loss of $6.9 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. In December 2002, the Company incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million in Senior Notes consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. In connection with the refinancing of a portion of its indebtedness under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $1.3 million related to the partial write off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the 2000 Credit Agreement. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company disposed of a total of 159,500 shares of Kindred Common Stock for an average net price of $43.39 per share and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. The Company applied net proceeds of $7.0 million as a prepayment of the Companys indebtedness under the 2002 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, the Company owned 920,814 shares of Kindred Common Stock with a market value of $16.7 million, or $18.15 per share. The Company disposed of 418,186 shares of Kindred Common Stock in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized a gain of $15.4 million on the dispositions. Discontinued Operations increased $24.6 million to $28.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is primarily attributable to a $22.4 million gain recognized in conjunction with the sale of a 64 licensed bed hospital facility on June 30, 2002. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Funds from Operations Funds from operations (FFO) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $152.6 million, $84.1 million and $92.2 million, respectively. FFO for the five years ended December 31, 2003 is summarized in the following table (in thousands): For the years ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 1999 Net income (loss) $ 162,753 $ 65,706 $ 50,566 $ (65,452 ) $ 42,535 Adjustments: Depreciation on real estate assets 39,436 38,243 38,089 38,303 38,071 Realized gain on sale of real estate assets (64 ) (290 ) (957 ) (254 ) Other items: Discontinued operations Real estate depreciation discontinued 2,223 3,648 3,815 3,885 4,671 Gain on sale of real estate (51,781 ) (23,450 ) Funds from operations $ 152,631 $ 84,083 $ 92,180 $ (24,221 ) $ 85,023 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, the Company considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and the Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus depreciation for real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Companys financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Companys liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Companys needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of the Companys overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses the Companys integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk The following discussion of the Companys exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the Company. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates as well as other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information. The Company receives revenue primarily by leasing its assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. The Company also earns revenue from the THI Mezzanine Loan. The Companys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement are (and its obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement were) floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The general fixed nature of the Companys assets and the variable nature of the Companys obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, the Companys lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet its debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company entered into a swap (the 1998 Swap) to effectively convert most of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations. Interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount. The 1998 Swap expired on June 30, 2003. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements Senior Notes Offering to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 28, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the 2003 2008 Swap) in the notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008. The 2003 2008 Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. The 2003 2008 Swap is with a highly rated counterparty in which the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.385% and receives LIBOR from the counterparty. On December 11, 2003, the notional amount of the swap for the period December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 was reduced from $450 million to $330 million. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the 2003 2008 Swap. The notional amount of the 2003 2008 Swap is scheduled to decline from $330.0 million as follows: Notional Amount Date $300,000,000 June 30, 2006 150,000,000 June 30, 2007 June 30, 2008 In accordance with the terms of the CMBS Loan Agreement (as defined below), on December 11, 2001, Ventas Finance I, LLC (Ventas Finance) purchased an interest rate cap from a highly rated counterparty (the Buy Cap). See Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Facility and Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the Company already hedged its consolidated interest rate risk through the 1998 Swap and the 2003 2008 Swap, on December 11, 2001 the Company sold an interest rate cap (the Sell Cap) for the same notional value ($225.0 million) and on the same terms (5 year amortizing 8% LIBOR cap) as the Buy Cap. If LIBOR should exceed the 8% cap, the Sell Cap would require the Company to pay the counterparty and the Buy Cap would require the counterparty to pay Ventas Finance for the interest accruing in excess of the 8% LIBOR cap. The Buy Cap and the Sell Cap are shown separately as an asset and a liability on the Companys balance sheet, respectively. The Company believes that the economic substance of the Buy Cap offsets the net cash flow exposure of the Sell Cap. When interest rates rise, the interest rate swaps increase in fair value to the Company and when interest rates fall, the interest rate swaps decline in fair value to the Company. Similarly, when interest rates increase, the Buy Cap increases in fair value and the Sell Cap decreases in fair value. As of December 31, 2003, interest rates had fallen and the 2003 2008 Swap was in an unrealized loss position to the Company. Generally, interest rate swap agreements with longer terms evidence greater dollar values of variation when interest rates change. To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swaps and caps to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2003: 2003 2008Swap Sell Cap Buy Cap Notional Amount $ 330,000,000 $ 220,111,775 $ 220,111,775 Fair Value to the Company (27,867,784 ) (389,572 ) 389,572 Fair Value to the Company Reflecting Change in Interest Rates: 100 BPS (40,364,325 ) (106,444 ) 106,444 +100 BPS (15,906,076 ) (980,694 ) 980,694 The Company paid $19.2 million under the 1998 Swap and 2003 2008 Swap during the year ended December 31, 2003. Assuming that interest rates do not change, the Company estimates that it will pay approximately $13.3 million on the 2003 2008 Swap during the year ended December 31, 2004. The carrying value of the Companys variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates since the Company currently hedges 100% of its variable rate debt. The fair value of the fixed rate debt is $405.6 million based on open market trading activity provided by a third party. Credit Risk As a result of the 1998 Spin Off, the Company has a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 lease rental revenues from Kindred totaled $183.2 million or 94.3% and $172.9 or 97.7%, respectively, of the Companys total real estate revenue for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2001, lease rental revenues from Kindred comprised 98.7% of the Companys total lease rental revenues. Accordingly, Kindreds financial condition and ability to 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements meet its rent obligations will largely determine the Companys rental revenues and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. Kindred, as well as certain other tenants of the Company, have experienced financial difficulty and or filed for bankruptcy. Kindred emerged from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001. Despite Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases. Since, as of December 31, 2003, the Company derived in excess of 95% of its rental revenues from Kindred and since the Kindred Master Leases are triple net leases under which Kindred is responsible for all insurance, taxes and maintenance and repair expenses required in connection with the leased properties, the inability or unwillingness of Kindred to satisfy its obligations under the Kindred Master Leases would have a material adverse effect on the condition of the Kindred leased properties, as well as a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. See Business Risk Factors The Company is dependent on Kindred; Kindreds inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with the Company could significantly harm the Company and its ability to service its indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to its stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company monitors its credit risk under its lease agreements with its tenants by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing (a) information regarding the healthcare industry generally, (b) publicly available information regarding tenants, (c) information provided by the tenants and borrowers under the Companys lease and other agreements, and (d) discussion with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2003 the Companys principal sources of liquidity came from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of real estate assets, sale of Kindred common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, and disbursements from a previously established tax escrow. The Company intends to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2003 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $82.1 million, restricted cash of $7.6 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Loan (as defined below), escrows under the THI Master Lease and the Companys portion of the amounts on deposit pursuant to the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement with Kindred (the Tax Refund Escrow Agreement)), and unused revolving credit availability of $261.8 million under its revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) established by the 2002 Credit Agreement. Through the pledge of additional property as collateral to the lenders under the 2002 Credit Agreement, the Company, as of December 31, 2003, could have increased revolving credit availability to $290.0 million. Net cash provided by operations totaled $137.4 million, $116.4 million and $79.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 cash flows is primarily a result of (a) increases from rent escalators, (b) proceeds from lease termination fees, (c) release of funds from a previously established escrow account (see Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (d) reduction of interest expense. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $159.7 million. The Company received $139.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties, which includes (a) $58.9 million from the sale of 16 properties to Kindred in June 2003, (b) $78.0 million from the sale of ten facilities to Kindred in December 2003 and (c) $2.3 million from the sale of a non operating skilled nursing facility. See Note 5 Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 also included $20.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred Common Stock. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. The Company 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements invested $53.0 million in real property and $64.9 million in loan financing from the THI Transaction (defined in Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc. to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which was financed through borrowings under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Investing activities also included $49.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the THI Senior Loan (defined in Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions Transactions with Trans Healthcare, Inc. to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $28.6 million from the sale of real property and $7.0 million from the sale of Kindred Common Stock. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $217.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The uses included (a) an aggregate principal payment of $67.1 million on the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $37.4 million payment in 2003 for the settlement of the repurchase of the Senior Notes that occurred on December 31, 2002, (c) $8.6 million in Swap breakage fees, (d) full repayment on the United States Settlement of $46.6 million and (e) $80.2 million of cash dividend payments. The uses were offset by $22.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing totaled $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (a) an net of $106.7 million payment of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement, the 2002 Credit Agreement and the CMBS Loan, (b) $15.1 million in financing fees, (c) $12.8 million in swap breakage costs, (d) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (e) $10.8 million of principal payments on the United States Settlement. The financing uses are offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $97.2 million, including the net proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares (the Equity Offering) and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $151.5 million and included payments of principal on the 2000 Credit Agreement in the aggregate amount of $263.0 million. $212.8 million of the payments were funded from the CMBS Transaction (as defined below), which generated gross proceeds of $225 million. The 2001 financing activities also included $6.9 million in financing costs, $41.7 million payment on the United States Settlement, and $65.3 million of cash dividend payments. On December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased through open market purchases $34.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes out of the proceeds of the Equity Offering, consisting of $783,000 of 2009 Senior Notes (as defined below) and $33,179,000 of 2012 Senior Notes (as defined below). The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, the Company reported a loss from the extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002. On February 5, 2004, the Company consummated a merger transaction in which the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ElderTrust in an all cash transaction valued at $184 million. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 28, 2004, the Company entered into 14 definitive purchase agreements with third party sellers to purchase a total of 14 independent and assisted living facilities for $115 million. On January 28, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of four of the 14 properties for a purchase price of $37 million. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CMBS Transaction On December 12, 2001, the Company raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the CMBS Transaction). Under a Loan and Security Agreement dated as of December 12, 2001 (the CMBS Loan Agreement), Ventas Finance obtained a loan in the principal amount of $225.0 million (the CMBS Loan) from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as lender (the CMBS Lender). The CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4853%. Principal of and interest on the CMBS Loan is payable monthly. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.3 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made on the CMBS Loan. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on 39 skilled nursing facilities (the CMBS Properties) transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the Kindred CMBS Master Lease). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non recourse to Ventas Finance and the Company. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2002 Credit Agreement On April 17, 2002 (the 2002 Refinancing Date), the Company, as guarantor, and Ventas Realty, as borrower, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the 2002 Credit Agreement). Under the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty obtained a $350.0 million credit facility (the Total Commitments) consisting of a $60.0 million term loan (the Tranche B Term Loan) and the $290.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. The 2002 Credit Agreement also permits Ventas Realty to obtain an additional term loan in an amount of not less than $50.0 million, but not more than the remaining unused portion of the Total Commitments, subject to the conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement (the Tranche C Term Loan). Subject to the terms of, and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in, the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty has the option to increase the Total Commitments (in the form of term and or revolving loans) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million. Borrowings outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement bear interest at an Applicable Percentage over either (i) a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period, plus one half of one percent (0.5%) and (b) the Prime Rate (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in effect for the relevant period (the Base Rate) or (ii) a fluctuating LIBOR based rate per annum (the Eurodollar Rate). The Applicable Percentage varies based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the 2002 Credit Agreement). With respect to Tranche B Term Loans, the Applicable Percentage is (a) 2.50% for loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, and (b) 1.00% for loans bearing interest at the Base Rate. With respect to revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, from the inception of the loan through April 6, 2003, the Applicable Percentages were 2.75% for Eurodollar Rate loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans. Because of the Companys improved credit statistics, effective April 7, 2003, the Applicable Percentages under the Revolving Credit Facility were reduced to 2.50% for Eurodollar Rate loans and 1.00% for Base Rate loans. Loans outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement are pre payable without premium or penalty, provided that loans bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate are subject to customary breakage costs if repaid prior to the end of an interest period. The Company (and any other owner of mortgaged property securing Ventas Realtys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement from time to time) has guaranteed Ventas Realtys obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement. Such obligations are secured by liens on certain of Ventas Realtys real property assets and any related leases, rents and personal property, and, at Ventas Realtys option, may be secured by certain cash collateral from time to time. Currently, 54 real properties owned by Ventas Realty are mortgaged to secure the 2002 Credit Agreement (the Borrowing Base Properties). As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the 54 Borrowing Base Properties was $161.6 million. All 54 Borrowing Base Properties are leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1. The Borrowing Base under the 2002 Credit Agreement is, as determined at any time, an amount equal to the sum of (i) sixty five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the Borrowing Base Properties, plus (ii) one hundred percent (100%) of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The aggregate principal amount of the obligations outstanding under the 2002 Credit Agreement (including the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Tranche B Term Loan and the Tranche C Term Loan) may not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base. As of December 31, 2003, the Borrowing Base was $320.9 million, and the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the obligations under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $59.1 million, and the remaining availability under the 2002 Credit Agreement was $261.8 million. Ventas 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Realty may at any time include additional real estate assets (which must satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement) in the Borrowing Base to increase its remaining availability, up to the Total Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the 2002 Credit Agreement, Ventas Realty may also obtain a release of various Borrowing Base Properties from the liens and security interests encumbering such properties. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Senior Notes Offering On the 2002 Refinancing Date, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ventas Realty (collectively, the Issuers), completed the offering (the Senior Notes Offering) of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2009 Senior Notes) and 9% Senior Notes due 2012 in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the 2012 Senior Notes and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes). The 2009 Senior Notes and the 2012 Senior Notes were issued under separate Indentures, each dated as of April 17, 2002 (collectively, the Indentures) and mature on May 1, 2009 and May 1, 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $174.2 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount was outstanding under the 2012 Senior Notes. The Indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, the Company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). The Company declared dividends greater than 100% of its estimated taxable income for 2003. The Company intends to pay a dividend for 2004 greater than 100% of the Companys taxable income for 2004. It is expected that the Companys REIT taxable income will be less than its cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. The Company anticipates that it generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable it to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. It is possible, however, that the Company, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions Capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by the Companys tenants. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that it will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, the Company anticipates that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which it may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, the Companys liquidity may be affected adversely. The Companys ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of the 2002 Credit Agreement and the Indentures. Shelf Registration Statement and Equity Offering On June 19, 2002, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002 and was 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements amended August 13, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, $651.0 million of these securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, the Company commenced and completed an equity offering of the Companys common stock with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (Tenet). Immediately prior to the completion of the Equity Offering, Tenet held 8,301,067 shares of the Companys common stock. The Equity Offering consisted of 9,000,000 newly issued shares of common stock sold by the Company and 8,301,067 shares of the Companys common stock owned and sold by Tenet, all priced at $11.00 per share. After the Equity Offering, Tenet held no shares of the Companys common stock. The net proceeds received by the Company from its sale of its newly issued common stock were $93.6 million and were used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred by the Company to invest in the THI Transaction. Agreement of Indemnity Third Party Leases and Contracts In connection with the 1998 Spin Off, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. The Company believes that the aggregate exposure under its third party lease obligations is approximately $31.2 million. The Company believes that it has no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States Settlement. Under the United States Settlement, the Company was required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on April 20, 2001, the date the Final Plan became effective. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per annum and was payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. The Company was required to pay $16.2 million in principal and interest in 2003 under the United States Settlement. On June 30, 2003, the Company prepaid in full the principal amount owed on the United States Settlement. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges payable on account of the early repayment. The Company has outstanding loans with interest provisions of approximately $3.8 million, net of repayments, to certain current and former executive officers of the Company to finance the income taxes payable by them as a result of the vesting of common stock of the Company awarded as compensation to such officers and the 1998 Spin Off. The loans are payable over periods ranging from a four to a ten year period beginning in each case on the date such loan was made. See Note 15 Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on the Companys cash flow in the future periods.

(4) Consists of the maturity of $174.2 million of Senior Notes due in April 2009 and $191.8 million of Senior Notes due 2012. (5) This amount represents the equity portion of the ElderTrust Transaction which was consummated on February 5, 2004. In connection with the Companys spin off of Kindred in 1998, the Company assigned its former third party lease obligations to Kindred (the Third Party Leases). Kindred and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all claims against the Company arising out of the Third Party Leases. The Company does not expect to incur any liability under the Third Party Leases. However, there can be no assurance Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor, its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the Third Party Leases.
