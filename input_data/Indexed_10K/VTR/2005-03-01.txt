ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Key transactions that we completed in 2004; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Accounting policies that we adopted in 2004, 2003 and 2002; Our results of operations for the last three years; Our liquidity and capital resources; and Our funds from operations. Key Transactions in 2004 During 2004, we completed the following key transactions: We acquired all of the outstanding common shares of ElderTrust in a cash transaction valued at $184.0 million, inclusive of $33.5 million in unrestricted and restricted cash; We acquired 15 facilities now leased by affiliates of Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. for a purchase price of $157.4 million; We acquired an additional 11 facilities from various sellers for an aggregate purchase price of $109.2 million; We issued $125 million of 6 5/8% unsecured senior notes, maturing on October 15, 2014; We obtained a new $300 million secured revolving credit facility initially priced at 125 basis points over LIBOR, an improvement over our previous revolving credit facility which was initially priced at 275 basis points over LIBOR; and We raised $51.1 million of equity with the public sale of two million shares of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Long Lived Assets Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships. Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis, and amortize the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and amortize such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements (the Kindred Master Leases) with Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Kindred), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Legal Contingencies We are involved in litigation as described in Note 13 Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate such matters by (i) ascertaining the probability that such litigation could result in a loss for us and (ii) determining an estimate of any possible loss. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue for any probable losses that are estimable and disclose any loss contingencies that are possible. If managements assessment of our liability with respect to these actions is incorrect, such matters could have a material adverse effect on us. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant which utilizes pricing models that consider forward yield curves and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future. Adoption of Accounting Policies In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB Opinion No. 25). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). As required under SFAS No. 123(R), we expect to adopt the provisions of this accounting standard on July 1, 2005. We expect to apply the modified prospective method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopt the accounting standard for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date. As permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to result in an immaterial increase in expense during the second half of 2005 based on unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and current compensation plans. While the effect of adoption depends on the level of share based payments granted in the future and unvested grants on the date we adopt SFAS No. 123(R), the effect of this accounting standard on our prior operating results would approximate the effect of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share. See Note 9 Stockholders Equity and Stock Options of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Correction (SFAS 145). SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt (SFAS 4), required that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item. The provisions of SFAS 145 that relate to the rescission of SFAS 4 required us to reclassify certain prior period items that no longer meet the extraordinary classification into continuing operations. Additionally, future gains and losses related to debt extinguishment may be required to be classified as income from continuing operations. The provisions of SFAS 145 relating to the rescission of SFAS 4 became effective in fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. As required, on January 1, 2003 we adopted SFAS 145. In accordance with SFAS 145, our prior year financial statements have been reclassified to include gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in continuing operations. This reclassification has no effect on our net income. 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), SFAS 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. SFAS 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed or are classified as held for sale. The operating results of properties that were disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2002 have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for each of the three years ended December 31, 2004 included herein. See Note 5 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute and percentage change in those results from year to year. Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2004 2003 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 232,911 $ 189,987 $ 42,924 22.6 % Interest income from loan receivable 2,958 3,036 (78 ) (2.6 ) Interest and other income 987 1,696 (709 ) (41.8 ) Total revenues 236,856 194,719 42,137 21.6 Expenses: Property level operating expenses 1,337 1,337 General, administrative and professional fees 16,917 15,158 1,759 11.6 Reversal of contingent liability (20,164 ) 20,164 100.0 Amortization of restricted stock grants 1,207 1,274 (67 ) (5.3 ) Depreciation 49,035 39,500 9,535 24.1 Net loss on swap breakage 5,168 (5,168 ) (100.0 ) Interest 66,817 61,660 5,157 8.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,370 84 1,286 1531.0 Interest on United States Settlement 4,943 (4,943 ) (100.0 ) Total expenses 136,683 107,623 29,060 27.0 Operating income 100,173 87,096 13,077 15.0 Gain on sale of Kindred common stock 9,039 (9,039 ) (100.0 ) Income before discontinued operations 100,173 96,135 4,038 4.2 Discontinued operations 20,727 66,618 (45,891 ) (68.9 ) Net income $ 120,900 $ 162,753 $ (41,853 ) (25.7 )% Revenues The increase in our 2004 rental income reflects (i) a $10.4 million increase resulting from the 3.5% annual increase in the rent paid under Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2004, and the rent increase from the July 1, 2003 amendment to the Kindred Master Leases, and (ii) the recognition of $32.1 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2004. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock in connection with Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. Interest income from loan receivable represents interest income received in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) on November 4, 2002. As of February 15, 2005, the mezzanine loan amount outstanding was $12.4 million. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily attributable to the recovery in 2003 of a previously written off receivable. Expenses The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is primarily attributable to costs associated with our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See Note 10 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2004. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the sale of 10 facilities on December 11, 2003, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to break $120.0 million of the $450.0 million notional amount in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million. In addition, we recognized $3.4 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. The $5.2 million net expense, which was previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was recognized as a net expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest expense includes $3.9 million and $4.1 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $0.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total interest expense, excluding interest on the United States settlement but including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $2.0 million in 2004 over 2003. The increase in interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (i) a $6.6 million increase related to the assumed debt for the ElderTrust merger and Brookdale transactions partially offset by, (ii) a $3.2 million decrease from lower effective interest rates, (iii) a $0.8 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of our previous $800.0 million notional amount interest rate swap (the 1998 Swap), (iv) a $0.3 million decrease from reduced principal balances of our existing debt and (v) a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs. In September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Interest expense on our settlement with the United States Department of Justice declined to zero in 2004 from $4.9 million in 2003 due to full prepayment in 2003. On June 30, 2003, we incurred a $2.7 million non cash expense relating to the early repayment of the settlement that is reflected as interest on United States settlement on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. There was no prepayment penalty or other cash expense upon early repayment of the United States settlement. See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gain On Sale of Kindred Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of 920,814 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. Since the sale, we have not owned any shares of Kindred common stock. Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2004. Discontinued operations in 2003 includes the net income of 27 properties sold in 2003 and in 2004, whereas the discontinued operations in 2004 only includes the net income of two properties sold in 2004. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. In 2003, we completed the sale of 27 facilities for $139.2 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $51.8 million. In addition, the tenants paid us lease termination fees approximating $10.1 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred. See Note 5 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Year Ended December 31, Change 2003 2002 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 189,987 $ 174,822 $ 15,165 8.7 % Interest income from loan receivable 3,036 995 2,041 205.1 Interest and other income 1,696 1,178 518 44.0 Total revenues 194,719 176,995 17,724 10.0 Expenses: General, administrative and professional fees 15,158 12,913 2,245 17.4 Reversal of contingent liability (20,164 ) (20,164 ) Amortization of restricted stock grants 1,274 1,853 (579 ) (31.2 ) Depreciation 39,500 38,229 1,271 3.3 Net loss on swap breakage 5,168 5,407 (239 ) (4.4 ) Interest 61,660 72,384 (10,724 ) (14.8 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 84 11,077 (10,993 ) (99.2 ) Interest on United States Settlement 4,943 5,461 (518 ) (9.5 ) Total expenses 107,623 147,324 (39,701 ) (26.9 ) Operating income 87,096 29,671 57,425 193.5 Gain on sale of Kindred common stock 9,039 5,014 4,025 80.3 Income before provision (benefit) for income taxes, net gain real estate disposals and discontinued operations 96,135 34,685 61,450 177.2 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (2,200 ) 2,200 100.0 Income before net gain on real estate disposals and discontinued operations 96,135 36,885 59,250 160.6 Net gain on real estate disposals 64 (64 ) (100.0 ) Income before discontinued operations 96,135 36,949 59,186 160.2 Discontinued operations 66,618 28,757 37,861 131.7 Net income $ 162,753 $ 65,706 $ 97,047 147.7 % 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues The increase in 2003 rental income reflects (i) the 3.5% increase in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2003, (ii) the $8.6 million increase in annualized rent on certain Kindred facilities effective July 1, 2003 and (iii) $6.0 million in additional rent earned during the year ended December 31, 2003 under our master lease with THI. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock on April 20, 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. Interest income from loan receivable represents interest income received in connection with the THI mezzanine loan. The increase in interest and other income is primarily attributable to the recovery in 2003 of a previously written off receivable. In addition, interest income increased due to higher cash balances on hand to invest during 2003, which was partially offset by reduced interest rates. Expenses The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is primarily attributable to costs associated with our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, to improve our overall asset management system, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See Note 10 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded an expense of $5.2 million related to the loss on a $120 million notional swap breakage. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded an expense of $5.4 million related to the loss on a $350 million notional swap breakage. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense includes $4.1 million and $3.7 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $3.5 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total interest expense, excluding interest on the United States settlement but including interest allocated to discontinued operations, decreased $13.4 million in 2003 over 2002. The decrease in interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations was due primarily to (i) a $9.9 million decrease as a result of reduced debt balances, (ii) a $0.4 million decrease from reduced interest rates, (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in swap ineffectiveness (See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) a $1.5 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with a 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of the 1998 Swap. We recorded swap ineffectiveness in the Consolidated Statement of Income of $0.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to reflect the value of the excess of the notional amount of the 1998 Swap and 2003 2008 Swap (as defined below) over our future anticipated variable rate debt balance. In April 2002, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $6.9 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our previous revolving credit facility. In December 2002, we incurred an additional $4.2 loss related to the repurchase of $34.0 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums paid to repurchase. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On June 30, 2003, we incurred a $2.7 million expense relating to the early repayment of our United States settlement that is reflected as interest on United States Settlement on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. Gain on Sale of Kindred Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of 920,814 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we disposed of 159,500 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $5.0 million. Discontinued Operations The increase in discontinued operations is a result of a higher net gain on the sale of properties in 2003, offset by the loss of net income due to the sales. Discontinued operations in 2002 includes the net income of properties sold in 2002 and in 2003, whereas the discontinued operations in 2003 only includes the net income of properties sold in 2003. In the second quarter ended June 30, 2002, we sold a skilled nursing facility for $1.5 million in net cash proceeds to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $1.1 million which was included as a component of discontinued operations and we sold a hospital facility for $27.1 million in net cash proceeds to an unrelated third party and recognized a gain of $22.4 million which was also included as a component of discontinued operations. Funds from Operations Our funds from operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2004 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 120,900 $ 162,753 $ 65,706 $ 50,566 $ (65,452 ) Adjustments: Depreciation on real estate assets 48,647 39,216 38,012 37,855 38,068 Realized gain on sale of real estate assets (64 ) (290 ) (957 ) Other items: Discontinued operations Real estate depreciation discontinued 203 2,443 3,879 4,049 4,120 Gain on sale of real estate (19,428 ) (51,781 ) (23,450 ) Funds from operations $ 150,322 $ 152,631 $ 84,083 $ 92,180 $ (24,221 ) Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk We receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from the THI mezzanine loan. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. The general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, on September 28, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the 2003 2008 Swap). The swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. On December 11, 2003, due to our lower expected future variable debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the swap for the period from December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 from $450 million to $330 million. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under the swap. The notional amount of the swap is scheduled to decline from $330.0 million as follows: Notional Amount Date $300,000,000 June 30, 2006 150,000,000 June 30, 2007 June 30, 2008 To highlight the sensitivity of the interest rate swap and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): As of December 31, 2004 2003 Swap Fixed Rate Debt Swap Fixed Rate Debt Notional amount $ 330,000 N/A $ 330,000 N/A Book value N/A $ (582,251 ) N/A $ (366,038 ) Fair value (a) (16,550 ) (635,990 ) (27,868 ) (405,563 ) Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (a) 100 BPS (25,489 ) (672,024 ) (40,364 ) (427,663 ) +100 BPS (7,917 ) (602,641 ) (15,906 ) (384,922 ) 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (a) The change in fair value of the swap was due to the general increase in interest rates. The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to (i) the assumption of approximately $96.3 million in fixed rate debt as a result of our ElderTrust merger and acquisitions during 2004, the fair value of which approximated book value at December 31, 2004, (ii) the issuance of $125.0 million in Senior Notes (as defined below) in October 2004, the fair value of which was approximately $127.5 million at December 31, 2004, and (iii) general increase in interest rates. N/A Not applicable. We paid $13.3 million under the swap during the year ended December 31, 2004. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay approximately $7.7 million on the swap during the year ending December 31, 2005. The carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value. There is no cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates because we currently hedge 100% of our variable rate debt. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is $636.0 million, which is based on open market trading activity provided by a third party for our Senior Notes and based on rates offered for similar arrangements for our mortgage indebtedness. Credit Risk As a result of our spin off of Kindred in 1998, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred under the Kindred Master Leases. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Kindred accounted for $192.4 million, or 81.2% of our total revenues, and $182.0, or 93.5% of our total revenues, respectively. Accordingly, Kindreds financial condition and ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We are dependent on Kindred; Kindreds inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2004, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from equity and debt issuances, cash flow from operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and disposition of real estate assets, proceeds from stock option exercises, and proceeds from the Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to shareholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings. We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million, escrow deposits and restricted cash of $25.7 million (comprised of $5.0 million of reserves under the CMBS Loan (as defined below), $11.2 million that we paid into escrow as required under our mortgage agreements, a deposit of $9.5 million in connection with an IRS Section 1031 Exchange), and unused revolving credit availability of $251.3 million under our revolving credit facility. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CMBS Transaction On December 12, 2001, we raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of a commercial mortgage backed securitization transaction (the CMBS Loan). As of December 31, 2004, the CMBS Loan bears interest at a weighted average of LIBOR plus 1.4935%, with principal and interest payable monthly. The CMBS Loan matures on December 9, 2006, at which time a principal balloon payment of approximately $206.4 million will be due, assuming all scheduled amortization payments are made and no prepayments are made. The CMBS Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium. The CMBS Loan is secured by liens on 39 skilled nursing facilities transferred by Ventas Realty to Ventas Finance I, LLC (Ventas Finance) and leased to Kindred under a Kindred Master Lease (the Kindred CMBS Master Lease). Except for certain customary exceptions, the CMBS Loan is non recourse to Ventas Finance and us. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving Credit Facility We obtained a new $300.0 million revolving credit facility in September 2004 that replaced our previous revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a percentage ranging 1.05% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2004, borrowings under the revolving credit facility were bearing interest at LIBOR plus 1.25%. We also incur an annual facility fee of 25 basis points payable in quarterly installments. The borrowing rate on the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2004 was approximately 3.65%. Initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to refinance all of the amounts outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility and pay off the $60.0 million term loan under our previous revolving credit facility (the Tranche B Term Loan). Our current revolving credit facility matures in September 2007, subject to a one year extension. The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the revolving credit facility may not exceed either (a) the borrowing base (as described below) or (b) $300.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility (excluding outstanding letters of credit of $0.5 million) was $39.0 million and there was no term loan. Subject to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we have the option to increase our borrowing capacity to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was $290.8 million. The borrowing base is the sum of (i) sixty five percent (65%) of the aggregate appraised property value of the borrowing base properties, plus (ii) 100% of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The borrowing base properties are currently comprised of 44 owned or leased real properties, which are also mortgaged to secure the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, the borrowing base properties had a net book value of $113.5 million and were leased to Kindred pursuant to Master Lease No. 1. The agreement relating to the revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Senior Notes Offering In October 2004, we completed the offering of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due October 15, 2014 of our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation (the Issuers), in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the 2014 Senior Notes). In April 2002, we completed the offering of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due May 1, 2009 of the Issuers in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2009 Senior Notes) and 9% Senior Notes due May 1, 2012 of the Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the 2012 Senior Notes and, together with the 2009 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes). On December 31, 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2004, $125.0 million principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes, $174.2 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $191.8 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the 2014 Senior Notes offering, on January 28, 2005, we completed an offer to exchange the 2014 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are otherwise substantially identical to the outstanding 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer. The Senior Notes are subject to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 7 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2004 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2005. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions Except with respect to our medical office buildings, capital expenditures to maintain and improve the leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with the leased properties. After the expiration of the leases, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to make expenditures and borrow funds is restricted by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the Senior Notes. Shelf Registration Statement and Equity Offering On June 19, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to $750.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares and warrants. The registration statement became effective on July 8, 2002. On March 15, 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering under the shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. As of December 31, 2004, $599.1 million of securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002, we completed the sale of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock in a joint equity offering with Tenet Healthcare Corporation (Tenet). In the offering, Tenet sold all 8,301,067 shares of our common stock that it held. Our net proceeds from the sale were $93.6 million, which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred by us to invest in transactions with THI. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other In 2004, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with acquisitions of certain facilities and the ElderTrust merger. Outstanding facility level mortgage debt was approximately $100.5 million as of December 31, 2004. See Note 6 Mergers and Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000, we recorded a $96.5 million charge related to the United States settlement. Under the United States settlement, we were required to pay $103.6 million to the federal government, of which $34.0 million was paid on April 20, 2001, the date of Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy. The balance of $69.6 million bore interest at 6% per annum and was payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year term commencing on June 30, 2001. The charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 was discounted for accounting purposes based on an imputed borrowing rate of 10.75%. We were required to pay $16.2 million in principal and interest in 2003 under the United States settlement. On June 30, 2003, we prepaid in full the principal amount owed on the United States settlement. There was no prepayment penalty or other charges payable on account of the early repayment. We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of $17.7 million and $22.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options are primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 1.6 million as of December 31, 2004, from 2.6 million and 4.2 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $5.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 and $13.1 million for the year ended December 31 2004. Beginning in March 2005, we are offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. During 2004 we offered a 2% discount. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. We have outstanding loans to certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.2 million as of December 31, 2004, down from $3.8 million at December 31, 2003. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See Note 15 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $150.0 million and $137.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 cash flows is primarily a result of increases due to rent escalators and additional rent net of interest expense relating to the properties acquired during 2004. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $298.7 million. We invested $323.7 million in real property which was financed through borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand and sold two facilities for proceeds of $21.1 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $159.7 million. We received $139.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties and $20.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred common stock. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $34.1 million. We made a net investment in transactions with THI of $68.9 million, received $28.6 million in proceeds from the disposal of real estate properties, and received $7.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the Kindred common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The proceeds included (i) $125.0 million from the issuance of the 2014 Senior Notes, (ii) $64.2 million from the issuance of common stock; (iii) $39.0 million from net borrowings on the revolving credit facility and (iv) $17.7 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options. The uses included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $67.0 million on our Tranche B Term Loan, CMBS Loan and other mortgage loans, and (ii) $103.5 million of cash dividend payments. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net cash used in financing activities totaled $217.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The uses included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $67.1 million on our revolving credit facility and the CMBS Loan, (ii) $37.4 million payment in 2003 for the settlement of the repurchase of the Senior Notes that occurred on December 31, 2002, (iii) $8.6 million in swap breakage fees, (iv) full repayment on the United States settlement of $46.6 million and (v) $80.2 million of cash dividend payments. The uses were offset by $22.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon of exercise of stock options. Net cash used in financing totaled $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The uses include (i) a net of $106.7 million payment of principal on our revolving credit facility and the CMBS Loan, (ii) $15.1 million in financing fees, (iii) $12.8 million in swap breakage costs, (iv) $50.1 million of cash dividend payments, and (v) $10.8 million of principal payments on the United States settlement. The uses were offset by net proceeds of $97.2 million from the issuance of common stock including the net proceeds of $93.6 million from the issuance of nine million shares and $3.6 million from the exercise of stock options. On December 31, 2002, we repurchased through open market purchases $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes. The total purchase price aggregated $37.4 million. As a result of these purchases, we reported a loss from the extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods (in thousands). Total Less than 1year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5years Long term debt obligations (1)(2) $ 1,226,443 $ 64,014 $ 366,277 (3) $ 293,750 (4) $ 502,402 (5) Obligations under interest rate swap(2) 16,550 7,723 8,061 766 Operating lease obligations 1,364 379 771 214 Total $ 1,244,357 $ 72,116 $ 375,109 $ 294,730 $ 502,402 (1) Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.

(5) Includes $191.8 million outstanding principal amount of the 2012 Senior Notes, and $125.0 million of the 2014 Senior Notes. In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our third party lease obligations was approximately $26.0 million and that we have no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third party leases.
