ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Key transactions that we completed in 2005; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Accounting policies that we adopted in 2005, 2004 and 2003; Our results of operations for the last three years; Our liquidity and capital resources; and Our funds from operations. Key Transactions in 2005 During 2005, we completed the following key transactions: We acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Provident Senior Living Trust (Provident) in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion, which added 68 seniors housing facilities to our portfolio. We acquired seven seniors housing facilities from a new tenant who is a publicly traded seniors housing operator in two transactions valued at $104.5 million. We acquired eight seniors housing facilities from an existing tenant in five transactions valued at $104.0 million. We issued six first mortgage loans bearing interest at an annual rate of nine percent in the aggregate principal amount of $36.4 million. We issued $200.0 million of 6 1/2% unsecured senior notes, maturing on June 1, 2016; $175.0 million of 6 3/4% unsecured senior notes, maturing on June 1, 2010; $175.0 million of 7 1/8% unsecured senior notes, maturing on June 1, 2015 and an additional $50.0 million of our existing 6 5/8% unsecured senior notes, maturing on October 15, 2014. We repaid all obligations under our commercial mortgage backed securitization (CMBS) loan, which had an outstanding principal balance of $209.8 million at the time of the payoff. We raised $97.0 million in net proceeds through the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that 37 Table of Contents affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Long Lived Assets Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships. Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors including, (i) corporate and facility level financial and operations reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set for the in the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrow or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements (the Kindred Master Leases) with Kindred Healthcare, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Kindred), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future. Results of Operations The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute and percentage change in those results from year to year. Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2005 2004 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 324,719 $ 232,076 $ 92,643 39.9 % Interest income from loans receivable 5,001 2,958 2,043 69.1 Interest and other income 3,268 987 2,281 231.1 Total revenues 332,988 236,021 96,967 41.1 Expenses: Interest 105,581 66,105 39,476 59.7 Depreciation 87,848 48,865 38,983 79.8 Property level operating expenses 2,576 1,337 1,239 92.7 General, administrative and professional fees 23,104 16,460 6,644 40.4 Stock based compensation 1,971 1,664 307 18.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,376 1,370 6 0.4 Net gain on swap breakage (981 ) (981 ) nm Net proceeds from litigation settlement (15,909 ) (15,909 ) nm Contribution to charitable foundation 2,000 2,000 nm Total expenses 207,566 135,801 71,765 52.8 Income before net loss on real estate disposals and discontinued operations 125,422 100,220 25,202 25.1 Net loss on real estate disposals (175 ) (175 ) nm Income before discontinued operations 125,247 100,220 25,027 25.0 Discontinued operations 5,336 20,680 (15,344 ) (74.2 ) Net income $ 130,583 $ 120,900 $ 9,683 8.0 % nm not meaningful 39 Table of Contents Revenues The increase in our 2005 rental income reflects (i) the recognition of $85.9 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2005 ($59.5 million relates to the Provident acquisition), the full year effect in 2005 of properties acquired during 2004 (see Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and (ii) a $6.7 million increase resulting from the 3.5 percent annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2005. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of (a) Kindred common stock and (b) $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases in connection with Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy in 2001. Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, represents $2.0 million of interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) in 2002, of which $4.0 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2005, and $2.0 million of interest income on the six first mortgage loans made in 2005. During 2005, we invested $21.4 million in a portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans, on which we earned interest of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, the balance on the distressed mortgage loans portfolio had been repaid in its entirety. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to $1.3 million of fees associated with our investment in the portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans described above and $0.8 million related to the recovery in 2005 of a previously written off receivable. Expenses Interest expense includes $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $39.0 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily due to a $49.9 million increase from increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2005, partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.6 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 8.4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2005. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in property level operating expenses relates solely to a full year of activity for the seven medical office buildings acquired during 2004 and the acquisition of two medical office buildings in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable to costs associated with growth in our asset base, our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. In December 2005, we paid off our CMBS loan and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million from $330.0 million for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. 40 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See Note 14 Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Ventas Charitable Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation). The Foundation will be used to support charitable and philanthropic causes important to the communities in which we operate and to our employees. Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2005. Discontinued operations in 2004 includes the net income of two properties sold, whereas the discontinued operations in 2005 includes only the net income from one property sold. In 2005, we completed the sale of one facility for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximately $0.2 million. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2004 2003 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 232,076 $ 189,987 $ 42,089 22.2 % Interest income from loans receivable 2,958 3,036 (78 ) (2.6 ) Interest and other income 987 1,696 (709 ) (41.8 ) Total revenues 236,021 194,719 41,302 21.2 Expenses: Interest 66,105 61,660 4,445 7.2 Depreciation 48,865 39,500 9,365 23.7 Property level operating expenses 1,337 1,337 nm General, administrative and professional fees 16,460 14,673 1,787 12.2 Stock based compensation 1,664 1,759 (95 ) (5.4 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,370 84 1,286 1531.0 Net loss on swap breakage 5,168 (5,168 ) nm Reversal of contingent liability (20,164 ) 20,164 nm Interest on United States Settlement 4,943 (4,943 ) nm Total expenses 135,801 107,623 28,178 26.2 Operating income 100,220 87,096 13,124 15.1 Gain on sale of Kindred common stock 9,039 (9,039 ) nm Income before discontinued operations 100,220 96,135 4,085 4.2 Discontinued operations 20,680 66,618 (45,938 ) (69.0 ) Net income $ 120,900 $ 162,753 $ (41,853 ) (25.7 )% nm not meaningful 41 Table of Contents Revenues The increase in our 2004 rental income reflects (i) a $10.4 million increase resulting from the 3.5 percent annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2004, and the rent increase from the July 1, 2003 amendment to the Kindred Master Leases, and (ii) the recognition of $32.1 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2004. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The rental income from Kindred includes $2.3 million related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded as a result of our receipt of Kindred common stock in connection with Kindreds emergence from bankruptcy in 2001 and the receipt of $4.5 million of additional future rent under the Kindred Master Leases. Interest income from loans receivable represents interest income in connection with the loan to THI. The decrease in interest and other income is primarily attributable to the recovery in 2003 of a previously written off receivable. Expenses Interest expense includes $3.9 million and $4.1 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $1.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total interest expense, excluding interest on our 2000 settlement with the United States Department of Justice but including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $2.0 million in 2004 over 2003, due primarily to a $6.6 million increase related to the debt assumed in connection with our 2004 acquisitions of ElderTrust and certain facilities from Brookdale Living Communities, Inc., partially offset by (i) a $3.2 million decrease from lower effective interest rates, (ii) a $0.8 million decrease from the amortization of a deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of our previous interest rate swap, (iii) a $0.3 million decrease from reduced principal balances of our existing debt and (iv) a $0.3 million decrease in amortization of deferred financing costs Depreciation expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2004. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is primarily attributable to costs associated with our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. In September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the sale of ten facilities in December 2003, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to break $120.0 million of the then $450.0 million notional amount in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $8.6 million. In addition, we recognized $3.4 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with the 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. The $5.2 million net expense, which was previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was recognized as a net expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we reported an increase of approximately $20.2 million to our operating results, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability. See Note 11 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents No interest expense was incurred with respect to the United States settlement in 2004, as compared to $4.9 million in 2003, due to full prepayment in 2003. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on Sale of Kindred Common Stock During the year ended December 31, 2003, we disposed of 920,814 shares of Kindred common stock and recognized a gain of $9.0 million. Since the sale, we have not owned any shares of Kindred common stock. Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2004. Discontinued operations in 2003 includes the net income of 27 properties sold, whereas discontinued operations in 2004 includes only the net income of two properties sold. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. In 2003, we completed the sale of 27 facilities for $139.2 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $51.8 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $10.1 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Funds from Operations Our funds from operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2005 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Net income $ 130,583 $ 120,900 $ 162,753 $ 65,706 $ 50,566 Adjustments: Depreciation on real estate assets 87,406 48,477 39,216 38,012 37,855 Loss (gain) on real estate disposals 175 (64 ) (290 ) Other items: Discontinued operations Real estate depreciation discontinued 153 373 2,443 3,879 4,049 Gain on sale of real estate (5,114 ) (19,428 ) (51,781 ) (23,450 ) Funds from operations $ 213,203 $ 150,322 $ 152,631 $ 84,083 $ 92,180 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in 43 Table of Contents order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk We receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from our mortgage loans. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. The general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in September 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the Swap). The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385 percent and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. In December 2003, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the sale of ten facilities, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap for the period from December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 from $450.0 million to $330.0 million. In December 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of our payoff of the CMBS loan, we further reduced the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million for the remaining term of the Swap. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. As of December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the Swap was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008. To highlight the sensitivity of the Swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2005 and 2004: As of December 31, 2005 2004 Swap Fixed Rate Debt Swap Fixed Rate Debt (in thousands) Notional amount $ 100,000 N/A $ 330,000 N/A Book value N/A $ 1,594,322 N/A $ 582,251 Fair value (1) (1,580 ) 1,765,805 (16,550 ) 635,990 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (1) 100 BPS (3,847 ) 1,860,688 (25,489 ) 672,024 +100 BPS 634 1,677,903 (7,917 ) 602,641 (1) The change in fair value of the Swap was due to the reduction of notional amount in December 2005 and a general increase in interest rates. The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the issuance of approximately $600.0 million of fixed rate senior notes and the assumption of approximately $427.3 million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by a general increase in interest rates. N/A Not applicable. 44 Table of Contents We paid $6.9 million under the Swap during the year ended December 31, 2005. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay approximately $0.6 million on the Swap during the year ending December 31, 2006. We had approximately $208.2 million and $260.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2004 is primarily attributable to the refinancing of our CMBS loan with fixed rate senior notes, offset by additional mortgages assumed in connection with the Provident acquisition. The Swap currently effectively hedges $100.0 million of our outstanding variable rate debt. Any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of $100.0 million are subject to interest rate changes. However, pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $109.7 million as of December 31, 2005, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. As of December 31, 2005, there was minimal cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates on variable rate debt since we effectively hedged nearly all of our variable rate debt. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us. We may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. Our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Credit Risk As a result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998 and the Provident acquisition in June 2005, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Brookdale Senior Living). For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Kindred accounted for $199.1 million, or 59.8 percent of our total revenues, and $192.4 million, or 81.5 percent of our total revenues, respectively, and Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $76.2 million, or 22.9 percent of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, the financial condition of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; Kindreds or Brookdale Senior Livings inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2005, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from equity and debt issuances, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, disposition of real estate assets, proceeds from stock option exercises, and proceeds from the Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to stockholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings. 45 Table of Contents We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 million, escrow deposits and restricted cash of $59.7 million, and unused availability of $210.6 million under our revolving credit facility. CMBS Transaction In December 2001, we raised $225.0 million in gross proceeds from the completion of the CMBS transaction. In December 2005, we repaid all of our outstanding indebtedness under the CMBS loan in the outstanding principal amount of $209.8 million at the payoff date with the net proceeds from our sale of the 2016 Senior Notes (as defined below) and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Revolving Credit Facility In September 2004, we entered into a new $300.0 million revolving credit facility that replaced our previous revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a percentage ranging from 1.05 percent to 1.75 percent, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2005, borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at LIBOR plus 1.45 percent, resulting in a borrowing rate of approximately 5.83 percent. We also incur an annual facility fee of 25 basis points payable in quarterly installments. Initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to refinance all revolver balances and pay off the $60.0 million term loan outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility matures in September 2007, but may be extended at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for a period of one year. The outstanding aggregate principal balance of the revolving credit facility may not exceed either (i) the borrowing base (as described below) or (ii) $300.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility (excluding outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 million) was $89.2 million. Subject to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we have the option to increase our borrowing capacity (in the form of additional revolving loans and or a term loan) to an amount not to exceed $450.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was $300.0 million. The borrowing base is the sum of (i) 65 percent of the aggregate appraised property value of the borrowing base properties, plus (ii) 100 percent of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts. The borrowing base properties are currently comprised of 52 owned or leased real properties, which are also mortgaged to secure the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, the borrowing base properties had a net book value of $114.3 million and were leased to Kindred pursuant to the Kindred Master Leases. The revolving credit facility imposes various restrictive covenants on us. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Senior Notes Offerings In December 2005, we completed the offerings of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Senior Notes) of our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the Issuers) at a half percent discount to par value. In June 2005, we completed the offering of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due June 1, 2010 of the Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2010 Senior Notes), and 7 1/8% Senior Notes due June 1, 2015 of the Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2015 Senior Notes). In June 2005, we also completed the offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, which was in addition to the $125.0 million aggregate 46 Table of Contents principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes originally issued in October 2004. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes was issued at a one percent discount to par value. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture. In April 2002, we completed the offering of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due May 1, 2009 of the Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million (the 2009 Senior Notes), and 9% Senior Notes due May 1, 2012 of the Issuers, in the aggregate principal amount of $225.0 million (the 2012 Senior Notes). On December 31, 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2005, $174.2 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes, $191.8 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes and $200.0 million principal amount of 2016 Senior Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are subject to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes offerings, on October 28, 2005, we completed offers to exchange the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes with new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offers. Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offerings, on January 27, 2006, we filed a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 2016 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2016 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We will not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 percent of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100 percent of estimated taxable income for 2005 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100 percent of taxable income for 2006. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 percent distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 percent distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 percent distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. 47 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions Except with respect to our medical office buildings, capital expenditures to maintain and improve our leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes. Equity Offerings In 2002, we filed and the Commission declared effective a universal shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Commission relating to $750.0 million aggregate offering price of common stock, preferred stock, subsidiary debt securities and related guarantees, depository shares and warrants. In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. In March 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $501.0 million of securities remained available for offering under the shelf registration statement. Other During 2005 and 2004, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Provident and ElderTrust acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Outstanding facility level mortgage debt was approximately $622.3 million and $100.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2003 Consolidated Statement of Income includes a $4.9 million expense related to our early repayment of a prior year settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice. We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of $6.8 million and $17.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options are primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 1.3 million as of December 31, 2005, from 1.6 million and 2.6 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $5.0 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In March 2005, we began offering a one percent discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. During 2004, we offered a two percent discount. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. 48 Table of Contents We have outstanding loans to certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.8 million as of December 31, 2005, down from $3.2 million at December 31, 2004. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See Note 16 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $223.8 million and $150.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 cash flows is primarily a result of increases due to rent escalators and additional rent, net of interest expense, relating to the properties acquired during 2005. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $615.0 million. We invested $589.6 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the issuance of Senior Notes and cash on hand, and proceeds of $11.3 million from the sale of facilities, of which $9.9 million is being held in escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange. Additionally, we invested $47.3 million in real estate loans and received proceeds from our real estate loans of $20.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $298.7 million. We invested $323.9 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand, and sold two facilities for proceeds of $21.1 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $159.7 million.

The uses included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $67.1 million on our revolving credit facility and the CMBS loan, (ii) a $37.4 million cash payment in 2003 to settle the repurchase of Senior Notes that occurred on December 31, 2002, (iii) $8.6 million in swap breakage fees, (iv) full repayment on the United States settlement of $46.6 million and (v) $80.2 million of cash dividend payments. The uses were offset by $22.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. 49 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods.

In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2005, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our third party lease obligations was approximately $21.6 million and that we have no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third party leases.
