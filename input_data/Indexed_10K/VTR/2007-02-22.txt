ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Key transactions that we completed in 2006; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; Our liquidity and capital resources; and Our funds from operations. Key Transactions in 2006 During 2006, we completed the following key transactions: We acquired 64 senior care properties located in 15 states in a transaction valued at $602.4 million, and entered into a master lease agreement with a new tenant, Senior Care, Inc. (Senior Care). We acquired eight seniors housing communities from two existing tenants in five separate transactions valued at $74.3 million. We exercised our election to increase aggregate base rental under the four master lease agreements (the Kindred Master Leases) between us and Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) by $33.1 million per year pursuant to the Rent Reset contained in the Kindred Master Leases, resulting in new aggregate annual base rental on the 225 properties we lease to Kindred of $239.0 million. We entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility initially priced at 75 basis points over LIBOR, replacing our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility that was priced at 145 basis points over LIBOR. We issued $225.0 million of 6 3/4% unsecured senior notes, maturing on April 1, 2017, and $230.0 million of 3 7/8% convertible unsecured senior notes, maturing on November 15, 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 36 Table of Contents Long Lived Assets Investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land, buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary. Recognized intangibles, if any, include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships. Our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant, such tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with such tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant. We amortize such value, if any, over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility level financial and operations reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrow or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, excluding the Kindred Master Leases, but including the majority of our leases with subsidiaries of Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living 37 Table of Contents Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, Brookdale Senior Living), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectibility is reasonably assured. Stock Based Compensation In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB Opinion No. 25). Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123, except that SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under SFAS No. 123(R). As required, we adopted the provisions of this accounting standard on January 1, 2006. We applied the modified prospective transition method of adoption in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the date we adopted the accounting standard for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date. See Note 10 Stock Based Compensation of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had on our consolidated financial statements. Gain on Sale of Facilities We recognize sales of facilities only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Gains on facilities sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute and percentage change in those results from year to year. Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2006 2005 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 418,449 $ 324,719 $ 93,730 28.9 % Interest income from loans receivable 7,014 5,001 2,013 40.3 Interest and other income 2,886 3,268 (382 ) (11.7 ) Total revenues 428,349 332,988 95,361 28.6 Expenses: Interest 141,094 105,581 35,513 33.6 Depreciation and amortization 119,653 87,848 31,805 36.2 Property level operating expenses 3,171 2,576 595 23.1 General, administrative and professional fees(including non cash stock based compensation expense of $3,046 and $1,971 for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively) 26,136 25,075 1,061 4.2 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,273 1,376 (103 ) (7.5 ) Rent reset costs 7,361 7,361 nm Reversal of contingent liability (1,769 ) (1,769 ) nm Net gain on swap breakage (981 ) 981 nm Net proceeds from litigation settlement (15,909 ) 15,909 nm Contribution to charitable foundation 2,000 (2,000 ) nm Total expenses 296,919 207,566 89,353 43.0 Operating income 131,430 125,422 6,008 4.8 Net loss on real estate disposals (175 ) 175 nm Income before discontinued operations 131,430 125,247 6,183 4.9 Discontinued operations 5,336 (5,336 ) nm Net income $ 131,430 $ 130,583 $ 847 0.6 % nm not meaningful Revenues The increase in our 2006 rental income reflects the recognition of (i) $11.3 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2006 ($7.0 million relates to the Senior Care acquisition), (ii) $58.9 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2006 of properties acquired during 2005 ($46.4 million relates to the Provident acquisition), (see Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) $15 million of rental income resulting from the Rent Reset under the Kindred Master Leases, (iv) a $6.8 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2006 (prior to the Rent Reset) and (v) $1.7 million of additional rental income resulting from rent escalations on various other properties. 39 Table of Contents Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a bridge loan issued to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties, which bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% during the time the loan remained outstanding. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan, which was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care transaction in November 2006. This was partially offset by a net decrease of $1.7 million from interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. (THI) in 2002, as this loan was repaid in full in March 2006. See Note 7 Loans Receivable of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses Interest expense includes $3.3 million and $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $34.9 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily due to $40.7 million of additional interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2006, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2006 and 2005. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable primarily to the expensing of stock options as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) at the beginning of 2006. In April 2006, we refinanced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility and entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, resulting in a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In December 2005, we paid off our commercial mortgage backed securitires (CMBS) loan and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In connection with the Kindred Rent Reset process, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses. During 2006, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. During 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See Note 14 Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Ventas Charitable Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation) in 2005. The Foundation is used to support charitable and philanthropic causes important to the communities in which we operate and to our employees. 40 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations We did not make any dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2006. In 2005, we completed the sale of one facility for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. The income of the property sold, net gain and lease termination fee were included in discontinued operations. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2005 2004 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 324,719 $ 232,076 $ 92,643 39.9 % Interest income from loans receivable 5,001 2,958 2,043 69.1 Interest and other income 3,268 987 2,281 231.1 Total revenues 332,988 236,021 96,967 41.1 Expenses: Interest 105,581 66,105 39,476 59.7 Depreciation and amortization 87,848 48,865 38,983 79.8 Property level operating expenses 2,576 1,337 1,239 92.7 General, administrative and professional fees(including non cash stock based compensation expense of $1,971 and $1,664 for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively) 25,075 18,124 6,951 38.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,376 1,370 6 0.4 Net gain on swap breakage (981 ) (981 ) nm Net proceeds from litigation settlement (15,909 ) (15,909 ) nm Contribution to charitable foundation 2,000 2,000 nm Total expenses 207,566 135,801 71,765 52.8 Operating income 125,422 100,220 25,202 25.1 Net loss on real estate disposals (175 ) (175 ) nm Income before discontinued operations 125,247 100,220 25,027 25.0 Discontinued operations 5,336 20,680 (15,344 ) (74.2 ) Net income $ 130,583 $ 120,900 $ 9,683 8.0 % nm not meaningful Revenues The increase in our 2005 rental income reflects the recognition of (i) $59.5 million in additional rent relating to the Provident acquisition in 2005 and $26.4 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2005 of properties acquired during 2004 and the annual escalators in 2005 (see Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and (ii) a $6.7 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2005. Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0 million in 2005 primarily as a result of interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to THI 41 Table of Contents in 2002, of which $4.0 million principal amount remained outstanding at December 31, 2005, and interest income on the six first mortgage loans made in 2005. During 2005, we invested $21.4 million in a portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans, on which we earned interest of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, the balance on the distressed mortgage loans portfolio had been repaid in its entirety. The increase in interest and other income primarily relates to $1.3 million of fees associated with our investment in the portfolio of eight distressed mortgage loans described above and $0.8 million related to the recovery in 2005 of a previously written off receivable. Expenses Interest expense includes $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $0.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $39.0 million in 2005 over 2004, primarily due to $49.9 million of additional interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2005, partially offset by a $10.9 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2005. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in property level operating expenses relates solely to a full year of activity for the seven medical office buildings acquired during 2004 and the acquisition of two medical office buildings in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable to costs associated with growth in our asset base, our initiative to develop and market our strategic diversification program, engage in comprehensive asset management, comply with regulatory requirements such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives. In December 2005, we paid off our CMBS loan and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In September 2004, we refinanced indebtedness under our prior credit agreement at lower interest rates and incurred a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See Note 14 Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Foundation in 2005. Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of a lower net gain on the sale of properties in 2005. Discontinued operations in 2004 includes the net income of two properties sold, whereas the discontinued operations in 2005 includes only the net income from one property sold. 42 Table of Contents In 2005, we completed the sale of one facility for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. In 2004, we completed the sale of two facilities for $21.1 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a net gain on the sale of $19.4 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees approximating $0.5 million. The net gains and lease termination fees are included in discontinued operations for the respective years in which the dispositions occurred. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Funds from Operations Our funds from operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2006 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net income $ 131,430 $ 130,583 $ 120,900 $ 162,753 $ 65,706 Adjustments: Depreciation on real estate assets 118,238 87,406 48,477 39,216 38,012 Loss (gain) on real estate disposals 175 (64 ) Other items: Discontinued operations: Gain on sale of real estate (5,114 ) (19,428 ) (51,781 ) (23,450 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 153 373 2,443 3,879 FFO $ 249,668 $ 213,203 $ 150,322 $ 152,631 $ 84,083 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity real estate investment trust (REIT) and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute 43 Table of Contents levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk We receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from our mortgage loans. Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR. The general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in September 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the Swap). The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. In 2003 and 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $330.0 million and then to $100.0 million for the remaining term of the Swap. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. As of December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the Swap was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008. To highlight the sensitivity of the Swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates: As of December 31, 2006 2005 (in thousands) Swap Fixed Rate Debt Swap Fixed Rate Debt Notional amount $ 100,000 N/A $ 100,000 N/A Gross book value N/A $ 2,052,293 N/A $ 1,594,322 Fair value (1) (429 ) 2,190,949 (1,580 ) 1,765,805 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (1) 100 BPS (1,725 ) 2,301,226 (3,847 ) 1,860,688 +100 BPS 830 2,088,514 634 1,677,903 (1) The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the issuance of approximately $455.0 million of fixed rate senior notes and the assumption of approximately $10.8 million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by a general increase in interest rates. N/A Not applicable. We paid $0.3 million under the Swap during the year ended December 31, 2006. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay less than $0.1 million on the Swap during the year ending December 31, 2007. We had approximately $284.7 million and $208.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2005 is primarily attributable to the assumption of $114.8 million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the Senior Care transaction that was repaid on January 2, 2007, offset by a reduction in our outstanding balance on the unsecured revolving credit facility. The Swap currently effectively hedges $100.0 million of our outstanding variable rate debt. Any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of $100.0 million are subject to interest rate changes. However, pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $218.4 million as of December 31, 2006, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from 44 Table of Contents the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. As of December 31, 2006, there was minimal cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates on variable rate debt since we effectively hedged nearly all of our variable rate debt. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us. We may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. Our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Credit Risk As a result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998 and the Provident acquisition in June 2005, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, Kindred accounted for $220.9 million, or 51.6% of our total revenues, and $199.1 million, or 59.8% of our total revenues, respectively, and Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $122.7 million, or 28.6% of our total revenues, and $76.2 million, or 22.9% of our total revenues, respectively. Accordingly, the financial condition of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; Kindreds or Brookdale Senior Livings inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a REIT included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from debt issuances, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our unsecured and previous secured revolving credit facilities, proceeds from stock option exercises, and proceeds from the Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to stockholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings. We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, disposition of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 million, escrow deposits and restricted cash of $80.0 million, and unused availability of $442.8 million under our revolving credit facility. We expect to fund the Sunrise REIT acquisition through a fully committed bridge facility, composed of a $1.0 billion senior interim loan and a $600.0 million senior perpetual preferred stock issuance, and or some combination of proceeds from asset sales (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties), borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility, mortgage loans assumptions and other sources. 45 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facilities In April 2006, we entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility). The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility replaced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility. The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility matures in 2009, with a one year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and contains a $100.0 million accordion feature that permits us to increase our total borrowing capacity to $600.0 million. In February 2007, we gave notice of our intention to exercise the full amount of this accordion feature. We anticipate completing this transaction by the end of the first quarter, although there can be no assurance that it will close or, if it does, when the closing will occur. Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage, initially 0.75%. At December 31, 2006, the applicable percentage was 0.75%. Our previous secured revolving credit facility also bore interest at a fluctuating LIBOR based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage. The applicable percentage for the previous secured revolving credit facility was 1.45% from January 1, 2006 until its replacement in April 2006. Convertible Senior Notes In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 7/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds $45.07 per share, adjusted downward in the case of quarterly dividends in excess of $0.395 per share, our earnings per share will be diluted. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering, we agreed to file a registration statement covering resales by the holders of shares of our common stock, if any, issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales. Senior Notes Offerings In September 2006, we completed the offering of $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Senior Notes) of Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the Issuers) at a 5/8% discount to par value. In December 2005, we completed the offerings of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Senior Notes) of the Issuers at a 1/2% discount to par value. In June 2005, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2010 (the 2010 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, and $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Senior Notes) of the Issuers. In June 2005, we also completed the offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, which was in addition to the $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes originally issued in October 2004. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes was issued at a 1% discount to par value. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture. 46 Table of Contents In April 2002, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 (the 2009 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, and $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 2012 Senior Notes) of the Issuers. In December 2002, we purchased $0.8 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes and $33.2 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2006, $174.2 million principal amount of 2009 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes, $191.8 million principal amount of 2012 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes, $175.0 million principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million principal amount of 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million principal amount of the 2017 Senior Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes. The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes are subject to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes offerings, on October 28, 2005, we completed offers to exchange the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes with new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offers. Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offerings, on April 7, 2006, we completed an offer to exchange the 2016 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2016 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2005 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2006. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Capital Expenditures and Property Acquisitions Except with respect to our medical office buildings and the properties we expect to acquire in connection with our proposed acquisition of Sunrise REIT, assuming the transaction closes (see Note 18 Subsequent Events of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), capital expenditures to maintain and improve our 47 Table of Contents leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these leased properties. After the terms of the leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes. Equity Offerings In April 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Commission relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0 million of securities remained available for offering. In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. In March 2004, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous universal shelf registration statement. We received $51.1 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. Other During 2006 and 2005, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Senior Care and Provident acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Outstanding facility level mortgage debt was approximately $734.0 million (of that amount, $114.4 million was repaid in January 2007) and $622.3 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of $6.6 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 1.1 million as of December 31, 2006, from 1.3 million and 1.6 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $0.8 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. We have outstanding loans to certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.5 million as of December 31, 2006, down from $2.8 million at December 31, 2005. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See Note 16 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 48 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $238.9 million and $223.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 cash flows is primarily a result of increases due to rent escalators and additional rent, net of interest expense, relating to the properties acquired during 2006 and the Rent Reset from the Kindred Master Leases. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $482.0 million. We invested $490.7 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility, the issuance of the Convertible Notes and $225.0 million of Senior Notes and cash on hand, and proceeds of $9.9 million released from escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange. Additionally, we invested $191.1 million in real estate loans and received proceeds from our real estate loans of $195.4 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $615.0 million. We invested $589.6 million in real property, which was financed through borrowings under our previous secured revolving credit facility, the issuance of $400.0 million of Senior Notes, proceeds of $97.0 million from our equity offering and cash on hand, and proceeds of $11.3 million from the sale of facilities, of which $9.9 million was held in escrow for use in an Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 exchange and subsequently released. Additionally, we invested $47.3 million in real estate loans and received proceeds from our real estate loans of $20.3 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $242.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, down from $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included $449.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes and other debt and $7.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The uses primarily included (i) aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations of $16.1 million, (ii) $160.6 million of cash dividend payments, (iii) payments of deferred financing costs of $4.9 million associated with the issuance of Senior Notes and (iv) net change in borrowings on the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility of $32.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included (i) $600.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, (ii) $102.0 million from the issuance of common stock, (iii) $50.2 million from net borrowings under our previous secured revolving credit facility and (iv) $6.8 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options. The uses primarily included (i) an aggregate principal payment of $212.6 million on the CMBS loan to fulfill this debt obligation, (ii) aggregate principal payments on other mortgage obligations of $19.4 million, (iii) $125.8 million of cash dividend payments and (iv) a cash payment for the Swap break of $2.3 million. 49 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in the future periods. Total Less than 1year 1 3 years (4) 3 5 years (5) More than 5 (6)years (in thousands) Long term debt obligations (1)(2) $ 3,387,525 $ 281,950 $ 700,230 $ 749,937 $ 1,655,408 Obligations under interest rate swap (2) 429 224 205 Acquisition commitments (3) 27,724 27,724 Operating lease obligations 1,934 692 891 351 Total $ 3,436,086 $ 329,064 $ 701,326 $ 750,288 $ 1,655,408 (1) Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest. (2) Interest on variable rate debt and obligations under the Swap were based on forward rates obtained as of December 31, 2006. (3) Includes commitments for the purchase of three seniors housing and other properties. One of these properties was acquired in an all cash transaction in January 2007 and the remaining two properties, which are part of the Senior Care acquisition, are tentatively scheduled to close in the first half of 2007. (4) Includes outstanding principal amounts of $174.2 million of the 2009 Senior Notes and $57.0 million of the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2006, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our third party lease obligations was approximately $18.6 million and that we have no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third party leases.
