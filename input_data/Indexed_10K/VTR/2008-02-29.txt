ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Key transactions that we completed in 2007; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; Our liquidity and capital resources; and Our funds from operations. Key Transactions in 2007 During 2007, we completed the following key transactions: We completed the acquisition of all of the assets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (Sunrise REIT) for aggregate consideration of approximately $2.0 billion. As a result, we acquired a 100% interest in 18 seniors housing communities and a 75% to 85% interest in 59 additional seniors housing communities located in 19 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. In addition, we assumed all rights and obligations of Sunrise REIT under two fixed price acquisition agreements with Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Sunrise) and subsequently acquired an 80% interest in two additional seniors housing communities located in Staten Island, New York and Vaughan, Ontario. We issued and sold 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement and received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to redeem and repay the majority of our acquisition facility drawn to acquire the Sunrise REIT assets. We purchased eight medical office buildings (MOBs) during 2007 for approximately $150.4 million, seven of which are owned through joint ventures with three different partners that provide management and leasing services for the properties. We now have MOB investments totaling over one million square feet. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) renewed, through April 30, 2013, its leases covering all 64 healthcare assets owned by us whose base term would have expired on April 30, 2008. We sold 21 skilled nursing facilities and one hospital to Kindred for $175.0 million in net cash proceeds. We entered into a Cdn $90.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Canadian credit facility) that bears interest at a fluctuating Bankers Acceptance rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage, which was 0.75% as of December 31, 2007. In January 2008, we increased the borrowing capacity under this facility to Cdn $105.0 million. 44 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority interests. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles Investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We estimate fair values of the components of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts, management agreements and related customer relationships. Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place tenant leases, above and or below market leases, other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations, as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue, as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is 45 Table of Contents amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant. We amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. The fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings. Discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition. Any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flows and sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. We did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Loans and Other Amounts Receivable from Third Parties We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility level financial and operations reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the borrowing or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the applicable borrower or tenant and any guarantor and (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements with Kindred (the Kindred Master Leases), but including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, which include Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, Brookdale Senior Living), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight 46 Table of Contents line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services are provided. Move in fees, which are included in resident fees and services, are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days notice. Gain on Sale of Assets We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Federal Income Tax Since we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), prior to the second quarter of 2007 we made no provision for federal income tax purposes and we will continue to make no provision for REIT income and expense. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, income tax expense or benefit is now being recorded with respect to certain entities which are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return. FIN 48 describes when and in what amount an uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and provides 47 Table of Contents guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. We adopted SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. The statement also requires that acquisition related transaction costs be expensed as incurred and acquired research and development value be capitalized. In addition, acquisition related restructuring costs are to be capitalized only if they meet certain criteria. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. SFAS No. 160 requires the classification of noncontrolling interests (formerly, minority interests) as a component of consolidated equity. In addition, net income will include the total income of all consolidated subsidiaries with the attribution of earnings and other comprehensive income between controlling and noncontrolling interests reported as a separate disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 160 also addresses accounting and reporting for a change in control of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 will be effective for us beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. This statement is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 48 Table of Contents Results of Operations The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute dollar and percentage changes in those results from year to year (dollars in thousands). Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2007 2006 $ % Revenues: Rental income $ 483,985 $ 405,952 $ 78,033 19.2 % Resident fees and services 282,226 282,226 nm Interest income from loans receivable 2,586 7,014 (4,428 ) (63.1 ) Interest and other income 2,994 2,886 108 3.7 Total revenues 771,791 415,852 355,939 85.6 Expenses: Interest 204,218 136,544 67,674 49.6 Depreciation and amortization 234,061 117,172 116,889 99.8 Property level operating expenses 198,125 3,171 194,954 nm General, administrative and professional fees (including non cash stock based compensation expense of $7,493 and $3,046 for the years ended 2007 and 2006, respectively) 36,425 26,136 10,289 39.4 (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt (88 ) 1,273 (1,361 ) nm Rent reset costs 7,361 (7,361 ) nm Reversal of contingent liability (1,769 ) 1,769 nm Foreign currency gain (24,280 ) (24,280 ) nm Merger related expenses 2,979 2,979 nm Total expenses 651,440 289,888 361,552 &gt; 100 Income before income taxes, minority interest and discontinued operations 120,351 125,964 (5,613 ) (4.5 ) Income tax benefit 28,042 28,042 nm Income before minority interest and discontinued operations 148,393 125,964 22,429 17.8 Minority interest, net of tax 1,698 1,698 nm Income from continuing operations 146,695 125,964 20,731 16.5 Discontinued operations 135,623 5,466 130,157 nm Net income 282,318 131,430 150,888 &gt; 100 Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs 5,199 5,199 nm Net income applicable to common shares $ 277,119 $ 131,430 $ 145,689 &gt; 100 % nm not meaningful Revenues The increase in our 2007 rental income, excluding rental income allocated to discontinued operations, primarily reflects (i) $26.4 million of additional rent resulting from the annual escalator in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2007 and the Kindred rent reset that was effective July 19, 2006, (ii) $7.6 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2007 (excluding the Sunrise REIT properties), (iii) $41.1 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2007 of properties acquired during 2006, and various other escalations in the rent paid on our existing properties. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents Resident fees and services are a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and are attributed to the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These amounts consist of all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise, including rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, decreased $4.4 million in 2007 primarily due to the repayment of a bridge loan made in 2006 to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties. The bridge loan bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% and was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care acquisition in November 2006. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan during 2006. Additionally, three of the six first mortgage loans we issued during 2005 were repaid in May 2007, representing a decrease in interest income from loans receivable of approximately $0.8 million. Expenses Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $2.1 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $65.2 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily due to $71.8 million of additional interest from higher loan balances as a result of our 2007 acquisition and loan activity, partially offset by a $9.2 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates. In 2007, we also recognized a $2.6 million expense for upfront fees on bridge financing related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Interest expense includes $5.5 million and $3.3 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007, from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to depreciation relating to the properties acquired during 2007 and 2006. Additionally, we incurred amortization expense of approximately $56.1 million related to in place lease intangibles from the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Property level operating expenses increased primarily due to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Property level operating expenses include all expenses related to our medical office building operations and all amounts incurred for the operations of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise for the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007, such as labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other property operating costs. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is due primarily to increased stock based compensation and increases in other general and administrative items resulting from our enterprise growth. In connection with the rent reset process under the Kindred Master Leases, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses. No similar costs were incurred during 2007. During 2006, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit. No similar activity occurred during 2007. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2007 represents the purchase of $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7 1/8% senior notes due 2015 in an open market transaction for a discount. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2006 represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our previous secured revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2006. 50 Table of Contents The foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily relates to the Canadian call option contracts that we entered into in conjunction with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. No similar contracts were in place for the comparable 2006 period. Merger related expenses were incurred in connection with the Sunrise REIT acquisition and include incremental costs directly related to the acquisition and expenses relating to our lawsuit against HCP, Inc. Income tax benefit represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Minority interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from the Sunrise REIT properties based on its ownership percentage in 61 of our seniors housing communities. Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs relate to the issuance of 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, all of which were redeemed in May 2007 using the proceeds from the sale of our common stock. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 51 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The increase in discontinued operations is due to the $3.5 million lease termination fee and the $129.5 million gain on sale of real estate assets recognized in the second quarter of 2007 resulting primarily from the sale of 22 properties to Kindred. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

The increase in our 2006 rental income, including rental income allocated to discontinued operations, reflects the recognition of (i) $11.3 million in additional rent relating to the properties acquired during 2006 ($7.0 million relates to the Senior Care acquisition), (ii) $58.9 million in additional rent relating to the full year effect in 2006 of properties acquired during 2005 ($46.4 million relates to the Provident Senior Living Trust acquisition), (see Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), (iii) $15 million of rental income resulting from the rent reset under the Kindred Master Leases, (iv) a $6.8 million increase in rent from Kindred resulting from the 3.5% annual escalator under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2006 (prior to the rent reset) and (v) $1.7 million of additional rental income resulting from rent escalations on various other properties. 52 Table of Contents Interest income from loans receivable, which includes amortization of deferred fees, increased $2.0 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a bridge loan issued to affiliates of the seller of the Senior Care properties, which bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% during the time the loan remained outstanding. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan, which was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care transaction in November 2006. This was partially offset by a net decrease of $1.7 million from interest income in connection with a $17.0 million mezzanine loan made to Trans Healthcare, Inc. in 2002, as this loan was repaid in full in March 2006. See Note 8 Loans Receivable of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Expenses Interest expense includes $3.3 million and $3.9 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $4.5 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $34.9 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily due to $40.7 million of additional interest expense due to increased debt to fund acquisitions made during 2006, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease from lower effective interest rates. Our effective interest rate decreased to 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, from 7.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the properties acquired during 2006 and 2005. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is attributable primarily to the expensing of stock options as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, at the beginning of 2006. In April 2006, we refinanced our previous $300.0 million secured revolving credit facility and entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, resulting in a loss from extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In December 2005, we paid off our commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) loan and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In connection with the Kindred rent reset process, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses. During 2006, we were notified by the IRS that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As a result of anticipated lower variable rate debt balances due to the payoff of our CMBS loan in December 2005, we entered into an agreement with the counterparty to our interest rate swap to reduce the notional amount of the swap to $100.0 million, from $330.0 million, for its remaining term in exchange for a payment to the counterparty of approximately $2.3 million. In addition, we recognized $3.3 million of a previously deferred gain recorded in connection with our 1999 transaction to shorten the maturity of a separate interest rate swap. During 2005, we settled our previously disclosed litigation against Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and received net proceeds of $15.9 million, after payment of expenses in connection with the settlement. See Note 15 Litigation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. With $2.0 million of the net proceeds received from the litigation settlement, we established and funded the Ventas Charitable Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation) in 2005. The Foundation is used to support charitable and philanthropic causes important to our employees and to the communities in which we operate. 53 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is a result of the sale of one property in 2005 for $9.9 million in net cash proceeds and a recognized net gain on the sale of $5.1 million. In addition, the tenant paid us lease termination fees of approximately $0.2 million. Discontinued operations in 2005 includes the net income of 23 properties sold, whereas discontinued operations in 2006 includes the net income from 22 properties sold. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Funds from Operations Our funds from operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2007 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Net income applicable to common shares $ 277,119 $ 131,430 $ 130,583 $ 120,900 $ 162,753 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization 232,952 115,788 84,877 45,943 36,681 Real estate depreciation related to minority interest (3,749 ) Loss on real estate disposals 175 Discontinued operations: Gain on sale of real estate assets (129,478 ) (5,114 ) (19,428 ) (51,781 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 812 2,450 2,682 2,907 4,978 FFO applicable to common shares 377,656 249,668 213,203 150,322 152,631 Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs 5,199 FFO $ 382,855 $ 249,668 $ 213,203 $ 150,322 $ 152,631 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily 54 Table of Contents interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk We receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. We also earn revenue from our senior living operations and our real estate loan investments. Our obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in LIBOR and Bankers Acceptance, respectively. The general fixed nature of our assets subject to long term triple net leases and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates were to rise significantly, our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations. In order to mitigate this risk, in September 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the original notional amount of $450.0 million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2008 (the Swap). The Swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of 5.385% and receive LIBOR from the counterparty. In December 2003, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the sale of ten properties, we reduced the notional amount of the Swap for the period from December 11, 2003 through June 29, 2006 from $450.0 million to $330.0 million. In December 2005, due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the payoff of our CMBS loan, we further reduced the notional amount of the Swap to $100.0 million for the remaining term of the Swap. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. There are no collateral requirements under the Swap. As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of the Swap was $100.0 million, which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008. To highlight the sensitivity of the Swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2007 and 2006: As of December 31, 2007 2006 Swap Fixed RateDebt Swap Fixed RateDebt (In thousands) Notional amount $ 100,000 N/A $ 100,000 N/A Gross book value N/A $ (2,879,907 ) N/A $ (2,052,293 ) Fair value (1) (503 ) (3,002,090 ) (429 ) (2,190,949 ) Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (1) 100 BPS (910 ) (3,134,816 ) (1,725 ) (2,301,226 ) +100 BPS (97 ) (2,877,929 ) 830 (2,088,514 ) (1) The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the assumption of approximately $831.9 million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2007 and overall changes in interest rates. N/A Not applicable. We paid $0.2 million under the Swap during the year ended December 31, 2007. Assuming that interest rates do not change, we estimate that we will pay $0.9 million on the Swap during the year ending December 31, 2008. 55 Table of Contents We had approximately $467.8 million and $284.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2006 is primarily attributable to additional net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility of $92.3 million and $89.7 million, respectively, and the assumption of additional variable debt from the properties managed by Sunrise totaling $121.4 million as of December 31, 2007, offset by the repayment of $114.8 million in variable mortgage debt in January 2007 assumed as part of the Senior Care acquisition. The Swap currently effectively hedges $100.0 million of our outstanding variable rate debt. Any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of $100.0 million are subject to interest rate changes. However, pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $98.1 million as of December 31, 2007, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2007, interest expense for 2008 would increase by approximately $2.7 million, or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us. We initially acquired eleven seniors housing communities in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia as part of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. In addition, we acquired for a fixed price another newly developed community in Canada in December 2007. As a result, we are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. As we increase our international presence through investments in, and or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and or healthcare related assets outside the United States, we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. We may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies. Our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes. Credit Risk As a result of our spin off of Kindred in May 1998 and the Provident acquisition in June 2005, we have a significant concentration of credit risk with Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Kindred accounted for $240.6 million, or 30.8% of our total revenues, and $220.9 million, or 51.6% of our total revenues, respectively, and Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $122.8 million, or 15.7% of our total revenues, and $122.7 million, or 28.6% of our total revenues, respectively. Accordingly, the financial condition of Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We are dependent on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living; either of Kindreds or Brookdale Senior Livings inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and 56 Table of Contents information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from a bridge loan, preferred equity issuance, dispositions, common stock offering, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility. We anticipate that cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, dividends to stockholders and debt amortization. Capital requirements for acquisitions, however, may require funding from borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. The $28.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2007 consists primarily of cash related to our seniors housing communities that is deposited and held in property level accounts. Funds maintained in the property level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property level expenses and certain capital expenditures. Our ownership share of property level cash in excess of stipulated amounts set forth in the Sunrise management agreements is currently being distributed to us monthly. We intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, assumption of indebtedness, disposition of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. As of December 31, 2007, we had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $54.1 million and unused credit availability of $446.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility and Cdn $0.9 million under the Canadian credit facility. Revolving Credit Facilities Our unsecured revolving credit facility borrowing capacity is $600.0 million. Generally, borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating LIBOR based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 0.75% at December 31, 2007. On July 27, 2007, we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility to include a $150.0 million accordion feature that permits us to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of $750.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Pricing under the unsecured revolving credit facility did not change and we did not record any material expenses or charges in connection with the amendment. On August 24, 2007, we entered into the Canadian credit facility. Generally, borrowings outstanding under the Canadian credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating Bankers Acceptance rate per annum plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. As of December 31, 2007, the applicable percentage was 0.75%. On January 24, 2008, we amended the Canadian credit facility to expand our borrowing capacity to a total of Cdn $105.0 million. We also extended the original maturity date from February 24, 2008 to May 24, 2008. We may further extend the maturity date for an additional three months subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Convertible Senior Notes In December 2006, we completed the offering of $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 7/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated 57 Table of Contents maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at an initial conversion rate of 22.1867 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately $45.07 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. As of December 31, 2007, the adjusted conversion rate was 22.3615 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a conversion price of approximately $44.72 per share). To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, our earnings per share will be diluted. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the Convertible Notes offering, we filed a registration statement covering resales by the holders of shares of our common stock, if any, issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales. As of December 31, 2007, $230.0 million principal amount of Convertible Notes were outstanding. Certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Convertible Notes. Senior Notes Offerings In September 2006, we completed the offering of $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Senior Notes) of Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the Issuers) at a 5/8% discount to par value. In December 2005, we completed the offering of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Senior Notes) of the Issuers at a 1/2% discount to par value. In June 2005, we completed the offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2010 (the 2010 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, and $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Senior Notes) of the Issuers. In June 2005, we also completed the offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, which was in addition to the $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Senior Notes originally issued in October 2004. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes was issued at a 1% discount to par value. The additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount and the original $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Senior Notes are governed by the same indenture. On August 3, 2007, we purchased $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 2015 Senior Notes in an open market transaction. Pursuant to registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes offerings, on October 28, 2005, we completed offers to exchange the 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and additional 2014 Senior Notes with new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2010 Senior Notes, 2015 Senior Notes and 2014 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offers. Pursuant to the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the 2016 Senior Notes offerings, on April 7, 2006, we completed an offer to exchange the 2016 Senior Notes with a new series of notes that are registered under the Securities Act and are otherwise substantially identical to the original 2016 Senior Notes, except that certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and liquidated damages do not apply to the new notes. We did not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer. As of December 31, 2007, $174.2 million principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 (the 2009 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, $175.0 million principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes, $191.8 million principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 2012 Senior Notes) of the Issuers, $175.0 million principal amount 58 Table of Contents of 2014 Senior Notes, $170.0 million principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million principal amount of 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million principal amount of the 2017 Senior Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) were outstanding. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes. The agreements governing our revolving credit facilities, the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). We declared dividends greater than 100% of estimated taxable income for 2007 and intend to pay a dividend greater than 100% of taxable income for 2008. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures to maintain and improve our triple net leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these triple net leased properties. After the terms of the triple net leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the triple net leases, we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of these triple net leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our senior living communities managed by Sunrise and our MOBs, we believe that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes. Equity Offerings In May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we used along with the proceeds of the disposition of the Kindred assets (see Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Senior Preferred Stock and to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan used to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Our automatic universal shelf registration statement, filed with the Commission in April 2006, relates to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement, under which approximately $500.0 million of securities remained available for offering. 59 Table of Contents In July 2005, we completed the sale of 3,247,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our previous shelf registration statement. We received $97.0 million in net proceeds from the sale, which we used to repay indebtedness under our previous secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions. In February 2008, we completed the sale of 4,485,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our current shelf registration statement. We received $191.9 million in net proceeds, before expenses but after the underwriting discount, from the sale, which we used in part to repay indebtedness and will use for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions, if any. Other During 2007 and 2006, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Sunrise REIT and Senior Care acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Outstanding facility level mortgage debt was approximately $1.6 billion and $734.0 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We received proceeds on the exercises of stock options in the amounts of $9.8 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future proceeds on the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have decreased to 950,395 as of December 31, 2007, from 1,156,051 as of December 31, 2006. We generated net proceeds from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan of $1.1 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In March 2005, we began offering a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. We have outstanding loans made at various times from 1998 through 2002 to certain current and former executive officers in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.1 million as of December 31, 2007, down from $2.5 million at December 31, 2006. The loans are payable over ten years beginning, in each case, on the date such loan was made. See Note 17 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $399.8 million and $238.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase is due to FFO that was higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of our real estate acquisitions (primarily the Sunrise REIT acquisition), rent escalations in our leases with tenants and additional rent resulting from the rent reset under the Kindred Master Leases, and changes in operating assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion and $482.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These activities consisted primarily of our investments in real estate, offset by proceeds from our mortgage loans, the sale of securities and the sale of assets during the applicable periods. The increase from 2006 is due primarily to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. 60 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $805.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Proceeds primarily consisted of $1.2 billion in bridge financing, $1.05 billion from the issuance of common stock, $176.6 million of net borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and our Canadian credit facility and $53.8 million from the issuance of other debt. The uses primarily included (i) $1.2 billion for repayment of the bridge financing, (ii) $286.2 million of cash dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders and (iii) $184.6 million of aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $242.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, down from $389.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The proceeds included $449.0 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, Convertible Notes and other debt and $7.5 million from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and from our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. The uses primarily included (i) aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations of $16.1 million, (ii) $160.6 million of cash dividend payments, (iii) payments of deferred financing costs of $4.9 million associated with the issuance of Senior Notes and (iv) net change in borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and our previous secured revolving credit facility of $32.2 million. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2007. Total Less than 1year 1 3 years (4) 3 5 years (5) More than 5years (6) (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (1)(2) $ 4,479,754 $ 399,419 $ 1,181,314 $ 1,083,712 $ 1,815,309 Obligations under interest rate swap (2) 567 567 Acquisition commitments (3) 34,150 34,150 Operating and ground lease obligations 90,066 1,694 2,938 2,202 83,232 Total $ 4,604,537 $ 435,830 $ 1,184,252 $ 1,085,914 $ 1,898,541 (1) Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest. (2) Interest on variable rate debt and obligations under our interest rate swap were based on forward rates obtained as of December 31, 2007. (3) Includes commitments for the purchase of one seniors housing community that closed in January 2008 and one surgery center/MOB that is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2008. (4) Includes outstanding principal amounts of $174.2 million of the 2009 Senior Notes and $149.3 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in 2009 (with an option to extend for one year subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions). (5) Includes outstanding principal amounts of $175.0 million of the 2010 Senior Notes and $230.0 million of the Convertible Notes. (6) Includes outstanding principal amounts of $191.8 million of the 2012 Senior Notes, $175.0 million of the 2014 Senior Notes, $170.0 million of the 2015 Senior Notes, $200.0 million of the 2016 Senior Notes and $225.0 million of the 2017 Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2007, we had $9.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits under the provisions of FIN 48 that have been excluded from the table above, as we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authority. In connection with the Kindred spin off, we assigned our former third party lease obligations and third party guarantee agreements to Kindred. As of December 31, 2007, we believe that the aggregate exposure under our 61 Table of Contents third party lease obligations was approximately $16.0 million and that we have no material exposure under the third party guarantee agreements. Kindred has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all claims against us arising out of the third party leases, and we do not expect to incur any liability under those leases. However, we cannot assure you that Kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy, or that it will continue to honor its obligations under the indemnity agreement relating to the third party leases.
