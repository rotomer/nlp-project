ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Our corporate and operating environment; 2008 highlights and other recent developments; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; Asset and liability management; Our liquidity and capital resources; Our cash flows; and Contractual obligations. Corporate and Operating Environment We are a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2008, this portfolio consisted of 513 assets: 248 seniors housing communities, 192 skilled nursing facilities, 41 hospitals and 32 medical office buildings (MOBs) and other properties in 43 states and two Canadian provinces. With the exception of 79 of our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Sunrise) pursuant to long term management agreements and the majority of our MOBs, we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. We also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies as of December 31, 2008. Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers. We operate through two reportable business segments: triple net leased properties and senior living operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had a 100% ownership interest in 444 of our properties. Of the remaining 69 properties, we had a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 seniors housing communities, with the minority interest in those communities being owned by Sunrise, and we had joint venture ownership interests in eight MOBs, ranging from 50% to 99.7%. Our joint venture partners also typically provide management and leasing services for these MOBs. Our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives: (1) portfolio diversification; (2) stable earnings and growth; and (3) maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. While current conditions in the capital markets persist, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity will be our primary focus. Access to external capital is an important component of the success of our strategy. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2008, only 17.4% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters 46 Table of Contents to the extent it is reasonable to do so. As of December 31, 2008, we had credit ratings of BBB (stable) from Standard & Poors Ratings Services, BBB (positive) from Fitch Ratings and Ba1 (stable) from Moodys Investors Service on our senior unsecured debt securities. Access to capital markets impacts our ability to repay existing indebtedness as it matures and to make future investments. Our cost of and ability to access capital depend on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock. 2008 Highlights and Other Recent Developments Liquidity and Balance Sheet We amended and extended our unsecured revolving credit facility (the U.S. credit facility) and entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility (the Canadian credit facility) to expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to $850.0 million and set the maturity date at April 26, 2010. Under the Canadian credit facility, we may borrow up to $150.0 million or the equivalent in Canadian dollars. The U.S. credit facility includes a $150.0 million accordion feature that permits us to further expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, the Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 0.75% at December 31, 2008. We completed the sale of 9,236,083 shares of our common stock in two underwritten public offerings pursuant to our existing universal shelf registration statement and received aggregate proceeds of $409.0 million from the sales. We purchased $124.4 million principal amount of our 8 3/4% senior notes due 2009 and $52.0 million principal amount of our 6 3/4% senior notes due 2010 in open market transactions and recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million. We benefited in 2008 from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability in the amount of $23.3 million. We no longer expected to make any payments relating to that contingent liability and, therefore, the liability was removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheet and included in our income for the year. We raised $126.7 million in ten year 6.6% first mortgage financing on eight seniors housing communities. Our pro rata share of the proceeds was $107.2 million. Investments We purchased $112.5 million principal amount of first mortgage debt issued by a national provider of healthcare services, primarily skilled nursing care. We purchased the debt at a discount for $98.8 million, resulting in an effective interest rate to maturity of LIBOR plus 533 basis points. Interest on the loan is payable monthly at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and the loan matures in 2012, subject to a one year extension, at the borrowers option, subject to certain conditions. We purchased a 47 unit seniors housing community located in Texas for $5.1 million and leased it to an affiliate of Capital Senior Living Corporation. We purchased three MOBs for approximately $66.8 million, increasing our total MOB investments to over 1.5 million square feet. We own one of these MOBs through a joint venture with a partner that provides management and leasing services for the property. 47 Table of Contents We entered into an agreement giving us the exclusive right, as part of a joint venture, to develop up to ten identified MOBs on hospital campuses in eight states. This joint venture is with a nationally recognized private developer of MOBs and healthcare facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had initially invested approximately $8.7 million in two MOBs that were both under development. These developments have $32.6 million of committed construction loans. We purchased $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of three fixed rate and one variable rate unsecured corporate debt instruments issued by national healthcare companies, primarily at discounts for a total of $63.7 million. These debt investments mature between October 2012 and April 2016, and the effective interest rate for each investment is approximately 9%. Dispositions We sold seven healthcare assets in the second quarter for $69.1 million and recognized a gain from the sale of $25.9 million. In the fourth quarter, we sold five seniors housing communities to the existing tenant for $62.5 million. We realized a gain from the sale of $21.5 million, $8.3 million of which was deferred and will be recognized over the next three years. In January 2009, we sold four seniors housing assets for $58.7 million and expect to recognize a gain from the sale of approximately $11 million in the first quarter of 2009. In February 2009, we sold a hospital and a MOB for $35 million in an all cash transaction and expect to recognize a gain from the sale of $18 million in the first quarter of 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting treatment would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, please see Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority interests. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles Investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method. The cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and 48 Table of Contents liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We estimate fair values of the components of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts, management agreements and related customer relationships. Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place tenant leases, above and or below market leases, other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations, as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue, as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis, and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset or internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) above and or below market leases, if any, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant. We amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. The fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings. Discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition. Any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Marketable Debt and Equity Securities We record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities are classified as a 49 Table of Contents component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are recorded at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest income, including discount or premium amortization, on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold, which are based on the specific identification method, are reported in income from loans and investments on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Loans Receivable Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances. Net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs. Net deferred origination fees and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the loan or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor, (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant and (v) current economic conditions. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, excluding our master lease agreements with Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) (the Kindred Master Leases), but including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Brookdale Senior Living), provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment. Certain of our other leases, including the Kindred Master Leases, provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met, rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services are provided. Move in fees, which are a component of resident fees and services, are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days notice. Gain on Sale of Assets We recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser. Payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the 50 Table of Contents sale to earn the profit, we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied. Gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Federal Income Tax Since we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), prior to our acquisition of the assets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (Sunrise REIT) in April 2007 we made no provision for federal income tax purposes, and we will continue to make no provision for REIT income and expense. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return. FIN 48 describes when and in what amount an uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and provides guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy). Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are 51 Table of Contents observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP No. 157 2), which delays the adoption date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities. We adopted FSP No. 157 2 on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2009, we adopted SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations; SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51; and Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position No. APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (APB 14 1). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. The statement also requires that acquisition related transaction costs be expensed as incurred, that acquired research and development value be capitalized, and that acquisition related restructuring costs be capitalized only if they meet certain criteria. SFAS No. 141(R) did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements at the time of adoption. SFAS No. 160 changes the reporting for minority interests, which must now be characterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of consolidated equity. The calculation of income and earnings per share continues to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent and is characterized as net income from controlling interests. As the ownership of a subsidiary increases or decreases, SFAS No. 160 requires that any difference between the consideration paid and the adjustment to the noncontrolling interest balance be recorded as a component of equity in additional paid in capital, so long as we maintain a controlling ownership interest. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 also did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents APB 14 1 specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. The following table summarizes the impact that the adoption of APB 14 1 is expected to have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Rental income included in discontinued operations was $14.0 million and $24.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Revenues related to our triple net leased properties segment are received directly from the tenant operator of the property based on the terms of the lease and are generally fixed amounts, with annual escalators (subject to certain limitations). Therefore, while occupancy information is relevant to the operations of the tenant, our revenues and financial results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy levels or profits at the triple net leased properties. Looking forward, some of our lease escalators are tied to annual increases in the Consumer Price Index, which recently have trended negatively, and we are likely to see less growth in our rental income from these escalators as long as deflationary conditions continue. The increase in resident fees and services during 2008 can be attributed primarily to the fact that we did not acquire the Sunrise REIT properties until late April 2007. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These amounts consist of all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise, including rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Average occupancy rates related to these properties were as follows: Occupancy Number ofCommunities (1) For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (2) Stabilized Communities 77 72 91 % 93 % Lease Up Communities 2 7 55 % 57 % Total 79 79 89 % 90 % Occupancy Number ofCommunities (1) For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 (2) Same Store Stabilized Communities 72 72 91 % 93 % Same Store Lease Up Communities 7 7 70 % 57 % Total 79 79 89 % 90 % (1) Includes those communities which were in the respective portfolios as of December 31; five communities were moved from lease up to stabilized in 2008. (2) Occupancy for the period from May 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 as properties were not acquired until late April 2007. Income from loans and investments increased during 2008 primarily due to interest earned on a $50.0 million marketable debt security purchased in early April 2008 and a first mortgage debt investment of $98.8 million made in late 2008, partially offset by a gain on the sale of marketable equity securities recognized in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in our interest and other income during 2008 is primarily attributable to the resolution in September 2008 of a legal dispute. Expenses Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $6.3 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $3.1 million in 2008 over 2007, primarily due to $13.8 million of additional interest from higher loan balances as a result of our 2008 acquisition and loan activity, partially offset by a $11.6 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates and a $2.6 million loss due to early repayment of bridge 55 Table of Contents financing in 2007 related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Interest expense includes $7.1 million and $5.5 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation relating to the properties acquired during 2008 and 2007, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of approximately $26.9 million related to in place lease intangibles primarily related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. These in place lease intangibles were fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Property level operating expenses increased primarily due to the Sunrise REIT acquisition, a $6.0 million provision for loan losses recorded in the third quarter of 2008, and a $4.0 million increase related to the growth of our MOB business. Our results for 2007 reflect only eight months of the Sunrise related expenses due to the late April 2007 acquisition date. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is a result of our enterprise growth, an increase in non cash stock based compensation and dead deal costs. The foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily relates to the Canadian call option contracts we entered into in conjunction with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. No similar contracts were in place for the comparable 2008 period. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2008 primarily represents the purchase of $124.4 million principal amount of our 8 3/4% senior notes due 2009 and $52.0 million principal amount of our 6 3/4% senior notes due 2010 in open market transactions for a discount. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2007 represents the purchase of $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7 1/8% senior notes due 2015 in an open market transaction for a discount. Merger related expenses for 2008 and 2007 primarily consisted of expenses relating to our litigation with HCP, Inc. arising out of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Merger related expenses for 2007 also included incremental costs directly related to the acquisition. Other We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability to be utilized for any built in gains tax related to the disposition of certain assets owned or deemed to be owned by us prior to our REIT election in 1999. The ten year period in which these assets were subject to built in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008. Because we had no pending or planned dispositions of these assets through December 31, 2008, we did not expect to pay any amounts related to this contingent liability. Therefore, this contingent liability was no longer required, and $23.3 million was reversed into income during the third quarter of 2008. Income tax benefit represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Minority interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from its ownership percentage in 61 of our seniors housing communities. Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs in 2007 related to the 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock that were issued to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, all of which we redeemed in 56 Table of Contents May 2007 using the proceeds from the sale of our common stock. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations The decrease in discontinued operations is primarily the result of a gain of $129.5 million recognized in 2007 from the sale of 22 assets compared to a gain of $39.0 million recognized in 2008 from the sale of twelve assets.

See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Rental income included in discontinued operations was $24.7 million and $30.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Resident fees and services are a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and are attributed to the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These amounts consist of all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise, including rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Income from loans and investments, which includes amortization of deferred fees, decreased $4.4 million in 2007 primarily due to the repayment of a bridge loan we made in 2006 to affiliates of the seller of 64 properties we currently lease to Senior Care, Inc. (Senior Care). The bridge loan bore interest at a rate of approximately 10.4% and was repaid upon consummation of the Senior Care acquisition in November 2006. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We recognized approximately $3.4 million of interest income from this loan during 2006. Additionally, three of the six first mortgage loans we issued during 2005 were repaid in May 2007, representing a decrease in income from loans and investments of approximately $0.8 million. Expenses Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $10.6 million and $12.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $65.2 million in 2007 over 2006, primarily due to $71.8 million of additional interest from higher loan balances as a result of our 2007 acquisition and loan activity, partially offset by a $9.2 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates. In 2007, we also recognized a $2.6 million expense for upfront fees on bridge financing related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Interest expense includes $5.5 million and $3.3 million of amortized deferred financing costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007, from 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to depreciation relating to the properties acquired during 2007 and 2006. Additionally, we incurred amortization expense of approximately $56.1 million related to in place lease intangibles from the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Property level operating expenses increased primarily due to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Property level operating expenses include all expenses related to our MOB operations and all amounts incurred for the operations of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise for the period from April 26, 2007 through December 31, 2007, such as labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other property operating costs. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees is due primarily to increased stock based compensation and increases in other general and administrative items resulting from our enterprise growth. The foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily relates to the Canadian call option contracts we entered into in conjunction with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. No similar contracts were in place for the comparable 2006 period. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2007 represents the purchase of $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 7 1/8% senior notes due 2015 in an open market transaction for a discount. The loss on 58 Table of Contents extinguishment of debt in 2006 represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our previous secured revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2006. Merger related expenses in 2007 consisted of incremental costs directly related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition and expenses relating to our litigation with HCP, Inc. arising out of the acquisition. In connection with the rent reset process under the Kindred Master Leases, we incurred approximately $7.4 million of one time costs which we expensed during 2006. These costs included fees of the final appraisers and third party experts, consulting fees and legal fees and expenses. No similar costs were incurred during 2007. During 2006, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that it had completed its audit of our 2001 federal tax return with no additional tax being due. Accordingly, we reversed into income a previously recorded $1.8 million tax liability related to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this audit. No similar activity occurred during 2007. Income tax benefit represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Minority interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from the Sunrise REIT properties based on its ownership percentage in 61 of our seniors housing communities. Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs related to the 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock that were issued to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, all of which we redeemed in May 2007 using the proceeds from the sale of our common stock. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations The increase in discontinued operations is primarily due to the $129.5 million gain on sale of real estate assets recognized in the second quarter of 2007 resulting primarily from the sale of 22 properties to Kindred. See Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Funds from Operations Our funds from operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2008 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (In thousands) Net income applicable to common shares $ 226,288 $ 277,119 $ 131,430 $ 130,583 $ 120,900 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization 231,079 226,354 109,370 79,283 42,128 Real estate depreciation related to minority interest (6,251 ) (3,749 ) Loss on real estate disposals 175 Discontinued operations: Gain on sale of real estate assets (39,026 ) (129,478 ) (5,114 ) (19,428 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 3,952 7,410 8,868 8,276 6,722 FFO applicable to common shares 416,042 377,656 249,668 213,203 150,322 Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs 5,199 FFO $ 416,042 $ 382,855 $ 249,668 $ 213,203 $ 150,322 59 Table of Contents Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk Market risks relating to our financial instruments result primarily from changes in U.S. or Canadian LIBOR rates, the Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rates. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations and mortgage loans receivable. While interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our fixed rate debt obligations unless such instruments mature, or until such time that we would be required to refinance such debt, they will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. If interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures, or at such time we would be required to refinance such debt, our profitability could be adversely affected by the additional cost of borrowings. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time our debt matures or at the time of refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs. We continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of the current and future economic environment. 60 Table of Contents To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2008 and 2007: As of December 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Gross book value $ 2,592,730 $ 2,879,907 Fair value (1) 2,436,620 3,002,090 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (1) 100 BPS 2,538,334 3,134,816 +100 BPS 2,340,746 2,877,929 (1) The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to debt repayments and overall changes in interest rates. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 2007 Balance: Fixed rate $ 2,592,730 $ 2,879,907 Variable rate 546,410 467,769 Total $ 3,139,140 $ 3,347,676 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 82.6 % 86.0 % Variable rate 17.4 14.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.5 % 6.7 % Variable rate 2.3 % 5.5 % Total weighted average rate 5.8 % 6.5 % The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2007 is primarily attributable to additional net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and additional borrowings related to 2008 acquisitions. Pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $97.5 million as of December 31, 2008, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2008, interest expense for 2009 (inclusive of the $97.5 million) would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately $4.5 million, or $0.03 per common share on a diluted basis. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. In the past, we mitigated some interest rate risk through an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge against rising interest rates. However, the swap expired on June 30, 2008, and we do not currently have any interest rate swap agreements in effect, nor do we expect to enter into any additional interest rate swap agreements at this time. We may, however, engage in hedging strategies in the future, depending on managements analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies. We do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. 61 Table of Contents We are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our Canadian operations. Based on 2008 results, if the Canadian exchange rate were to increase or decrease by $0.10, our net income would decrease or increase, as applicable, by approximately $0.2 million per year. If we increase our international presence through investments in, and or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the United States, we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a Material Adverse Effect). We also have investments in marketable debt securities where we earn interest on a fixed and floating rate basis. These investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity. Interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair market value of these investments to change. As of December 31, 2008, the fair market value of our marketable debt securities was $51.6 million, with an original cost of $63.7 million. During 2008, we purchased $112.5 million principal amount of first mortgage debt issued by a national provider of healthcare services, primarily skilled nursing care. We purchased the debt at a discount for $98.8 million, resulting in an effective interest rate to maturity of LIBOR plus 533 basis points. Interest on the loan is payable monthly at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and the loan matures in January 2012, subject to a one year extension, at the borrowers option, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2008, we held a receivable for three outstanding first mortgage loans (the Sunwest Loans) in the aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million. During 2008, we recorded a provision for loan losses on the Sunwest Loans of $6.0 million as a result of certain defaults by the borrower. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of our loans receivable was $111.9 million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans. See Note 8 Loans Receivable and Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Credit Risk We receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the Consumer Price Index, with caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenue from residents and tenants at our operating assets. Historically, most of our revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) were derived from assets subject to long term triple net leases. Currently, 22.3% of our EBITDA is derived from non triple net leases (our senior living operations and MOBs) where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, Kindred accounted for $241.2 million, or 25.5%, of our total revenues and 38.0% of our total NOI (net operating income) (including amounts in discontinued operations), and $240.6 million, or 30.8%, of our total revenues and 41.5% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $121.5 million, or 12.8%, of our total revenues and 19.2% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), and $122.8 million, or 15.7%, of our total revenues and 21.2% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), respectively. This concentration of rental revenues creates 62 Table of Contents credit risk. As a result, Kindreds and Brookdale Senior Livings financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us has a significant impact on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities, which could also affect its ability to pay rent to us. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Any inability or unwillingness of Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 4 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Approximately 20.0% of our EBITDA and 45.4% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2008 were attributable to senior living operations managed by Sunrise. Approximately 36.2% of our total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2007 were attributable to senior living operations managed by Sunrise for the period from April 26, 2007 (the date of the Sunrise REIT acquisition) through December 31, 2007. We are party to management agreements with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to the management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee of 6% of resident fees and similar revenues, subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to NOI for a pool of properties. The minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is 5% of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties. We also pay incentive fees if a pool of properties exceeds aggregate performance targets relating to NOI; provided, however, that total management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 8% of resident fees and similar revenues. In 2008, we paid a 5.75% management fee for 71 properties and management fees of between 6% and 10.4% for eight properties. The management agreements also specify that we (or the joint venture to which we are party, as applicable) will reimburse Sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities. We may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by Sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in each case to Sunrises rights to cure deficiencies. Each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to Sunrise. In addition, if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted NOI level for a given period, then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such pool. This targeted NOI level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property, with such projection escalating annually. However, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. We own a 75% to 85% ownership interest in 61 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to joint venture agreements, with the minority interests in these joint ventures being owned by Sunrise. These joint ventures are each managed by a board of managers, which we control. As the controlling member, we have authority to make all decisions for our Sunrise joint ventures except for a limited set of major decisions, which generally include: (a) the merger or disposition of substantially all the assets of the joint venture; (b) the sale of 63 Table of Contents additional interests in the joint venture; (c) the dissolution of the joint venture; (d) the disposition of a senior housing community owned by the joint venture; and (e) the acquisition of any real property. We can generally transfer our interest in a Sunrise joint venture, without consent, to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors. Generally, Sunrise must obtain our prior consent for any direct or indirect transfer of its interest in a joint venture. With limited exceptions, profits and losses of the joint venture are allocated pro rata to each member. If either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period, the non defaulting member may (i) revoke the capital contribution funding notice, (ii) advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member, with all of the defaulting members subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full, or (iii) advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each members proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements. Many of our Sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting members proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non defaulting member pursuant to option (iii). The joint ventures are generally limited to incurring new or refinanced mortgage indebtedness in excess of 75% of the market value of its properties. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Adverse developments in Sunrises business and affairs or financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Lease Expirations As our triple net leases expire, we are exposed to the risks that our tenants may elect not to renew and, in such event, that we may be unable to reposition our properties on the same or better terms, if at all. The following table summarizes our triple net lease expirations scheduled to occur over the next ten years (dollars in thousands).

Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2008, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from our common stock offerings, issuance of mortgage debt, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, asset dispositions and cash flows from 64 Table of Contents operations. During the next twelve months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay $118.1 million of debt maturing; (iv) fund capital expenditures; (v) fund investments and or commitments; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. We believe that these needs will be satisfied by cash flows from operations, debt financings, proceeds from sales of assets and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. However, if these sources of capital are not available and or if we make acquisitions and investments, we may be required to obtain funding from additional borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. We expect to be able to extend, refinance, renew or replace a substantial portion of our unsecured revolving credit facilities prior to their maturity in April 2010, but we cannot give any assurances as to whether we will be able to extend, refinance, renew or replace any portion of our unsecured revolving credit facilities or as to the timing or terms of any such extension, refinancing, renewal or replacement. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure The recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis may limit our access to capital and have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2008, we had $176.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of investments in U.S. treasury money market funds and cash related to our seniors housing communities that is deposited and held in property level accounts. Funds maintained in the property level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property level expenses and certain capital expenditures. A portion of the cash maintained in these property level accounts is distributed to us monthly. At December 31, 2008, we also had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $55.9 million and unused credit availability of $546.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities Our unsecured revolving credit facilities mature in April 2010 and permit us to borrow up to an aggregate of $850.0 million. Of this amount, we may borrow up to $150.0 million or the equivalent in Canadian dollars under the Canadian credit facility. The U.S. credit facility includes a $150.0 million accordion feature that permits us to further expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. The applicable percentage was 0.75% at December 31, 2008. The agreements governing our unsecured revolving credit facilities subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc. (Lehman) is a named lender under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and has a $20 million funding commitment (approximately 2% of the aggregate borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities) to us. Lehman has defaulted on its obligations to fund our borrowing requests, and we are seeking an assignment of this portion of our unsecured revolving credit facilities, through Lehmans Chapter 11 proceeding, to a third party investor who we believe represents the economic interest in such obligation. We cannot give any assurances as to whether or when an assignment of Lehmans interest in our unsecured revolving credit facilities may occur. We also cannot give any assurances that the other lenders under our unsecured revolving credit facilities will continue to fund their respective portions of our borrowing requests. While we currently have no reason to believe that we will be unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities in the future, concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of borrowers specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease funding to borrowers. The economic downturn and credit crisis have resulted in the bankruptcy or merger of 65 Table of Contents many financial institutions, like Lehman, that could adversely impact our ability to draw on our unsecured revolving credit facilities. If we are unable to access our unsecured revolving credit facilities, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected. As of February 20, 2009, we had $410.6 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facilities due April 2010 and approximately $392.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, for a net amount of $18.3 million. Convertible Senior Notes As of December 31, 2008, we had $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 7/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 (the Convertible Notes) outstanding. The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity, in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at the current conversion rate of 22.6262 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a current conversion price of approximately $44.20 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price our earnings per share will be diluted. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with our initial offering of the Convertible Notes, we have filed a shelf registration statement covering resales by the holders of shares of our common stock, if any, issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We will not receive any proceeds in connection with any such resales. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes subjects us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Convertible Notes. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted APB 14 1, which requires us to separately account for the liability and equity component in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. See Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Senior Notes As of December 31, 2008, we had the following series of senior notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation, outstanding: $49.8 million principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Notes due 2009 (the 2009 Senior Notes); $123.0 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2010 (the 2010 Senior Notes); $191.8 million principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012 (the 2012 Senior Notes); $175.0 million principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 2014 Senior Notes); $170.0 million principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015 (the 2015 Senior Notes); $200.0 million principal amount of 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Senior Notes); and $225.0 million principal amount of the 6 3/4 % Senior Notes due 2017 (the 2017 Senior Notes). 66 Table of Contents During 2008, we purchased $124.4 million principal amount of our outstanding 2009 Senior Notes and $52.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 2010 Senior Notes in open market transactions. As a result of these purchases, we recorded a $2.5 million gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2008. In 2007, we purchased $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 2015 Senior Notes in an open market transaction. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of the outstanding Senior Notes for cash and or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The indentures governing the Senior Notes subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). Our quarterly dividends in 2008 aggregated $2.05 per share, which is greater than 100% of our 2008 estimated taxable income. We also intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of taxable income for 2009. On February 11, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.5125 per share, payable in cash on March 31, 2009 to holders of record on March 18, 2009. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Requirements for Qualification as a REIT Annual Distribution Requirements included in Part I, Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures to maintain and improve our triple net leased properties are generally the responsibility of our tenants. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these properties. After the terms of the triple net leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases, we anticipate funding any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our operating assets, including our communities that are managed by Sunrise and our MOBs, we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes. Our ability to borrow may also be limited by our lenders ability and willingness to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. 67 Table of Contents Equity Offerings In 2008, we sold 9,236,083 shares of our common stock in underwritten public offerings pursuant to our existing universal shelf registration statement. We received aggregate proceeds of $409.0 million from the sales, which we used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. In May 2007, we completed the sale of 26,910,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our existing universal shelf registration statement. We received $1.05 billion in net proceeds from the sale, which we used along with the proceeds from our disposition of certain Kindred assets (see Note 6 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Senior Preferred Stock and to repay our indebtedness under the senior interim loan used to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Our automatic universal shelf registration statement, filed with the Commission in April 2006, relates to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement will expire in April 2009 pursuant to the Commissions rules, and we intend to replace it with a new universal shelf registration statement upon expiration. Other During 2008 and 2007, we assumed facility level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions, including the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 5 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All facility level mortgage debt outstanding was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We received proceeds of $6.2 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options. Future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have increased to 1.4 million as of December 31, 2008, from 0.9 million as of December 31, 2007. We issued approximately 18,400 and 20,750 shares of common stock under our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, for net proceeds of $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We currently offer a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $364.2 million and $401.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2008 is attributable to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher FFO resulting from a full year of our senior living operations, accretive acquisitions and rent escalations from our triple net lease tenants. 68 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $136.3 million and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These activities consisted primarily of: (i) investments in real estate ($53.8 million and $1.3 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively); (ii) capital expenditures ($16.4 million and $8.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively); (iii) investments in loans receivable and marketable debt securities ($172.5 million in 2008); (iv) proceeds from mortgage loans ($0.1 million and $15.8 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively); (v) the sale of marketable equity securities ($7.8 million in 2007); and (vi) proceeds from real estate disposals ($104.2 million and $157.4 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively). Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $80.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and included $288.8 million of cash dividend payments to common stockholders and $416.9 million of aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations. The uses were partially offset by proceeds of $408.5 million from the issuance of common stock, $140.3 million related to the issuance of debt and $73.4 million of net borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $805.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and included proceeds of $1.2 billion in bridge financing, $1.05 billion from the issuance of common stock, $176.6 million of net borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and our previous Canadian credit facility and $53.8 million from the issuance of other debt. Uses consisted of (i) $1.2 billion for repayment of the bridge financing, (ii) $286.2 million of cash dividend payments to common and preferred stockholders and (iii) $184.6 million of aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2008. Total Less than1 year (4) 1 3 years (5) 3 5 years (6) More than5 years (7) (In thousands) Long term debt obligations (1) (2) $ 4,205,902 $ 361,750 $ 1,248,611 $ 902,735 $ 1,692,806 Acquisition commitments (3) 17,093 17,093 Operating and ground lease obligations 83,180 1,426 2,421 2,059 77,274 Total $ 4,306,175 $ 380,269 $ 1,251,032 $ 904,794 $ 1,770,080 (1) Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.
