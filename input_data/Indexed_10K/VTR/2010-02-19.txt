ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Our corporate and operating environment; 2009 highlights and other recent developments; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; Asset and liability management; Our liquidity and capital resources; Our cash flows; and Contractual obligations. Corporate and Operating Environment We are a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2009, this portfolio consisted of 505 assets: 244 seniors housing communities, 187 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals and 34 medical office buildings (MOBs) and other properties in 43 states and two Canadian provinces. With the exception of our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Sunrise) pursuant to long term management agreements and the majority of our MOBs, we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. We also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or properties as of December 31, 2009. Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers. We operate through two reportable business segments: triple net leased properties and senior living operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had a 100% ownership interest in 439 of our properties. We had 75% to 85% interests in 60 seniors housing communities owned in joint ventures with Sunrise, and we had controlling interests in six MOBs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide management and leasing services for the properties. Our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives: (1) portfolio diversification; (2) stable earnings and growth; and (3) maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. Access to external capital is an important component of the success of our strategy as it impacts our ability to repay existing indebtedness as it matures and to make future investments. Our cost of and ability to access capital depend on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2009, only 8.3% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2009, our senior unsecured debt securities were rated BBB (stable) by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), BBB (stable) by Fitch Ratings and Ba1 (stable) by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys). On February 4, 2010, Moodys upgraded the rating on our unsecured debt securities to Baa3 (stable), giving us a third investment grade rating. To the extent it is reasonable to do so, and we believe it to be in the best interests of our stakeholders, we intend to maintain investment grade ratings on our senior debt securities and to manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. 2009 Highlights and Other Recent Developments Liquidity and Balance Sheet Following the upgrade by Moodys on February 4, 2010, our unsecured debt securities now have investment grade ratings from all three nationally recognized ratings agencies. We extended and amended the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities from 2010 to 2012. Additionally, we increased our aggregate borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facilities to $1.0 billion, of which $800.0 million matures on April 26, 2012 and $200.0 million matures on April 26, 2010. We issued and sold 13,062,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for aggregate proceeds of $312.2 million. We issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 1/2% senior notes due 2016, at a 15 3/4% discount to par value, for total proceeds of $168.5 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. We purchased in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers $361.6 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2015. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million related to these transactions. We repaid in full, at par, $49.8 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2009, and our mortgage debt obligations decreased by $148.7 million during 2009, including normal periodic principal amortization of $25.8 million and debt transfers of $38.8 million related to asset dispositions. We obtained first mortgage loans aggregating $172.6 million principal amount, secured by eighteen of our seniors housing communities with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.3% per annum. Investments We purchased four MOBs for an aggregate purchase price of $77.7 million, increasing our MOB investments to over 1.7 million square feet. We own one of these MOBs through a joint venture with a partner that provides management and leasing services for the property. We purchased one skilled nursing facility for $10.0 million and leased it to Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Brookdale Senior Living). We completed the development of two MOBs pursuant to an arrangement we entered into with a nationally recognized private developer of MOBs and healthcare facilities in 2008. That arrangement gave us the exclusive right, as part of a joint venture, to develop up to ten identified MOBs on hospital campuses in eight states. As of December 31, 2009, we had invested approximately $35.6 million in two MOBs under the arrangement. Dispositions We sold five seniors housing communities, one hospital, one MOB and one other property to the existing tenants for an aggregate sales price (before expenses) of $96.2 million and transferred related debt of $38.8 million. We recognized a net gain from the sales of these assets of $27.5 million. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We sold six skilled nursing facilities to Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Kindred) for total consideration of $58.0 million and recognized a gain from the sale of these assets of $39.3 million. Other We were included in the S&P 500 Index, widely regarded as the best single gauge of the large cap U.S. equities market. It includes 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. Kindred extended, from the renewal date of April 30, 2010 through April 30, 2015, the lease term for 109 assets (one of which we subsequently sold) that it leases from us. At December 31, 2009, annual cash rent on the remaining 108 assets was approximately $126 million. We received a favorable jury verdict of $101.6 million in our litigation against HCP, Inc. ( HCP) due to HCPs interference with our acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (Sunrise REIT) in 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates On July 1, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) launched the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), which changes U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) from a standards based model to a topical based model. The topics are organized by ASC number and are updated with an Accounting Standards Update. The ASC is the single source of nongovernmental authoritative GAAP for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP set forth in the ASC, as published by the FASB. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting treatment would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We apply FASB guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs), which requires the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and the determination of which a business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We must make judgments regarding our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. In making those judgments, we consider various factors, including the 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entitys governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity and determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the future, our assumptions may change, which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles Investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts, management agreements and related customer relationships. Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place tenant leases, above and or below market leases, other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations, as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue, as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset or on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. The fair value of in place leases, if any, reflects (i) the estimated value of any above and or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable, (ii) the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is also amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases, which includes the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. We calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which is approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition. Any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations, and we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. Future events could occur that would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Business Combinations For our acquisitions, we measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. Our acquisition related transaction costs are included in merger related expenses and deal costs on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to January 1, 2009, these costs were capitalized as part of the asset value at the time of the acquisition, as required by FASB guidance at that time. Loans Receivable Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances. Net deferred origination fees, which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor, (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant, and (v) current economic conditions. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. Fair Value We follow FASB guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and providing the necessary disclosures. The guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy). Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the reporting entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Additionally, if an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to the normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value. In addition, if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly, the entity shall place little, if any, weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale and classify them as a component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are recorded at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest income, including discount or premium amortization, on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold, which are based on the specific identification method, are reported in income from loans and investments on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We determined the valuation of our current investments in marketable securities using level one inputs. Additionally, we determined the valuation allowance for loan losses based on level three inputs. See Note 6 Loans Receivable of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We also follow FASB guidance relating to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments, which requires entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security into two components when (i) there are credit losses associated with the security that management asserts that it does not have an intent to sell and (ii) it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. The amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive loss. We have not recognized any other than temporary impairment. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living, provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. Base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured, and in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment. Our master lease agreements with Kindred (the Kindred Master Leases) and certain of our other leases provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met, rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees and all other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize resident fees and services, other than move in fees, monthly as services are provided. Move in fees, which are a component of resident fees and services, are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days notice. Federal Income Tax Since we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), prior to our acquisition of the assets of Sunrise REIT in April 2007 we made no provision for federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, however, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On January 1, 2010, we adopted FASB guidance related to variable interest accounting. The guidance requires an enterprise to analyze whether its variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The guidance requires an enterprise to perform this analysis on an ongoing basis and requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in VIEs. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations The tables below show our results of operations for each year and the absolute dollar and percentage changes in those results from year to year. Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 501,087 $ 481,368 $ 19,719 4.1 % Resident fees and services 421,058 429,257 (8,199 ) (1.9 ) Income from loans and investments 13,107 8,847 4,260 48.2 Interest and other income 842 4,226 (3,384 ) (80.1 ) Total revenues 936,094 923,698 12,396 1.3 Expenses: Interest 178,503 204,450 (25,947 ) (12.7 ) Depreciation and amortization 200,911 230,881 (29,970 ) (13.0 ) Property level operating expenses 302,813 306,944 (4,131 ) (1.3 ) General, administrative and professional fees (including non cash stock based compensation expense of $11,882 and $9,976 for the years ended 2009 and 2008, respectively) 38,830 40,651 (1,821 ) (4.5 ) Foreign currency loss (gain) 50 (162 ) 212 &gt;100 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 6,080 (2,398 ) 8,478 &gt;100 Merger related expenses and deal costs 13,015 4,460 8,555 &gt;100 Total expenses 740,202 784,826 (44,624 ) (5.7 ) Income before reversal of contingent liability, income taxes, discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest 195,892 138,872 57,020 41.1 Reversal of contingent liability 23,328 (23,328 ) nm Income tax benefit 1,719 15,885 (14,166 ) (89.2 ) Income from continuing operations 197,611 178,085 19,526 11.0 Discontinued operations 71,749 47,202 24,547 52.0 Net income 269,360 225,287 44,073 19.6 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax 2,865 2,684 181 6.7 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 266,495 $ 222,603 $ 43,892 19.7 % nm not meaningful Revenues The increase in our 2009 rental income can be attributed primarily to $6.4 million of additional rent resulting from the annual escalators in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2008 and 2009, $8.6 million in additional rent relating to triple net leased properties and MOBs acquired during 2008 and 2009, a rent reset increase of $1.8 million on four seniors housing communities and three skilled nursing facilities and various other escalations in the rent paid on our other existing properties. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Rental income included in discontinued operations was $3.6 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues related to our triple net leased properties segment consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual escalations) received directly from our tenants based on the terms of the applicable leases and generally do not depend on the operating performance of our properties. Therefore, while occupancy information is relevant to the operations of our tenants, our revenues and financial results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy levels or profits at the triple net leased properties. Resident fees and services consist of all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities that are managed by Sunrise, including rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. The decrease in resident fees and services during 2009 is attributed primarily to an increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact of $5.0 million in 2009, and lower average occupancy in our communities. Average occupancy rates related to these properties in 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Average Resident Occupancy Number ofCommunities For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Stabilized Communities 78 73 88.3 % 91.4 % Lease Up Communities 1 6 70.4 % 67.2 % Total 79 79 87.7 % 89.1 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 73 73 88.6 % 91.4 % Income from loans and investments increased during 2009 primarily due to interest earned on the investments we made during 2008 and 2009. See Note 6 Loans Receivable of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The decrease in our interest and other income during 2009 is primarily attributable to the resolution in 2008 of a legal dispute and higher interest rates earned on cash balances in 2008. Expenses Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $1.2 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, decreased $33.4 million in 2009 over 2008, primarily due to a $8.6 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates and a $25.6 million reduction in interest from lower loan balances. Interest expense includes $7.4 million and $6.4 million of amortized deferred financing fees for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008. An increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had a favorable impact on interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Approximately $28.9 million of the decrease in 2009 depreciation and amortization expense is due to in place lease intangibles related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition, which were fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Property level operating expenses include expenses incurred for the operations of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise, such as labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other property operating costs, operating expenses of our MOBs and loan receivable valuation allowances. Property level operating expenses decreased in 2009 primarily due to a $6.0 million loan receivable valuation allowance recorded in 2008, not related to our MOBs or Sunrise managed communities, and an increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had a favorable impact of $3.6 million in 2009. The decrease was partially 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements offset by approximately $4 million of property level expense credits and reconciliations related to our Sunrise managed communities in 2008 that did not recur in 2009 and MOB growth in 2009. The decrease in general, administrative and professional fees during 2009 is a result of lower professional fees and dead deal costs recorded in 2008, partially offset by an increase in non cash stock based compensation. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to the purchase, in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2008 primarily represents the purchase of $176.4 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in open market transactions for a discount. Merger related expenses and deal costs primarily consisted of expenses relating to our litigation with HCP arising out of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and, during 2009, deal costs now required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value. Other We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability for any built in gains tax related to the disposition of certain assets owned or deemed to be owned by us prior to our REIT election in 1999. The ten year period in which these assets were subject to built in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008. Because we had no pending or planned dispositions of these assets through December 31, 2008 and did not expect to pay any amounts related to this contingent liability, the $23.3 million deferred tax liability was reversed into income during 2008. Income tax benefit represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 11 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued operations for 2009 include a $67.3 million net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold during 2009. Discontinued operations for 2008 include a $39.0 million gain on the sale of twelve assets sold during 2008. See Note 5 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from its ownership percentage in 60 and 61 of our seniors housing communities during 2009 and 2008, respectively. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, Change 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Rental income $ 481,368 $ 459,046 $ 22,322 4.9 % Resident fees and services 429,257 282,226 147,031 52.1 Income from loans and investments 8,847 2,586 6,261 &gt;100 Interest and other income 4,226 2,839 1,387 48.9 Total revenues 923,698 746,697 177,001 23.7 Expenses: Interest 204,450 196,660 7,790 4.0 Depreciation and amortization 230,881 226,517 4,364 1.9 Property level operating expenses 306,944 198,125 108,819 54.9 General, administrative and professional fees (including non cash stock based compensation expense of $9,976 and $7,493 for the years ended 2008 and 2007, respectively) 40,651 36,425 4,226 11.6 Foreign currency gain (162 ) (24,280 ) 24,118 (99.3 ) Gain on extinguishment of debt (2,398 ) (88 ) (2,310 ) &gt;100 Merger related expenses and deal costs 4,460 2,979 1,481 49.7 Total expenses 784,826 636,338 148,488 23.3 Income before reversal of contingent liability, income taxes, discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest 138,872 110,359 28,513 25.8 Reversal of contingent liability 23,328 23,328 nm Income tax benefit 15,885 28,042 (12,157 ) (43.4 ) Income from continuing operations 178,085 138,401 39,684 28.7 Discontinued operations 47,202 142,177 (94,975 ) (66.8 ) Net income 225,287 280,578 (55,291 ) (19.7 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax 2,684 1,698 986 Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs 5,199 (5,199 ) nm Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 222,603 $ 273,681 $ (51,078 ) (18.7 )% nm not meaningful Revenues The increase in our 2008 rental income can be attributed primarily to $6.7 million of additional rent resulting from the annual escalators in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2007 and 2008 and $15.0 million in additional rent relating to triple net leased properties and MOBs acquired during 2007 and 2008. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Rental income included in discontinued operations was $20.0 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The increase in resident fees and services during 2008 is attributed to the fact that we did not acquire the Sunrise REIT properties until late April 2007 and, therefore, our results for 2007 reflect only eight months of Sunrise related revenues. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Average occupancy rates related to our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise in 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Average Resident Occupancy Number of Communities For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2008 2007 2008 2007 Stabilized Communities 73 72 91.4 % 93.0 % Lease Up Communities 6 7 67.2 % 58.8 % Total 79 79 89.1 % 90.4 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 72 72 91.4 % 93.0 % Income from loans and investments increased during 2008 primarily due to interest earned on a $50.0 million marketable debt security we purchased in early April 2008 and a first mortgage debt investment of $98.8 million we made in late 2008, partially offset by a gain on the sale of marketable equity securities of $0.9 million recognized in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in our interest and other income during 2008 is primarily attributable to the resolution in 2008 of a legal dispute. Expenses Interest expense included in discontinued operations was $8.7 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations, increased $3.4 million in 2008 over 2007, primarily due to $14.3 million of additional interest from higher loan balances as a result of our 2008 acquisition and loan activity, partially offset by a $11.8 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates and a $2.6 million loss due to early repayment of bridge financing in 2007 related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Interest expense includes $6.4 million and $4.8 million of amortized deferred financing fees for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008, from 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as result of the properties acquired during 2008 and 2007, partially offset by a $26.9 million decrease in amortization expense due to in place lease intangibles primarily related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. These in place lease intangibles were fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Property level operating expenses increased primarily due to the Sunrise REIT acquisition, the $6.0 million loan receivable valuation allowance recorded in the third quarter of 2008, and a $4.0 million increase related to the growth of our MOB business. Our results for 2007 reflect only eight months of expenses related to our Sunrise managed communities due to the late April 2007 acquisition of the Sunrise REIT properties. The increase in general, administrative and professional fees in 2008 is a result of our enterprise growth, an increase in non cash stock based compensation and dead deal costs. The foreign currency gain in 2007 primarily relates to the Canadian call option contracts we entered into in conjunction with the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. No similar contracts were in place during 2008. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2008 primarily represents the purchase of $176.4 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in open market transactions for a discount. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2007 represents the purchase of $5.0 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in an open market transaction for a discount. Merger related expenses and deal costs primarily consisted of expenses relating to our litigation with HCP arising out of the Sunrise REIT acquisition and, for 2007, also include incremental costs directly related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Other We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability to be utilized for any built in gains tax related to the disposition of certain assets owned or deemed to be owned by us prior to our REIT election in 1999. The ten year period in which these assets were subject to built in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008. Because we had no pending or planned dispositions of these assets through December 31, 2008 and did not expect to pay any amounts related to this contingent liability, the $23.3 million deferred tax liability was reversed into income during 2008. The decrease in discontinued operations is primarily the result of a $129.5 million gain recognized in 2007 from the sale of 22 assets, compared to a $39.0 million gain recognized in 2008 from the sale of twelve assets. See Note 5 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Preferred stock dividends and issuance costs in 2007 relate to the issuance and sale of 700,000 shares of our Series A Senior Preferred Stock to fund a portion of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, all of which we redeemed in May 2007 using the proceeds from the sale of our common stock. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Funds From Operations Our Funds From Operations (FFO) for the five years ended December 31, 2009 are summarized in the following table: For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands) Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 266,495 $ 222,603 $ 273,681 $ 131,154 $ 130,583 Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization 200,221 230,158 225,408 108,571 78,523 Real estate depreciation related to noncontrolling interest (6,349 ) (6,251 ) (3,749 ) Loss on real estate disposals 175 Discontinued operations: Gain on sale of real estate assets (67,305 ) (39,026 ) (129,478 ) (5,114 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 347 4,873 8,356 9,667 9,036 FFO 393,409 412,357 374,218 249,392 213,203 Adjustments: Reversal of contingent liability (23,328 ) (1,769 ) Provision for loan losses 5,994 Income tax benefit (3,459 ) (17,616 ) (29,095 ) Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 6,080 (2,398 ) (88 ) 1,273 1,376 Merger related expenses and deal costs 13,015 4,460 2,979 Net gain on sale of marketable equity securities (864 ) (1,379 ) Gain on foreign currency hedge (24,314 ) Preferred stock issuance costs 1,750 Bridge loan fee 2,550 402 Rent reset costs 7,361 Contribution to charitable foundation 2,000 Net proceeds from litigation settlement (15,909 ) Net gain on swap breakage (981 ) Normalized FFO 409,045 379,469 327,136 254,878 200,091 Straight lining of rental income .

Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider FFO and normalized FFO and Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) appropriate measures of performance of an equity REIT, and we use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We define normalized FFO as FFO excluding (a) gains and losses on the sales of assets, including marketable securities, (b) merger related costs and expenses and deal costs and expenses, including expenses relating to our lawsuit against HCP and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees, (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts or premiums incurred as a result of 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements early debt retirement or payment of our debt, including hedging transactions, (d) the non cash effect of income tax benefits, (e) the reversal of contingent liabilities, (f) gains and losses for foreign currency hedge agreements, (g) one time expenses in connection with the Kindred rent reset process, (h) net proceeds received by us in relation to litigation, and (i) contributions made to the Ventas Charitable Foundation. Normalized FAD represents normalized FFO excluding straight line rental adjustments and routine capital expenditures. FFO and normalized FFO and FAD presented herein are not necessarily comparable to FFO and normalized FFO and FAD presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO and normalized FFO and FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor are FFO and normalized FFO and FAD necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, FFO and normalized FFO and FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations and mortgage loans receivable. These market risks result primarily from changes in U.S. or Canadian LIBOR rates, the Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rates. We continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of the current and future economic environment. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect our fixed rate debt obligations until such instruments mature. However, changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. If interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or at the time we refinance such debt, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by the additional cost of borrowings. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time our debt matures or at the time of refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: As of December 31, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Gross book value $ 2,477,225 $ 2,592,730 Fair value (1) 2,572,472 2,436,620 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: (1) 100 BPS 2,681,982 2,538,334 +100 BPS 2,469,655 2,340,746 (1) The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to debt repayments and overall changes in interest rates, partially offset by additional borrowings. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts: As of December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate $ 2,477,225 $ 2,592,730 Variable rate 224,436 546,410 Total $ 2,701,661 $ 3,139,140 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.7 % 82.6 % Variable rate 8.3 % 17.4 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.3 % 6.5 % Variable rate 2.1 % 2.3 % Total weighted average rate 6.0 % 5.8 % The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to payments on our unsecured revolving credit facilities and certain repayments on our variable rate mortgage debt. Pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $80.0 million as of December 31, 2009, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2009, interest expense for 2010 would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately $1.7 million, or $0.01 per common share on a diluted basis. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. We have investments in marketable debt securities on which we earn interest on a fixed or floating rate basis. We record these investments as available for sale at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity. Interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair market value of these investments to change. As of December 31, 2009, the fair market value of our marketable debt securities, which had an original cost of $58.7 million, was $65.0 million. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our loans receivable was $129.5 million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans. See Note 6 Loans Receivable and Note 9 Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We are also subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our Canadian operations. Based on 2009 results, if the Canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by $0.10, our net income would decrease or increase, as applicable, by approximately $0.4 million per year. If we increase our international presence through investments in, and or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the United States, we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a Material Adverse Effect). Credit Risk We derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the Consumer Price Index, with caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenue from residents at our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise and tenants in our MOBs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 21.6% of our EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was derived from our senior living operations and MOBs, where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, Kindred accounted for $246.9 million, or 26.2%, of our total revenues and 38.5% of our total NOI (net operating income) (including amounts in discontinued operations), and $241.2 million, or 25.5%, of our total revenues and 38.0% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, Brookdale Senior Living accounted for $121.4 million, or 12.9%, of our total revenues and 19.1% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), and $121.5 million, or 12.8%, of our total revenues and 19.2% of our total NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations), respectively. This concentration of rental revenues and NOI creates credit risk. As a result, Kindreds and Brookdale Senior Livings financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us has a significant impact on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities, which could also affect its ability to pay rent to us. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Any inability or unwillingness of Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 3 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, senior living operations managed by Sunrise accounted for $421.1 million, or 44.7%, of our total revenues and 18.5% of our total EBITDA (including amounts in 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements discontinued operations), and $429.6 million, or 45.4%, of our total revenues and 20.0% of our total EBITDA (including amounts in discontinued operations), respectively. We are party to management agreements with Sunrise pursuant to which Sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to the management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee of 6% of resident fees and similar revenues, subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to NOI for a pool of properties. The minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is 5% of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties. We also pay incentive fees if a pool of properties exceeds aggregate performance targets relating to NOI; provided, however, that total management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 8% of resident fees and similar revenues. In 2009, we paid a 5.0% management fee for 76 properties and management fees of between 6.0% and 6.5% for three properties. The management agreements also specify that we (or the joint venture to which we are party, as applicable) will reimburse Sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities. We may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by Sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in each case to Sunrises rights to cure deficiencies. Each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to Sunrise. In addition, if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted NOI level for a given period, then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such underperforming pool. This targeted NOI level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property, with such projection escalating annually. However, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. As of December 31, 2009, we had 75% to 85% interests in 60 seniors housing communities owned in joint ventures with Sunrise, who only has protective rights related to major business decisions. Each of these joint ventures is managed by a board of managers or a general partner, each of which we control. As the controlling member or partner, as the case may be, we have sole authority to make all decisions for our Sunrise joint ventures, except for a limited set of major decisions, which generally include: the merger or disposition of substantially all the assets of the joint venture; the sale of additional interests in the joint venture; the dissolution of the joint venture; the disposition of a property owned by the joint venture; and the acquisition of any real property. We can generally transfer our interest in a Sunrise joint venture, without consent, to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors. However, Sunrise must obtain our prior consent for any direct or indirect transfer of its noncontrolling interest. With limited exceptions, profits and losses of the joint ventures are allocated on a pro rata basis in accordance with the ownership interests. If either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period, the non defaulting member may (i) revoke the capital contribution funding notice, (ii) advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member, with all of the defaulting members subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full, or (iii) advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each members proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements. Many of our Sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting members proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non defaulting member pursuant to option (iii). The joint ventures are generally limited to incurring new or refinanced mortgage indebtedness in excess of 75% of the market value of its properties. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Adverse developments in Sunrises business and affairs or financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Lease Expirations As our triple net leases expire, we are exposed to the risks that our tenants may elect not to renew their leases and, in such event, that we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on as favorable terms or at all. The following table summarizes our triple net lease expirations scheduled to occur over the next ten years.

The failure of our tenants to renew our leases could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We may be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our assets included in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2009, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from issuances of debt and equity securities, debt financings, sales of assets and cash flows from operations. During the next twelve months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay $173.8 million of mortgage debt; (iv) fund capital expenditures for our senior living operations and our MOBs; (v) fund acquisitions, investments and or commitments; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. We believe that these needs will be satisfied by cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt financings, proceeds from sales of assets and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. However, if these sources of capital are not available and or if we make significant acquisitions and investments, we may be required to obtain funding from additional borrowings, assumption of debt from the seller, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2009, we had a total of $107.4 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of investments in U.S. treasury money market funds and cash related to our senior living operations that is deposited and held in property level accounts. Funds maintained in the property level accounts 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements are used primarily for the payment of property level expenses and certain capital expenditures. A portion of the cash maintained in these property level accounts is distributed to us monthly. At December 31, 2009, we also had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $39.8 million, and unused credit availability of $988.4 million under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities Our aggregate borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facilities is $1.0 billion, of which $800.0 million matures on April 26, 2012 and $200.0 million matures on April 26, 2010. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate) plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. At December 31, 2009, the applicable percentage was 0.75% for 2010 maturities and 2.80% for 2012 maturities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities have a 20 basis point facility fee. The agreements governing our unsecured revolving credit facilities subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of February 15, 2010, we had approximately $9 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and approximately $155 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, for cash available of approximately $146 million. Convertible Senior Notes As of December 31, 2009, we had $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3 7/8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 outstanding. The convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity (December 1, 2011), in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at the current conversion rate of 22.9457 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a current conversion price of approximately $43.58 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price our earnings per share will be diluted. The indenture governing the convertible notes subjects us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the convertible notes. Senior Notes As of December 31, 2009, the following series of senior notes issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation, were outstanding: $1.4 million principal amount of 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2010; $82.4 million principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2012; $71.7 million principal amount of 6 5/8% Senior Notes due 2014; 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $142.7 million principal amount of 7 1/8% Senior Notes due 2015; $400.0 million principal amount of 6 1/2% Senior Notes due 2016; and $225.0 million principal amount of the 6 3/4% Senior Notes due 2017. During 2009, we issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2016 at a 15 3 /4% discount to par value for total proceeds of $168.5 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. We also repaid in full, at par, $49.8 million principal amount of our outstanding 8 3/4% senior notes due 2009 at maturity on May 1, 2009, and purchased in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers $361.6 million of our senior notes composed of: $121.6 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2010; $109.4 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2012; $103.3 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2014; and $27.3 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million related to these purchases. During 2008, we purchased $124.4 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2009 and $52.0 million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due 2010 in open market transactions. As a result of these purchases, we recorded a $2.5 million gain on the extinguishment of debt in 2008. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of the outstanding senior notes for cash and or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The indentures governing the senior notes subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. However, at any time we maintain investment grade ratings by both Moodys and S&P, the indentures provide that certain of these restrictive covenants will either be suspended or fall away. See Note 8 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We and certain of our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior notes. Mortgage Loan Obligations During 2008, we assumed $34.6 million of facility level mortgage debt in connection with certain property acquisitions. See Note 4 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Total facility level mortgage debt outstanding was approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. During 2009, we closed a pool of seventeen first mortgage loans through a government sponsored entity aggregating $132.1 million principal amount. These loans, which are secured by seventeen of our seniors housing communities, mature in July 2019 and bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.68% per annum. We also closed a first mortgage loan through a government sponsored entity in the original principal amount of $40.5 million. This loan is secured by one seniors housing community, matures in November 2014 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.14% per annum. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). Our quarterly dividends in 2009 aggregated $2.05 per share, which is greater than 100% of our 2009 estimated taxable income. We also intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of taxable income for 2010. On February 17, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.535 per share, payable in cash on March 31, 2010 to holders of record on March 12, 2010. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Requirements for Qualification as a REIT Annual Distribution Requirements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital Expenditures Our tenants generally bear the responsibility to maintain and improve our triple net leased properties. Accordingly, we do not expect to incur any major capital expenditures in connection with these properties. After the terms of the triple net leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases, we anticipate funding any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our MOBs and our senior living communities managed by Sunrise, we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding Senior Notes. Our ability to borrow may also be limited by our lenders ability and willingness to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Equity Offerings In April 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Commission relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous automatic shelf registration statement, which expired pursuant to the Commissions rules. In April 2009, we completed the sale of 13,062,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement. We received $312.2 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which we used, together with our net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes due 2016, to fund our cash tender offers with respect to the outstanding senior notes, to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. In 2008, we sold 9,236,083 shares of our common stock in two underwritten public offerings pursuant to our previous shelf registration statement. We received aggregate proceeds of $409.0 million from the sales, which we used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Other We received proceeds of $2.2 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options. Future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have increased to 1.6 million as of December 31, 2009, from 1.4 million as of December 31, 2008. The average weighted exercise price was $35.85 as of December 31, 2009. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We issued approximately 20,800 and 18,400 shares of common stock under our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, for net proceeds of $0.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We currently offer a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. Cash Flows Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $422.1 million and $379.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2009 primarily due to higher rental income, lower interest expense and changes in working capital, partially offset by lower NOI from our senior living operations and increased merger related expenses and deal costs. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 million and $136.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These activities consisted primarily of investments in real estate ($45.7 million and $53.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively), capital expenditures ($13.8 million and $16.4 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively), investments in loans receivable and marketable debt securities ($13.8 million and $172.5 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively), proceeds from mortgage loans ($8.0 million and $0.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively), proceeds from the sale of investments ($5.0 million in 2009) and proceeds from real estate disposals ($58.5 million and $104.2 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively). Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $490.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Proceeds primarily consisted of $365.7 million related to the issuance of debt and $299.2 million from the issuance of common stock. The uses primarily included $292.9 million of net payments made on our unsecured revolving credit facilities, $16.7 million of payments for deferred financing costs, $314.4 million of cash dividend payments to common stockholders, $411.5 million of senior note purchases and repayments, $113.7 million of aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations and $9.9 million of distributions to noncontrolling interest. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and included $288.8 million of cash dividend payments to common stockholders, $416.9 million of aggregate principal payments on mortgage obligations and $15.7 million of distributions to noncontrolling interest. The uses were partially offset by proceeds of $408.5 million from the issuance of common stock, $140.3 million from the issuance of debt and $73.4 million of net borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facilities. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2009.
