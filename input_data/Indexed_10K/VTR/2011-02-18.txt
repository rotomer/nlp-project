ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, we, us or our). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Our corporate and operating environment; 2010 operating highlights; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; Asset and liability management; Our liquidity and capital resources; Our cash flows; and Contractual obligations. Corporate and Operating Environment We are a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2010, our portfolio consisted of 602 assets: 240 seniors housing communities, 187 skilled nursing facilities, 40 hospitals and 135 medical office buildings (MOBs) and other properties in 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian 46 Table of Contents provinces. With the exception of our seniors housing communities that are managed by independent third parties, such as Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Sunrise), pursuant to long term management agreements and certain of our MOBs, other than those acquired in connection with our Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. (Lillibridge) acquisition (see Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K), we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. We also had real estate loan and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or properties as of December 31, 2010. Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers. Through our Lillibridge subsidiary, we also provide management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States. We currently operate through three reportable business segments: triple net leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations. See Note 19 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2010, we had: 100% ownership interests in 538 of our properties, including all 79 of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise; controlling interests in six MOBs owned through joint ventures with partners who provide management and leasing services for the properties; and noncontrolling interests ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs owned through joint ventures with institutional third party partners. Through our Lillibridge subsidiary, we also managed an additional 31 MOBs for third parties as of December 31, 2010. Our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives: (1) generating consistent, reliable and growing cash flows; (2) maintaining a well diversified portfolio; and (3) preserving our investment grade balance sheet and liquidity. Access to external capital is critical to the success of our strategy as it impacts our ability to repay maturing indebtedness and to make future investments. Our access to and cost of capital depend on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2010, only 5.3% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt. 2010 Operating Highlights 2010 Highlights Since February 2010, our senior unsecured debt securities have maintained investment grade ratings by all three nationally recognized rating agencies. During 2010, we received $235.0 million of additional capital commitments for the portion of indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facilities maturing in 2012. We now have $1.0 billion of aggregate borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, all of which matures on April 26, 2012. Our Board of Directors declared four quarterly installments of our 2010 dividend in the amount of $0.535 per share, representing a 4.4% increase over our 2009 quarterly dividend. The quarterly installments of our 2010 dividend were paid in cash in March, June, September and December. During 2010, we sold seven seniors housing communities for approximately $60.5 million, including lease termination fees of $0.7 million, and recognized a gain from these sales of approximately $17.3 million. 47 Table of Contents In July 2010, we completed the acquisition of businesses owned and operated by Lillibridge and its related entities and their real estate interests in 96 MOBs and ambulatory facilities for approximately $381 million, including the assumption of $79.5 million of debt. As a result of the transaction, we acquired: a 100% interest in Lillibridges property management, leasing, construction and development, advisory and asset management services business; a 100% interest in 38 MOBs comprising 1.9 million square feet; a 20% joint venture interest in 24 MOBs comprising 1.5 million square feet; and a 5% joint venture interest in 34 MOBs comprising 2.3 million square feet. We are the managing member of these joint ventures and the property manager for the joint venture properties. Two institutional third parties hold the controlling interests in these joint ventures, and we have a right of first offer on those interests. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the assumption of mortgage debt. In connection with the acquisition, $132.7 million of mortgage debt was repaid. In December 2010, we purchased five MOBs under the Lillibridge platform for an aggregate purchase price of $36.6 million. Our portfolio now includes 158 owned or managed MOBs comprising 8.8 million square feet in 19 states and the District of Columbia. In September 2010, we entered into a $200.0 million three year unsecured term loan with Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The term loan is non amortizing and bears interest at an all in fixed rate of 4% per annum. The term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our unsecured revolving credit facilities. In October 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of privately owned Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates, Atria) for a total purchase price of $3.1 billion, comprised of $1.35 billion of our common stock (a fixed 24.96 million shares), $150 million in cash and the assumption or repayment of $1.6 billion of net debt. We will acquire from Atria 118 private pay seniors housing communities located primarily in affluent coastal markets such as the New York metropolitan area, New England and California. Atria, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is owned by private equity funds managed by Lazard Real Estate Partners. Prior to the closing, Atria will spin off its management company, which will continue to operate the acquired assets under long term management agreements with us. Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions. We expect to complete the transaction in the first half of 2011, although we cannot assure you that the transaction will close on such timetable or at all. In November 2010, we sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015 issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (Ventas Realty) and Ventas Capital Corporation, at a public offering price equal to 99.528% of par, for total proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. During 2010, we purchased or repaid $215.7 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes, and our mortgage debt obligations decreased by $190.5 million. In December 2010, we acquired Sunrises noncontrolling interests in 58 of our seniors housing communities currently managed by Sunrise for a total valuation of approximately $186 million, including assumption of Sunrises share of mortgage debt totaling $144 million. The noncontrolling interests acquired represented between 15% and 25% ownership interests in the communities, and we now own 100% of all 79 of our seniors housing communities managed by Sunrise. In December 2010, we and Sunrise modified the management agreements with respect to each of our 79 Sunrise managed seniors housing communities. Among other things, the modifications included: reduction of the management fee paid to Sunrise for the period from April 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 and for all of 2011 to 3.50% and 3.75% per annum, respectively, after which the annual base management fee will equal 6% of revenues (with a range of 5% to 7%); a cap on the amount of incentive management fees payable to Sunrise and allocated shared services expenses; enhanced rights and remedies for us in the event of a Sunrise default; and reallocation of the net operating income (NOI) performance thresholds to include a cushion for all 79 communities. 48 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, a different accounting treatment may have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically re evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We apply FASB guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs), which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We must make judgments regarding our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. We perform this analysis on an ongoing basis, and our ability to make accurate judgments regarding our influence or control over an entity and to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the future, our assumptions may change, which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles We record investments in real estate assets at cost. We account for acquisitions using the purchase method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in place leases, acquired lease contracts, tenant and customer relationships, trade names/trademarks and goodwill. Our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place leases, above and or below market leases and any debt assumed. These estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. In addition, we amortize the value assigned to above and or below 49 Table of Contents market leases as a component of revenue, unlike in place leases and other intangibles, which we include in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives. We determine the value of land based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset, on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions. The fair value of lease intangibles, if any, reflects (i) the estimated value of any above and or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods, (ii) the estimated value of in place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period, as if the acquired space was vacant, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease, and (iii) the estimated value of any above and or below market ground leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rental rate and the in place lease rate, which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease. We estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired, if any, by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer, the tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases, which includes the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. We estimate the value of trade names/trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize the resulting intangible over the estimated useful life. We calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. We do not amortize goodwill, which is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business. Impairment of Long Lived and Intangible Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations, and we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value. An impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination. If impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then the fair value of the asset is estimated. We determine the impairment expense by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value and recognize any shortfall from fair value as an expense in the current period. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, but more frequently if indicators arise. We compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting units carrying value. The fair values used in this evaluation of goodwill and real estate investments and intangibles are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections. These cash flow projections are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions, such as revenue and expense growth rates and discount rates. 50 Table of Contents Business Combinations For our acquisitions, we measure the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests at their fair values on the acquisition date. Our acquisition related transaction costs are included in merger related expenses and deal costs on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Prior to January 1, 2009, these costs were capitalized as part of the asset value at the time of the acquisition, as required by FASB guidance in effect at that time. Loans Receivable Loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances. Net deferred origination fees, which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method. We evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors, including (i) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan or lease agreement, (iii) the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor, (iv) the payment history of the borrower or tenant, and (v) current economic conditions. Our level of reserves, if any, for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. We record a reserve at the time it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including the contractual interest and principal payments of the loan. At the time a reserve is recorded, we typically cease recognizing interest income on the loan. Fair Value We follow FASB guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary disclosures. The guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy). Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as other observable inputs for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the reporting entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Additionally, if an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value. In addition, if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly, the entity shall place little, if any, weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. We record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale and classify them as a component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These securities are recorded at fair market value, with 51 Table of Contents unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report interest income, including discount or premium amortization, on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold, which are based on the specific identification method, in income from loans and investments on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We determined the fair value of our current investments in marketable securities using level one inputs. We determined the valuation allowance for loan losses based on level three inputs. See Note 6 Loans Receivable of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations are based on level three inputs. We estimate fair values based on cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information. We determine impairment in real estate investments, including intangibles and goodwill, utilizing cash flow projections that apply estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, which are classified as level three inputs. We also follow FASB guidance requiring entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security into two components when (i) there are credit losses associated with the security that management asserts that it does not have an intent to sell and (ii) it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. The amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive loss. We have not recognized any other than temporary impairments. Revenue Recognition Certain of our leases, including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living and the majority of our MOB leases, provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. We recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. Income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured, and in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment. Our master lease agreements with Kindred (the Kindred Master Leases) and certain of our other leases provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if such parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees, management advisory services and all other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize resident fees and services, other than move in fees, monthly as services are provided. We recognize move in fees on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement. Lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days notice. 52 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Since we have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), we made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of the assets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (Sunrise REIT) in April 2007. As a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, would be included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, would be included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards On December 21, 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010 29, which impacts any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the year had occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period when preparing the pro forma financial information for both the current and prior reporting periods. The guidance also requires that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative description regarding the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in reported pro forma revenues and earnings. This guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2011. We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations As of December 31, 2010, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple net leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations. Our triple net leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases, which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. Our senior living operations segment primarily consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the United States and Canada for which we engage independent third parties, such as Sunrise, to manage the operations. Our MOB operations segment primarily consists of acquiring, owning, developing, leasing and managing MOBs. With the addition of the Lillibridge businesses and properties in July 2010, we believed the segregation of our MOB operations into its own reporting segment would be useful in assessing the performance of this portion of our business in the same way that management intends to review our performance and make operating decisions. Prior to the acquisition, we operated through two reportable segments: triple net leased properties and senior living operations. 53 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 The table below shows our results of operations for each year and the dollar and percentage changes in those results from year to year.

We incur no direct operating expenses for this segment. The year over year increase in triple net leased properties segment NOI primarily reflects $6.2 million of additional rent resulting from the annual escalators in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2010, $0.8 million in additional rent from a seniors housing community we acquired in 2010 and various other escalations in the rent paid on our other existing properties. Revenues related to our triple net leased properties segment consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual escalations) received directly from our tenants based on the terms of the applicable leases and generally do not depend on the operating performance of our properties. Therefore, while occupancy information is relevant to the operations of our tenants, our revenues and financial results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy levels or profits at the triple net leased properties. Average occupancy rates related to 54 Table of Contents triple net leased properties we owned at December 31, 2010, for the third quarter of 2010, which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants, are shown below. Average Occupancy Number of for the Three Months Properties Ended September 30, at December 31, 2010 2010 Properties: Skilled Nursing Facilities 187 87.8 % Seniors Housing Properties 158 90.5 % Hospitals 40 54.6 % Segment NOI Senior Living Operations For the Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI Senior Living Operations: Total revenues $ 446,301 $ 421,058 $ 25,243 6.0 % Less: Property level operating expenses 291,831 290,045 1,786 0.6 Segment NOI $ 154,470 $ 131,013 $ 23,457 17.9 % Revenues related to our senior living operations segment are resident fees and services, which include all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. The year over year increase in senior living operations segment revenues is attributed primarily to a decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had a favorable impact of $8.2 million in 2010, $3.3 million of additional revenues from three seniors housing communities added to our portfolio in 2010 and late 2009, higher occupancy rates and higher average daily rates in our Sunrise managed communities. Average resident occupancy rates related to our senior living operations during 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Number of Communities Average Resident Occupancy at December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Stabilized Communities 80 78 89.1 % 88.3 % Lease Up Communities 2 1 84.3 % 70.4 % Total 82 79 88.9 % 87.7 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 78 78 89.1 % 88.3 % Property level operating expenses related to our senior living operations segment include labor, food, utility, marketing, management and other property operating costs. Property level operating expenses increased in 2010 over 2009 primarily due to a decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact of $5.4 million in 2010, $3.1 million of additional expenses from three seniors housing communities added to our portfolio in 2010 and late 2009 and increased expenses related to occupancy and revenue growth, partially offset by the receipt of a $5 million cash payment from Sunrise in 2010 for expense overages and a decrease of $4.2 million in management fees. 55 Table of Contents Segment NOI MOB Operations For the Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI MOB Operations: Rental income $ 69,747 $ 35,922 $ 33,825 94.2 % Medical office building services revenue 14,098 14,098 nm Total revenues 83,845 35,922 47,923 100 Less: Property level operating expenses 24,122 12,768 11,354 88.9 Medical office building services costs 9,518 9,518 nm Segment NOI $ 50,205 $ 23,154 $ 27,051 100 % nm not meaningful MOB operations segment revenues and property level operating expenses both increased year over year primarily due to additional rent relating to the MOBs we acquired during 2010 and 2009, including the Lillibridge portfolio. Average occupancy rates related to our MOB operations during 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Number of Properties at December 31, Occupancy at December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Stabilized MOBs 63 21 94.8 % 94.9 % Non Stabilized MOBs 6 5 73.9 % 73.9 % Total 69 26 91.5 % 89.6 % Same Store Stabilized MOBs 18 18 93.2 % 93.9 % Medical office building services revenue and costs are a direct result of the Lillibridge businesses that we acquired in July 2010. Segment NOI All Other All other NOI consists solely of income from loans and investments. Income from loans and investments increased in 2010 over the prior year due primarily to interest earned on the investments we made during 2010 and 2009. Interest Expense Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $1.1 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, increased $0.2 million in 2010 over 2009. This difference is due primarily to increased deferred financing fee amortization, increased land lease payments and a $0.4 million increase in interest from higher effective interest rates, partially offset by a $2.7 million reduction in interest from lower loan balances. Interest expense includes $9.0 million and $7.4 million of amortized deferred financing fees for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective interest rate was 6.4% for 2010, compared to 6.3% for 2009. A decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on interest expense of $0.7 million for 2010, compared to 2009. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the properties we acquired or developed during 2010 and 2009, including the Lillibridge portfolio. 56 Table of Contents General, Administrative and Professional Fees General, administrative and professional fees increased $11.0 million in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to the Lillibridge acquisition. Foreign Currency Gain/Loss The foreign currency loss in 2010 resulted primarily from the net change in our forward contract valuation compared to the revaluation of intercompany loans, partially offset by the Canadian exchange rate differential between the trade date and settlement date on a cash payment. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 relates primarily to our redemption in June 2010 of all $142.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 71/8% senior notes due 2015, our redemption in October 2010 of all $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 65/8% senior notes due 2014 and various mortgage repayments in December 2010. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to the purchase, in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes. Merger Related Expenses and Deal Costs Merger related expenses and deal costs consisted of expenses relating to our favorable $101.6 million jury verdict against HCP, Inc. (HCP) and subsequent cross appeals arising out of our Sunrise REIT acquisition, integration costs related to consummated transactions and deal costs required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value, which include certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Lillibridge acquisition and other deal costs for unconsummated transactions, including our pending Atria acquisition. Loss From Unconsolidated Entities Loss from unconsolidated entities for 2010 relates to the noncontrolling interests in joint ventures we acquired as part of the Lillibridge acquisition. We have ownership interests ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs. See Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Income Tax Expense/Benefit Income tax expense/benefit before noncontrolling interest represents amounts related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a result of the Sunrise REIT and Lillibridge acquisitions. The change from an income tax benefit in 2009 to a non cash income tax expense in 2010 is primarily due to increased NOI at our Sunrise managed seniors housing communities. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations for 2010 includes a $17.3 million gain on the sale of seven assets sold during 2010, lease termination fees of $0.7 million related to these assets and a $7.9 million previously deferred gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 upon repayment of a note to the buyer. Discontinued operations for 2009 includes a $66.8 million net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold during 2009 and a lease termination fee of $2.3 million related to these assets. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from its previous ownership percentage in 60 of our seniors housing communities during 2009 and 58 of our seniors housing communities for most of 2010. 57 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 The table below shows our results of operations for each year and the dollar and percentage changes in those results from year to year.

Average resident occupancy rates related to our senior living operations during 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Number of Communities Average Resident Occupancy at December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Stabilized Communities 78 73 88.3 % 91.4 % Lease Up Communities 1 6 70.4 % 67.2 % Total 79 79 87.7 % 89.1 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 73 73 88.6 % 91.4 % The decrease in property level operating expenses for 2009 over 2008 is attributed primarily to an increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had a favorable impact of $3.6 million in 2009 and various other cost savings, partially offset by approximately $4 million of property level expense credits and reconciliations related to our Sunrise managed communities in 2008 that did not recur in 2009. Segment NOI MOB Operations For the Year Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI MOB Operations: Rental income $ 35,922 $ 27,716 $ 8,206 29.6 % Less: Property level operating expenses 12,768 10,506 2,262 21.5 Segment NOI $ 23,154 $ 17,210 $ 5,944 34.5 % 59 Table of Contents Our MOB operations segment revenues increased in 2009 over 2008 due primarily to additional rent relating to the MOBs we acquired during 2008 and 2009. Occupancy rates related to our MOBs for 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Number of Properties Average Occupancy at December 31, For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2009 2008 Stabilized MOBs 21 19 94.9 % 95.4 % Non Stabilized MOBs 5 2 73.9 % 59.6 % Total 26 21 89.6 % 90.1 % Same Store Stabilized MOBs 18 18 93.9 % 94.8 % The increase in property level operating expenses during 2009 over 2008 is attributed primarily to the MOBs we acquired during 2008 and 2009. Segment NOI All Other All other NOI in 2009 consists solely of income from loans and investments, while 2008 includes a $6.0 million loan receivable valuation allowance not related to our reporting segments. Income from loans and investments increased $4.3 million in 2009 over 2008 due primarily to interest earned on the investments we made during 2008 and 2009. Interest and Other Income The decrease in our interest and other income during 2009 is primarily attributable to the resolution in 2008 of a legal dispute and higher interest rates earned on cash balances in 2008. Interest Expense Total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $2.7 million and $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, decreased $33.4 million during 2009 over 2008. This difference is due primarily to a $8.6 million reduction in interest from lower effective interest rates and a $25.6 million reduction in interest from lower loan balances. Interest expense includes $7.4 million and $6.4 million of amortized deferred financing fees for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective interest rate decreased to 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, from 6.6% for the prior year. An increase in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had a favorable impact on interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008. Depreciation and Amortization Approximately $28.9 million of the decrease in 2009 depreciation and amortization expense is due to in place lease intangibles related to the Sunrise REIT acquisition in 2007, which were fully amortized during the second quarter of 2008. General, Administrative and Professional Fees The decrease in general, administrative and professional fees during 2009 is a result of lower professional fees and dead deal costs recorded in 2008, partially offset by an increase in non cash stock based compensation. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to the purchase, in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior 60 Table of Contents notes. The gain on extinguishment of debt in 2008 primarily represents the purchase of $176.4 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes in open market transactions for a discount. Merger Related Expenses and Deal Costs Merger related expenses and deal costs consisted of expenses relating to our favorable $101.6 million jury verdict against HCP arising out of our Sunrise REIT acquisition and, during 2009, deal costs required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value. Reversal of Contingent Liability We had a $23.3 million deferred tax liability for any built in gains tax related to the disposition of certain assets owned or deemed to be owned by us prior to our REIT election in 1999. The ten year period in which these assets were subject to built in gains tax ended on December 31, 2008. Because we had no pending or planned dispositions of these assets through December 31, 2008 and did not expect to pay any amounts related to this contingent liability, the $23.3 million deferred tax liability was reversed into income during 2008. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit before noncontrolling interest represents a deferred benefit which is due solely to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a direct result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. See Note 12 Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations for 2009 includes a $66.8 million net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold during the year and a lease termination fee of $2.3 million related to these assets. Discontinued operations for 2008 includes a $39.0 million gain on the sale of twelve assets sold during the year and a lease termination fee of $1.6 million related to these assets. See Note 5 Dispositions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from its ownership percentage in 60 and 61 of our seniors housing communities during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Non GAAP Financial Measures We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider certain non GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure. Set forth below are descriptions of the non GAAP financial measures we consider relevant to our business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures we present herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 61 Table of Contents Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider Funds From Operations (FFO) and normalized FFO appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that normalized FFO provides useful information because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items. We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) gains and losses on the sales of real property assets; (b) merger related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries, if any, relating to our lawsuit against HCP and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees; (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) the non cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; (e) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions; (f) the reversal or incurrence of contingent liabilities; (g) gains and losses for non operational foreign currency hedge agreements; and (h) one time expenses in connection with the Kindred rent reset process. Our FFO and normalized FFO for the five years ended December 31, 2010 are summarized in the following table. The increase in our FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the prior year can be attributed primarily to rental increases from our triple net leased portfolio, higher NOI at our senior living operations portfolio due primarily to increased occupancy and higher average daily rates, and higher NOI at 62 Table of Contents our MOB operating portfolio due primarily to our Lillibridge acquisition, partially offset by higher general, administrative and professional fees due primarily to our Lillibridge acquisition.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non cash stock based compensation), excluding merger related expenses and deal costs, gains and losses on real estate disposals and asset impairments and or valuation allowances (including amounts in discontinued operations). The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted 63 Table of Contents EBITDA to net income (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net income $ 249,729 $ 269,360 $ 225,287 Adjustments: Interest 179,918 179,736 213,132 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt 9,791 6,080 (2,398 ) Taxes (including amounts in general, administrative and professional fees) 6,280 (519 ) (14,385 ) Reversal of contingent liability (23,328 ) Depreciation and amortization 206,064 201,258 235,754 Non cash stock based compensation expense 14,078 11,882 9,976 Merger related expenses and deal costs 19,243 13,015 4,460 Gain on sale of real estate assets (25,241 ) (67,305 ) (39,026 ) Provision for loan losses 5,994 Adjusted EBITDA $ 659,862 $ 613,507 $ 615,466 NOI We consider NOI an important supplemental measure to net income because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property level operating expenses and MOB services costs (including amounts in discontinued operations). The following is a reconciliation of NOI to total revenues (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Total revenues $ 1,016,867 $ 931,575 $ 919,145 Less: Interest and other income 484 842 4,226 Property level operating expenses 315,953 302,813 306,944 MOB services costs 9,518 NOI (excluding amounts in discontinued operations) 690,912 627,920 607,975 Discontinued operations 3,350 8,120 24,584 NOI (including amounts in discontinued operations) $ 694,262 $ 636,040 $ 632,559 Asset/Liability Management Asset/liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program. The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels. The asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 64 Table of Contents Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable and marketable debt securities. These market risks result primarily from changes in U.S. or Canadian LIBOR rates, the Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rates. We continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of the current and future economic environment. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect our fixed rate debt obligations until they mature. However, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. If interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or is refinanced, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of maturity or refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs. To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points (BPS) in interest rates as of December 31, 2010 and 2009: As of December 31, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Gross book value $ 2,771,695 $ 2,477,225 Fair value(1) 2,900,143 2,572,472 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates:(1) 100 BPS 3,008,630 2,681,982 +100 BPS 2,794,140 2,469,655 (1) The change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to overall changes in interest rates and a net increase in debt. 65 Table of Contents The table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts. As of December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other $ 1,537,433 $ 1,153,131 $ 1,364,608 Mortgage loans and other 1,234,263 1,324,094 1,228,123 Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 40,000 8,466 300,207 Mortgage loans 115,258 215,970 246,202 Total $ 2,926,954 $ 2,701,661 $ 3,139,140 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other 52.5 % 42.7 % 43.5 % Mortgage loans and other 42.2 % 49.0 % 39.1 % Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 1.4 % 0.3 % 9.6 % Mortgage loans 3.9 % 8.0 % 7.8 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other 5.1 % 6.3 % 6.6 % Mortgage loans and other 6.2 % 6.3 % 6.4 % Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 3.1 % 3.1 % 2.2 % Mortgage loans 1.5 % 2.0 % 2.4 % Total 5.4 % 6.0 % 5.8 % The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to mortgage repayments, partially offset by additional borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling $80.0 million as of December 31, 2010, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2010, interest expense for 2011 would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. We earn interest from investments in marketable debt securities on a fixed rate basis. We record these investments as available for sale at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity. Interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair value of these investments to change. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value of our marketable debt securities, which had an original cost of $58.7 million and $58.7 million, respectively, was $66.7 million and $65.0 million, respectively. 66 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of our loans receivable was $155.4 million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans. See Note 6 Loans Receivable and Note 10 Fair Values of Financial Instruments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates which may, from time to time, have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our senior living operations in Canada. Based on 2010 results, if the Canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by $0.10, our results from operations would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $0.01 million per year. If we increase our international presence through investments in, and or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the United States, we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a Material Adverse Effect). Concentration and Credit Risk We use concentration ratios to understand the potential risks of economic downturns involving our various asset types, geographic locations or tenants, operators or managers. We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. Investment mix measures the portion of our investments related to certain asset types or tenants, operators or managers. Operations mix measures the portion of our operating results attributable to certain tenants, operators or managers or geographic locations. The following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented: December 31, 2010 2009 Investment mix by type(1): Seniors housing communities 70.2 % 74.2 % Skilled nursing facilities 11.7 % 12.4 % MOBs 10.8 % 6.0 % Hospitals 5.0 % 5.3 % Loans receivable, net 2.2 % 2.0 % Other properties 0.1 % 0.1 % Investment mix by tenant, operator and manager(1): Sunrise 37.9 % 39.7 % Kindred 13.1 % 13.9 % Brookdale Senior Living 19.7 % 21.5 % (1) Ratios are based on the gross book value of real estate investments (including assets held for sale) as of each reporting date. 67 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Tenant, operator and manager operations mix: Revenues(1): Sunrise 43.4 % 44.7 % 45.4 % Kindred 24.2 % 26.2 % 25.5 % Brookdale Senior Living 11.9 % 12.9 % 12.4 % All others 17.5 % 14.7 % 15.3 % Adjusted EBITDA: Sunrise 22.7 % 20.4 % 21.7 % Kindred 34.6 % 39.2 % 39.6 % Brookdale Senior Living 17.0 % 18.6 % 18.9 % All others 25.7 % 21.8 % 19.8 % NOI: Sunrise 22.2 % 20.6 % 21.9 % Kindred 35.6 % 38.5 % 38.1 % Brookdale Senior Living 17.3 % 19.1 % 18.5 % All others 24.9 % 21.8 % 21.5 % Geographic operations mix(4): California 12.0 % 12.7 % 12.6 % Illinois 10.2 % 10.3 % 10.6 % Ontario 5.9 % 5.6 % 5.8 % Pennsylvania 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.6 % Massachusetts 5.0 % 5.3 % 5.9 % All others 58.3 % 59.0 % 58.1 % (1) Total revenues includes medical office building services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income. Revenues from properties sold or held for sale as of the reporting date are included in this presentation. (2) Ratios are based on total revenues for each period presented. Total revenues includes medical office building services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income. Revenues from properties held for sale as of the reporting date are included in this presentation. Revenues from properties sold as of the reporting date are excluded from this presentation. See Non GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional disclosure and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and NOI to our net income, as computed in accordance with GAAP. We derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the Consumer Price Index, with caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenue from individual residents at our seniors housing communities managed by independent third parties, such as Sunrise, and tenants in our MOBs. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 28.6% of our Adjusted EBITDA was derived from our senior living operations managed by Sunrise and MOB operations, where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions. Our reliance on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income creates credit risk. Kindreds and Brookdale Senior Livings financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us have a significant impact on our results of operations 68 Table of Contents and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and Note 3 Concentration of Credit Risk of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease and other agreements with our tenants and borrowers by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to 79 of our seniors housing communities pursuant to long term management agreements. Each management agreement has a term of 30 years from its effective date, the earliest of which began in 2004. Pursuant to the management agreements, we pay Sunrise a base management fee equal to a specified percentage of resident fees and similar revenues, subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to NOI for a pool of properties. For our 79 Sunrise managed communities, we paid management fees of 5% for the period from January 1, 2010 through March 31, 2010 and 3.5% for the period from April 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. For 2011, in accordance with the management agreements, as modified in December 2010, we will pay management fees of 3.75% of resident fees and similar revenues, and thereafter we will pay base management fees of 6% of resident fees and similar revenues (with a range of 5% to 7%). After 2011, we will also be obligated to pay incentive management fees if the properties exceed aggregate performance targets relating to NOI; provided, however, that total management fees, including incentive fees, shall not exceed 7% of resident fees and similar revenues. The management agreements also specify that we will reimburse Sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities. We may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by Sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof (including, in certain circumstances, the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation), subject in most cases to Sunrises rights to cure such defaults. Each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to Sunrise. In addition, the management agreements provide for termination rights if performance falls below specified NOI targets or if Sunrise fails to comply with certain expense control covenants. However, various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights. We acquired Sunrises noncontrolling interests in our joint ventures with Sunrise in December 2010 and now own 100% of our 79 Sunrise managed communities. See Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business The properties managed by Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Adverse developments in Sunrises business and affairs or financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Lease Expirations We are exposed to the risk that, as our triple net leases expire, our tenants may elect not to renew those leases and, in that event, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on as 69 Table of Contents favorable terms, if at all. The following table summarizes our triple net lease expirations scheduled to occur over the next ten years: % of 2010 Total Number of 2010 Annual Triple Net Rental Properties Rental Income Income(1) (Dollars in thousands) 2011 $ % 2012 4 3,874 0.8 2013 90 119,401 25.4 2014 3 3,332 0.7 2015 140 154,927 33.0 2016 1 1,054 0.2 2017 2018 1 399 0.1 2019 84 122,059 26.0 2020 6 11,233 2.4 (1) Total 2010 triple net rental income excludes income included in discontinued operations. The non renewal of some or all of our leases could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We may be unable to reposition our properties on as favorable terms, or at all, if we have to replace any of our tenants or operators, and we may be subject to delays, limitations and expenses in repositioning our assets included in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2010, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from issuances of debt, cash flows from operations, proceeds from dispositions, proceeds from repayments of loans receivable, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and cash on hand. During the next twelve months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt, including our convertible notes; (iv) fund capital expenditures for our senior living operations and our MOB operations; (v) fund acquisitions, including our pending Atria transaction, investments and or commitments, including development activities; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Except as discussed below, we believe that these needs will be satisfied by cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt financings, issuance of equity securities, proceeds from sales of assets and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. However, if these sources of capital are not available and or if we make significant acquisitions and investments, we may be required to obtain funding from additional borrowings, assume debt from the seller, dispose of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and or issue secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. We expect to fund the Atria transaction through the issuance of 24.96 million shares of our common stock, cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and assumed mortgage financing. See Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business plan included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of $21.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, operating cash and cash related to our senior living operations and MOB operations that is deposited and held in property level accounts. Funds maintained in the property level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property level expenses and certain capital expenditures. At December 31, 2010, we also had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $38.9 million and $956.8 million of unused borrowing capacity available under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. 70 Table of Contents Unsecured Revolving Credit Facilities At December 31, 2010, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facilities was $1.0 billion, all of which matures on April 26, 2012. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum (based on U.S. or Canadian LIBOR, the Canadian Bankers Acceptance rate, or the U.S. or Canadian Prime rate), plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage. At December 31, 2010, the applicable percentage was 2.80%. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also have a 20 basis point facility fee. In October 2010, we amended the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facilities to release the subsidiary guarantees thereunder. The agreements governing our unsecured revolving credit facilities subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Convertible Senior Notes As of December 31, 2010, we had $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 outstanding. The convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder (i) prior to September 15, 2011, upon the occurrence of specified events and (ii) on or after September 15, 2011, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day prior to the stated maturity (December 1, 2011), in each case into cash up to the principal amount of the convertible notes and cash or shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the principal amount at the current conversion rate of 23.2133 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which equates to a current conversion price of approximately $43.08 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.395 per share. To the extent the market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price our earnings per share will be diluted. In September 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on our outstanding convertible notes (other than the guarantee by Ventas Realty) were released pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the notes. The indenture governing the convertible notes subjects us to a number of restrictive covenants. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Senior Notes and Other As of December 31, 2010, the following series of senior notes issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty and Ventas Capital Corporation, were outstanding: $82.4 million principal amount of 9% senior notes due 2012; $400.0 million principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015; $400.0 million principal amount of 61/2% senior notes due 2016; and $225.0 million principal amount of 63/4% senior notes due 2017. In May 2010, we repaid in full, at par, $1.4 million principal amount then outstanding of our 63/4% senior notes due 2010 upon maturity. In June 2010, we exercised our option to redeem all $142.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 71/8% senior notes due 2015, at a redemption price equal to 103.56% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $147.8 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million during the second quarter of 2010. In October 2010, we exercised our option to redeem all $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 65/8% senior notes due 2014, at a redemption price equal to 102.21% of par, plus accrued and unpaid 71 Table of Contents interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $73.3 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2010. In September 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on our outstanding senior notes (other than our 9% senior notes due 2012) were released pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the notes. In November 2010, we issued and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125% senior notes due 2015, at a public offering price equal to 99.528% of par, for total proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. During 2009, we issued and sold $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 61/2% senior notes due 2016 at a 153/4% discount to par value for total proceeds of $168.5 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. We also repaid in full, at par, $49.8 million principal amount then outstanding of our 83/4% senior notes due 2009 upon maturity and purchased in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers $361.6 million of our senior notes composed of: $121.6 million principal amount then outstanding of our 63/4% senior notes due 2010; $109.4 million principal amount then outstanding of our 9% senior notes due 2012; $103.3 million principal amount then outstanding of our 65/8% senior notes due 2014; and $27.3 million principal amount then outstanding of our 71/8% senior notes due 2015. We recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.1 million related to these purchases. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding senior notes for cash and or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes subject us to a number of restrictive covenants. However, at any time we maintain investment grade ratings by both Moodys Investor Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services, the indentures governing our 2012, 2016 and 2017 senior notes provide that certain of these restrictive covenants will either be suspended or fall away. See Note 9 Borrowing Arrangements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In September 2010, we entered into a $200.0 million three year unsecured term loan with Bank of America, N.A., as lender. The term loan is non amortizing and bears interest at an all in fixed rate of 4% per annum. The term loan contains the same restrictive covenants as our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Mortgage Loan Obligations Total facility level mortgage debt outstanding was approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In June 2010, we repaid $49.8 million of mortgage loans on two of our Sunrise managed properties in which we previously had 80% ownership interests. In connection with our payment of Sunrises share ($9.9 million) of those mortgage loans, we acquired Sunrises 20% noncontrolling interests in the properties. In July 2010, in connection with our acquisition of Lillibridge and its related entities, we assumed $79.5 million of mortgage debt. See Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. During 2009, we closed a pool of seventeen first mortgage loans through a government sponsored entity aggregating $132.1 million principal amount. These loans, which are secured by seventeen of our seniors housing communities, mature in July 2019 and bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.68% per annum. We also closed a first mortgage loan through a government sponsored entity in the original principal amount of $40.5 million. This loan is secured by one seniors housing community, matures in November 2014 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.14% per annum. 72 Table of Contents Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). Our quarterly dividends in 2010 aggregated $2.14 per share, which exceeds 100% of our 2010 estimated taxable income. We also intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of taxable income for 2011. On February 16, 2011, our Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2011 dividend of $0.575 per share, payable in cash on March 31, 2011 to holders of record on March 11, 2011. We expect that REIT taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we anticipate that we generally will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Requirements for Qualification as a REIT Annual Distribution Requirements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital Expenditures Our tenants generally bear the responsibility of maintaining and improving our triple net leased properties. Accordingly, we do not expect to incur any major capital expenditures in connection with these properties. After the terms of the triple net leases expire, or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases, we anticipate funding any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our senior living and MOB operations, we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to borrow may also be limited by our lenders ability and willingness to fund, in whole or in part, borrowing requests under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Equity Offerings In February 2011, we completed the sale of 5,563,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement. We received $300.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which we intend to use to repay existing mortgage debt and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions or investments, if any. In March 2010, we filed a registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC relating to the resale, from time to time, by the selling stockholders of shares of our common stock, if any, that may become issuable upon conversion of our outstanding 37/8% convertible senior notes due 2011. The registration statement replaced our previous resale shelf registration statement, which expired pursuant to the SECs rules. In April 2009, we completed the sale of 13,062,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement. We received $312.2 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale, which we used, together with our net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes due 2016, to fund our cash tender offers for our outstanding senior notes, to repay debt and for general corporate purposes. In April 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement replaced our previous automatic shelf registration statement, which expired pursuant to the SECs rules. 73 Table of Contents Other We received proceeds of $11.1 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options. Future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future performance of our stock price and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding have increased to 1.7 million as of December 31, 2010, from 1.6 million as of December 31, 2009. The average weighted exercise price was $38.12 as of December 31, 2010. We issued approximately 41,600 and 20,800 shares of common stock under our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, for net proceeds of $2.1 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We currently offer a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. Cash Flows The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: For the Year Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 107,397 $ 176,812 $ (69,415 ) 39.3 % Net cash provided by operating activities 447,622 422,101 25,521 6.0 Net cash used in investing activities (301,920 ) (1,746 ) (300,174 ) 100 Net cash used in financing activities (231,452 ) (490,180 ) 258,728 52.8 Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents 165 410 (245 ) 59.8 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 21,812 $ 107,397 $ (85,585 ) 79.7 % Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2010 primarily due to increases in FFO, as previously discussed, partially offset by a net decrease in working capital. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2010 and 2009 consisted primarily of our investments in real estate ($274.4 million and $45.7 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively), purchase of noncontrolling interests ($42.3 million in 2010), investments in loans receivable ($38.7 million and $13.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively), contributions to unconsolidated entities ($4.7 million in 2010) and capital expenditures ($19.9 million and $13.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively). These uses were partially offset by proceeds from real estate disposals ($58.2 million and $58.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively), proceeds from loans receivable ($19.3 million and $8.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively) and proceeds from the sale of investments ($5.0 million in 2009). Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2010 consisted primarily of $524.8 million of debt repayments, $336.1 million of cash dividend payments to common stockholders, $8.1 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests and $2.7 million of payments for deferred financing costs. These uses were partially offset by $597.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and $28.6 million of net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. 74 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities during 2009 consisted primarily of $525.2 million of debt repayments, $314.4 million of cash dividend payments to common stockholders, $292.9 million of net payments made on our unsecured revolving credit facilities, $9.9 million of distributions to noncontrolling interests and $16.7 million of payments for deferred financing costs. These uses were partially offset by $365.7 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and $299.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2010: Less Than More Than Total 1 Year(4) 1 3 Years(5) 3 5 Years(6) 5 Years (7) (In thousands) Long term debt obligations(1)(2) $ 3,735,842 $ 442,473 $ 1,070,496 $ 740,998 $ 1,481,875 Acquisition commitments(3) 3,100,000 3,100,000 Operating and ground lease obligations 158,118 3,686 7,360 6,076 140,996 Total $ 6,993,960 $ 3,546,159 $ 1,077,856 $ 747,074 $ 1,622,871 (1) Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.

(5) Includes $82.4 million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due 2012, $200.0 million outstanding principal amount of our unsecured term loan due 2013 and $40.0 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facilities that matures in 2012. (6) Includes $400.0 million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due 2015. (7) Includes $400.0 million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due 2016 and $225.0 million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due 2017. As of December 31, 2010, we had $17.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been excluded from the table above, as we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authority.
