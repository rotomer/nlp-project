ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Ventas, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, "we," "us" or "our"). You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis will help you understand: Who we are and the environment in which we operate; Our 2011 operating highlights and recent developments; Our critical accounting policies and estimates; Our results of operations for the last three years; How we manage our assets and liabilities; Our liquidity and capital resources; Our cash flows; and Our future contractual obligations. Corporate and Operating Environment We are a real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2011, 53 Table of Contents we owned 1,378 properties located in 46 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces, consisting of: 678 seniors housing communities; 396 skilled nursing facilities; 47 hospitals; 249 medical office buildings ("MOBs"); and eight personal care facilities. We also were in the process of developing three properties as of December 31, 2011. We are headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and have been a constituent member of the S&P 500&reg; Index, a leading indicator of the large cap U.S. equities market, since March 2009. Our primary business focuses on acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to unaffiliated tenants or operating those properties through independent third party managers. Through our Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. ("Lillibridge") subsidiary and our ownership interest in PMB Real Estate Services LLC ("PMBRES"), which we acquired in July 2011 in connection with our acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "NHP"), we also provide MOB management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States. In addition, from time to time, we make mortgage loan and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies or properties. We currently operate through three reportable business segments: triple net leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations. See "Note 20 Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of December 31, 2011, we had: 100% ownership interests in 1,257 properties; controlling interests in eleven MOBs and eighteen seniors housing communities owned through joint ventures with third parties; and noncontrolling interests ranging between 5% and 25% in 58 MOBs, 20 seniors housing communities and fourteen skilled nursing facilities owned through joint ventures with third parties. Through Lillibridge and PMBRES, we also provided management and leasing services to third parties with respect to 44 MOBs as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we leased 929 properties (excluding MOBs) to healthcare operating companies under "triple net" or "absolute net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and we engaged independent third parties, such as Atria Senior Living, Inc. ("Atria") and Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Sunrise"), to manage 200 seniors housing communities pursuant to long term management agreements. Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Kindred") and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. ("Brookdale Senior Living") leased 198 and 167 of our properties, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 (excluding six properties included in investments in unconsolidated entities). Our business strategy focuses on three principal objectives: (1) generating consistent, reliable and growing cash flows; (2) maintaining a well diversified portfolio; and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity. Access to external capital is critical to the success of our business strategy as it impacts our ability to meet our existing commitments, including repaying maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. Our access to and cost of capital depend on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of our investments in senior housing and healthcare properties with long term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of fixed rate debt. At December 31, 2011, only 22.1% of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt (excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale). 54 Table of Contents 2011 Operating Highlights and Recent Developments In 2011, our Board of Directors declared and we paid cash dividends on our common stock in the aggregate amount of $2.30 per share, representing a 7.5% increase over our aggregate 2010 dividends of $2.14 per share. In February 2011, we completed the sale of 5,563,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement and used the aggregate proceeds of $300.0 million to repay existing mortgage debt and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Also in February 2011, we repaid in full mortgage loans outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $307.2 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.5 million in connection with this repayment in the first quarter of 2011. In May 2011, we issued and sold $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2021, at a public offering price equal to 99.132% of par for total proceeds of $693.9 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. Also in May 2011, we acquired substantially all of the real estate assets and working capital of privately owned Atria Senior Living Group, Inc. (together with its affiliates, "ASLG"), which added 117 seniors housing communities and one land parcel to our senior living operating portfolio. See "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In July 2011, we acquired publicly traded NHP in a stock for stock transaction, which expanded our portfolio by 643 seniors housing and healthcare properties. See "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In July 2011, we: amended our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as previously amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of our capital stock to 610,000,000, comprised of 600,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock; amended our Fourth Amended and Restated By Laws to increase the maximum number of directors allowed to serve on the Board of Directors at any time from eleven to thirteen; and appointed three former NHP directors to our Board. Also in July 2011, we redeemed $200.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 61/2% senior notes due 2016, at a redemption price equal to 103.25% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, and we repaid in full, at par, $339.0 million principal amount then outstanding of NHPs 6.50% senior notes due 2011 upon maturity. In August 2011, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky ruled that HCP, Inc. ("HCP") could not further delay enforcement of our $101.6 million compensatory damages award, and HCP paid us $102.8 million for the judgment plus certain costs and interest; in November 2011, HCP paid us an additional $125 million in final settlement of our outstanding lawsuit against HCP; and for the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $202.3 million in net income as a result of this litigation, after certain fees and expenses, the contingent fee for our outside legal counsel and donations to the Ventas Charitable Foundation, which supports worthwhile causes important to our customers, our employees and our communities. See "Note 16 Litigation" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In October 2011, we repaid all borrowings outstanding and terminated the commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and entered into a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving 55 Table of Contents credit facility, currently priced at LIBOR plus 110 basis points. See "Note 10 Borrowing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In November 2011, we repaid in cash $230.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 37/8% convertible senior notes due 2011 upon maturity and issued an aggregate of 943,714 shares of our common stock in settlement of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In December 2011, we entered into a new $500.0 million unsecured term loan facility with a weighted average maturity of 4.5 years, priced at LIBOR plus 125 basis points, and concurrently terminated the commitments under the $800.0 million term loan that we assumed in connection with the NHP acquisition. In December 2011, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire publicly traded Cogdell Spencer Inc. ("Cogdell"), and its 72 MOBs in an all cash transaction. During 2011, we also invested approximately $329.5 million, including the assumption of $134.9 million in debt, in MOBs and seniors housing communities. During 2011, we received aggregate proceeds of $218.5 million in final repayment of eight secured loans receivable and recognized an aggregate gain of $4.4 million in connection with these repayments for the year ended December 31, 2011. In February 2012, we issued and sold $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2022, at a public offering price equal to 99.214% of par, for total proceeds of $595.3 million before the underwriting discount and expenses. In February 2012, we sold nine seniors housing communities for aggregate consideration of $121.3 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see "Note 2 Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in 56 Table of Contents consolidation, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We apply FASB guidance for arrangements with variable interest entities ("VIEs"), which requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entitys activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We may change our original assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entitys equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. We perform this analysis on an ongoing basis. We also apply FASB guidance related to investments in joint ventures based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s) that may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances in which the general partner would otherwise consolidate the joint venture. We assess limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner when an investor becomes the sole general partner, and we reassess if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies. Business Combinations We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and allocate the cost of the properties acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in place leases, acquired lease contracts, tenant and customer relationships, trade names/trademarks and goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business and is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings, land and improvements, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place leases, above and or below market leases, purchase option intangible assets and or liabilities, and any debt assumed. These estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. In addition, we amortize the value assigned to above and or below market leases as a component of revenue, unlike in place leases and other intangibles, which we include in depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 57 Table of Contents We estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, not to exceed 35 years. We determine the allocated value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. We determine the value of land by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on (a) internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or (b) real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset. The fair value of acquired lease intangibles, if any, reflects (i) the estimated value of any above and or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and the in place rent, the resulting intangible asset or liability of which we amortize to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any bargain renewal periods, and (ii) the estimated value of in place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period as if the acquired space was vacant, which we amortize to amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed, all unamortized amounts of lease intangibles would be recognized in operations at that time. We estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets or liabilities by discounting the difference between the applicable propertys acquisition date fair value and an estimate of the future option price. We do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon exercise of the purchase option. We estimate the fair value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired, if any, by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer, the tenants credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant and amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases, including the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. We estimate the fair value of trade names/trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize that value over the estimated useful life of the trade name/trademark. In connection with a business combination, we may assume the rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. We assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. In connection with our recent acquisitions, all capital leases acquired or assumed contain bargain purchase options that we intend to exercise. Therefore, we recognized an asset based on the acquisition date fair value of the underlying property and a liability based on the acquisition date fair value of the capital lease obligation. We depreciate assets recognized under capital leases that contain bargain purchase options over the assets useful life. We assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable given current market conditions on the acquisition date. To the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability, respectively, at fair value, and we amortize the recognized asset or liability (excluding purchase option intangibles) to interest or rental expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the applicable lease term. We include all lease related intangible assets and all lease related intangible liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 58  Table of Contents We determine fair value of loans receivable acquired in connection with a business combination by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities and same terms would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The estimated future cash flows reflect our judgment regarding the uncertainty of those cash flows, so we do not establish a valuation allowance at the acquisition date. We recognize the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows as interest income using an effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we evaluate changes regarding the uncertainty of future cash flows and the need for a valuation allowance. We estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed using assumptions that are consistent with those used in valuing all of the underlying assets and liabilities. We base the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities on the fair value of the assets at the time we acquired the joint venture interest. We estimate fair values for our equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. The capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads we use in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. We generally amortize any difference between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and include it in our share of income or loss from unconsolidated entities. In other instances, net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method. We calculate the fair value of long term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate we would expect to incur to replace the instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument. We record a liability for contingent consideration (included in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets) at fair value as of the acquisition date and reassess the fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any changes being recognized in earnings. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration can result from changes in discount periods, discount rates and probabilities that contingencies will be met. Impairment of Long Lived and Intangible Assets We periodically evaluate our long lived assets, primarily consisting of our investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination. If impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then we estimate the fair value of the asset. We determine the impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value and recognize any shortfall from fair value as a loss in the current period. 59 Table of Contents We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture may exceed the fair value. If it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence, including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, but more frequently if indicators arise. We first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors we assess include current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets and our overall financial and operating performance. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we proceed with the two step approach to evaluating impairment. In the first step of this approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to the reporting units carrying value. Should the carrying value exceed fair value, we proceed with the second step. The second step of this approach requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be assigned to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. We recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value in the current period. Estimates of fair value used in this evaluation of goodwill, investments in real estate and intangibles are based upon discounted future cash flow projections, which are, in turn, based upon a number of estimates and assumptions, such as revenue and expense growth rates and discount rates. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Loans Receivable We record loans receivable, other than those acquired in connection with a business combination, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (either in secured loans receivable, net or, with respect to unsecured loans receivable, other assets) at the unpaid principal balance, net of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums and valuation allowances. We amortize net deferred origination fees, which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method and recognize any unamortized balances in income immediately if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity. We regularly evaluate the collectibility of loans receivable based on several factors, including without limitation (i) corporate and facility level financial and operational reports, (ii) compliance with any financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan agreement, (iii) the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantor, (iv) the payment history of the borrower, and (v) current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the applicable loan agreement, we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be collected. Fair Value We follow FASB guidance that defines fair value and provides direction for measuring fair value and making the necessary related disclosures. The guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market 60 Table of Contents based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy). Level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access. Level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as other inputs for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves, that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on the reporting entitys own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. If the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. If an entity determines there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value. In addition, if there is evidence that the transaction for the asset or liability is not orderly, the entity shall place little, if any, weight on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Revenue Recognition Triple Net Leased Properties and MOB Operations Certain of our triple net leases, including the majority of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living and the majority of leases we acquired in connection with the NHP acquisition, and most of our MOB leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. We recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our master lease agreements with Kindred (the "Kindred Master Leases") and certain of our other leases provide for periodic increases in base rent only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases as the related parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a straight line basis over the applicable lease term. Senior Living Operations We recognize resident fees and services, other than move in fees, monthly as services are provided. We recognize move in fees on a straight line basis over the average resident stay. Our lease agreements with residents generally have a term of twelve to eighteen months and are cancelable by the resident upon 30 days notice. 61 Table of Contents Other We recognize interest income from loans, including discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method when collectibility is reasonably assured. We apply the effective interest method on a loan by loan basis and recognize discounts and premiums as yield adjustments over the related loan term. We recognize interest income on an impaired loan to the extent our estimate of the fair value of the collateral is sufficient to support the balance of the loan, other receivables and all related accrued interest. When the balance of the loan, other receivables and all related accrued interest is equal to our estimate of the fair value of the collateral, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. We provide a reserve against an impaired loan to the extent our total investment in the loan exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the loan collateral. We recognize income from rent, lease termination fees, development services, management advisory services and all other income when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff Accounting Bulletin 104: (i) the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Allowances We assess the collectibility of our rent receivables, including straight line rent receivables, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and our reserve policy, and we defer recognition of revenue if collectibility is not reasonably assured. We base our assessment of the collectibility of rent receivables (excluding straight line receivables) on several factors, including, among other things, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to recover the full value of the receivable, we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered. We base our assessment of the collectibility of straight line receivables on several factors, including, among other things, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the historical operations and operating trends of the property, the historical payment pattern of the tenant, and the type of property. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to receive the rent payments due in the future, we defer recognition of the straight line rental income and, in certain circumstances, provide a reserve against the previously recognized straight line rent receivable asset for a portion, up to its full value, that we estimate may not be recovered. If we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease, we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized and or to increase or reduce the reserve against the existing straight line rent receivable. Federal Income Tax We have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999 and made no provision for federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of the assets of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust ("Sunrise REIT") in April 2007. As a result of the Sunrise REIT and subsequent acquisitions, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as "taxable REIT subsidiaries" under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 62 Table of Contents using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011 10, Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification ("ASU 2011 10"), which clarifies certain guidance for situations in which a reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is, in substance, real estate as a result of default on the subsidiarys nonrecourse debt. In such situations, ASU 2011 10 requires a company to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, in determining whether it should derecognize the real estate assets. The provisions of ASU 2011 10 will be effective for us beginning with fiscal year 2013, and are not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ("ASU 2011 08"), which permits companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing the current two step analysis. If a company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the company must proceed with the two step approach to evaluating impairment. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2011 08 in 2011, and the adoption did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, on January 1, 2011, we adopted ASU 2010 28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts ("ASU 2010 28"). ASU 2010 28 states that if a reporting unit has a carrying amount that is equal to or less than zero and there are qualitative factors that indicate it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The adoption of ASU 2010 28 also did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ("ASU 2011 05"), which amends current guidance found in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011 05 requires entities to present comprehensive income in either: (i) one continuous financial statement or (ii) two separate but consecutive statements that display net income and the components of other comprehensive income. Totals and individual components of both net income and other comprehensive income must be included in either presentation. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011 12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05 ("ASU 2011 12"). The provisions of ASU 2011 12 indefinitely defer portions of ASU 2011 05 related to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The provisions of both ASU 2011 05 and ASU 2011 12 will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2012. On January 1, 2011, we adopted ASU 2010 29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations ("ASU 2010 29"), affecting public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. ASU 2010 29 specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, it should disclose revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the year had occurred at the beginning of the prior annual reporting period when preparing the pro forma financial information 63 Table of Contents for both the current and prior reporting periods. The guidance, which is effective for business combinations consummated in reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010, also requires that pro forma disclosures be accompanied by a narrative description regarding the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination(s) included in reported pro forma revenues and earnings. We have presented supplementary pro forma information related to our acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets and working capital of ASLG in May 2011 and our acquisition of NHP in July 2011 in "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010 06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ("ASU 2010 06"), which expands required disclosures related to an entitys fair value measurements. Certain provisions of ASU 2010 06 were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, and we adopted those provisions as of January 1, 2010. The remaining provisions, which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010, require additional disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in an entitys reconciliation of recurring level three investments. We adopted those provisions of ASU 2010 06 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010 06 did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations As of December 31, 2011, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple net leased properties, senior living operations and MOB operations. Our triple net leased properties segment consists of acquiring and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States and leasing those properties to healthcare operating companies under "triple net" or "absolute net" leases that require the tenants to pay all property related expenses. Our senior living operations segment primarily consists of investments in seniors housing communities located in the United States and Canada for which we engage independent third parties, such as Atria and Sunrise, to manage the operations. Our MOB operations segment primarily consists of acquiring, owning, developing, leasing and managing MOBs. Information provided for "all other" includes revenues such as income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate level expenses not directly attributable to our three reportable business segments. Assets included in all other consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, deferred financing costs, loans receivable and miscellaneous accounts receivable. 64 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 The table below shows our results of operations for each year and the effect on our income of changes in those results from year to year. For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI: Triple Net Leased Properties $ 654,794 $ 461,709 $ 193,085 41.8 % Senior Living Operations 279,331 154,470 124,861 80.8 MOB Operations 116,591 50,205 66,386 &gt;100 All Other 34,415 16,412 18,003 &gt;100 Total segment NOI 1,085,131 682,796 402,335 58.9 Interest and other income 1,217 484 733 &gt;100 Interest expense (236,807 ) (175,631 ) (61,176 ) (34.8 ) Depreciation and amortization (456,590 ) (203,762 ) (252,828 ) (&gt;100 ) General, administrative and professional fees (74,537 ) (49,830 ) (24,707 ) (49.6 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (27,604 ) (9,791 ) (17,813 ) (&gt;100 ) Litigation proceeds, net 202,259 202,259 nm Merger related expenses and deal costs (153,923 ) (19,243 ) (134,680 ) (&gt;100 ) Other (8,653 ) (272 ) (8,381 ) (&gt;100 ) Income before loss from unconsolidated entities, income taxes, discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest 330,493 224,751 105,742 47.0 Loss from unconsolidated entities (52 ) (664 ) 612 92.2 Income tax benefit (expense) 31,137 (5,201 ) 36,338 (&gt;100 ) Income from continuing operations 361,578 218,886 142,692 65.2 Discontinued operations 1,683 30,843 (29,160 ) (94.5 ) Net income 363,261 249,729 113,532 45.5 Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax (1,232 ) 3,562 4,794 (&gt;100 ) Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 364,493 $ 246,167 $ 118,326 48.1 % nm notmeaningful Segment NOI Triple Net Leased Properties NOI for our triple net leased properties reportable business segment consists of rental income earned from our triple net assets and other services revenue. We incur no direct operating expenses for this segment. Triple net leased properties segment NOI increased primarily due to $179.2 million of rental income from the properties we acquired in connection with the NHP acquisition, $6.0 million of additional rent resulting from the annual escalators in the rent paid under the Kindred Master Leases effective May 1, 2011, other services revenue directly attributable to the NHP acquisition ($2.2 million) and various rent increases at our other existing triple net leased properties. 65  Table of Contents In our triple net leased properties segment, revenues consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual escalations) received directly from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms and generally do not depend on the operating performance of our properties. Accordingly, occupancy information is relevant to the profitability of our tenants operations but does not directly impact our revenues or financial results. The following table sets forth average occupancy rates related to the triple net leased properties we owned at December 31, 2011 for the third quarter of 2011, which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants. Number of Properties at December 31, 2011 Average Occupancy For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2011 Seniors Housing Communities 458 86.0 % Skilled Nursing Facilities 382 83.6 % Hospitals 47 56.3 % Segment NOI Senior Living Operations The following table summarizes our senior living operations reportable business segment NOI: For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI Senior Living Operations: Total revenues $ 873,308 $ 446,301 $ 427,007 95.7 % Less: Property level operating expenses (593,977 ) (291,831 ) (302,146 ) &gt;100 Segment NOI $ 279,331 $ 154,470 $ 124,861 80.8 % In our senior living operations segment, revenues consist of resident fees and services, which include all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Our senior living operations segment revenues increased primarily due to the properties we acquired in connection with the ASLG acquisition ($403.2 million) and an increase in average daily rates. The following table sets forth average resident occupancy rates related to our senior living operating properties during 2011 and 2010: Number of Properties at December 31, Average Occupancy For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2011(1) 2010 Stabilized Communities 188 80 89.2 % 89.1 % Lease Up Communities 12 2 78.7 % 84.3 % Total 200 82 88.6 % 88.9 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 79 79 90.0 % 89.2 % (1)Occupancy related to the seniors housing communities acquired in connection with the ASLG acquisition reflects activity from May 12, 2011, the date of the acquisition, through December 31, 2011. 66 Table of Contents Property level operating expenses related to the segment include labor, food, utility, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. Property level operating expenses increased in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to the properties we acquired in connection with the ASLG acquisition ($281.1 million) and the receipt of a $5 million cash payment from Sunrise in 2010 for expense overages. Segment NOI MOB Operations The following table summarizes our MOB operations reportable business segment NOI: For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI MOB Operations: Rental income $ 167,003 $ 69,747 $ 97,256 &gt;100 % Medical office building services revenue 34,254 14,098 20,156 &gt;100 Total revenues 201,257 83,845 117,412 &gt;100 Less: Property level operating expenses (57,584 ) (24,122 ) (33,462 ) (&gt;100 ) Medical office building services costs (27,082 ) (9,518 ) (17,564 ) (&gt;100 ) Segment NOI $ 116,591 $ 50,205 $ 66,386 &gt;100 % nm notmeaningful The increases in MOB operations segment revenues and property level operating expenses are attributed primarily to the MOBs we acquired in connection with the NHP acquisition ($68.6 million) and a full of year of activity related to the MOBs we acquired in 2010 in connection with the Lillibridge acquisition. The following table sets forth occupancy rates related to our MOB operations segment at December 31, 2011 and 2010: Number of Properties at December 31, Occupancy at December 31, 2011 2010 2011 2010 Stabilized MOBs 177 63 91.9 % 94.8 % Non Stabilized MOBs 14 6 73.3 % 73.9 % Total 191 69 89.5 % 91.5 % Same Store Stabilized MOBs 63 63 94.0 % 94.7 % Medical office building services revenue and costs, which are a direct result of the Lillibridge businesses that we acquired in July 2010, both increased due primarily due to a full year of activity in 2011 and increased construction activity during the second half of 2011 compared to 2010. Segment NOI All Other All other NOI consists solely of income from loans and investments. Income from loans and investments increased in 2011 over the prior year primarily due to the loans receivable we acquired in connection with the NHP acquisition, gains from the sale of marketable debt securities and additional investments we made in loans receivable during 2010 and 2011, partially offset by decreased interest income related to loans receivable repayments we received during 2011. 67 Table of Contents Interest Expense The $62.1 million increase in total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $5.3 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is attributed primarily to a $117.6 million increase in interest due to higher loan balances and $7.7 million of interest related to the capital leases we assumed in our 2011 acquisitions, partially offset by a $65.1 million decrease in interest due to lower effective interest rates, including the amortization of any fair value adjustments. Our effective interest rate, excluding activity related to our capital leases, was 4.9% for 2011, compared to 6.4% for 2010. A decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on interest expense of $0.2 million for 2011, versus 2010. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the NHP and ASLG acquisitions and other properties we acquired in 2011. General, Administrative and Professional Fees General, administrative and professional fees increased in 2011 primarily due to our organizational growth. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2011 resulted from our early repayment in February 2011 of $307.2 million principal amount of existing mortgage debt, our redemption in July 2011 of $200.0 million principal amount of our 61/2% senior notes due 2016 and our termination in October 2011 of our previous unsecured revolving credit facilities. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 resulted from our redemption in June 2010 of all $142.7 million principal amount outstanding of our 71/8% senior notes due 2015, our redemption in October 2010 of all $71.7 million principal amount outstanding of our 65/8% senior notes due 2014 and various mortgage debt repayments in December 2010. Litigation Proceeds, Net Litigation proceeds, net in 2011 reflects our receipt of $102.8 million in payment of the compensatory damages award from HCP arising out of our 2007 Sunrise REIT acquisition, plus certain costs and interest, and the receipt of an additional $125 million from HCP in final settlement of our outstanding lawsuit against HCP, net of certain fees and expenses, the contingent fee for our outside legal counsel and donations to the Ventas Charitable Foundation. No similar events occurred during 2010. Merger Related Expenses and Deal Costs Merger related expenses and deal costs in both years consisted of expenses relating to our favorable $101.6 million compensatory damages judgment against HCP and subsequent cross appeals, transition and integration expenses related to consummated transactions and deal costs required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value. The transition and integration expenses and deal costs reflect certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Lillibridge, ASLG and NHP acquisitions. 68 Table of Contents Other Other consists primarily of the fair value adjustment on interest rate swaps we acquired in connection with the ASLG and NHP acquisitions, partially offset by other expenses. Loss from Unconsolidated Entities Loss from unconsolidated entities for 2011 and 2010 relates to the noncontrolling interests in joint ventures we acquired in connection with the NHP and Lillibridge acquisitions. At December 31, 2011, these noncontrolling interests ranged between 5% and 25% and related to 58 MOBs, 20 seniors housing communities and fourteen skilled nursing facilities. Income Tax Benefit/Expense Income tax benefit for 2011 was due primarily to the reversal of certain income tax contingency reserves, including interest, related to our 2007 U.S. federal income tax returns and the deferred tax liabilities established in connection with the ASLG acquisition. Income tax expense for 2010 represents amounts related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a result of the Sunrise REIT acquisition. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations for 2011 includes activity related to nineteen properties, four of which were sold during 2011 with no resulting gain or loss and fifteen of which were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011. Discontinued operations for 2010 includes activity related to nine of the nineteen properties mentioned above that we owned during 2010, a $17.3 million gain on the sale of seven assets sold during 2010, lease termination fees of $0.7 million related to these assets and a $7.9 million previously deferred gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 upon repayment of a note to the buyer. Net Loss/Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2011 represents our partners joint venture interests in 29 MOBs and seniors housing communities, 23 of which we acquired in connection with the NHP acquisition. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax for 2010 represents Sunrises share of net income from its previous ownership interests in 60 of our seniors housing communities, which we acquired during 2010, and our partners joint venture interests in six MOBs. 69 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 The table below shows our results of operations for each year and the effect on our income of changes in those results from year to year.

The following table sets forth average resident occupancy rates related to our senior living operating properties during 2010 and 2009: Number of Properties at December 31, Average Occupancy For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Stabilized Communities 80 78 89.1 % 88.3 % Lease Up Communities 2 1 84.3 % 70.4 % Total 82 79 88.9 % 87.7 % Same Store Stabilized Communities 78 78 89.1 % 88.3 % Property level operating expenses increased primarily as a result of a decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate, which had an unfavorable impact of $5.4 million in 2010, $3.1 million of additional expenses from the three seniors housing communities we acquired in 2010 and late 2009 and increased expenses related to occupancy and revenue growth, partially offset by the receipt of a $5 million cash payment from Sunrise in 2010 for expense overages and a decrease of $4.2 million in management fees. 71 Table of Contents Segment NOI MOB Operations The following table summarizes our MOB operations reportable business segment NOI: For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Segment NOI MOB Operations: Rental income $ 69,747 $ 35,922 $ 33,825 94.2 % Medical office building services revenue 14,098 14,098 nm Total revenues 83,845 35,922 47,923 &gt;100 Less: Property level operating expenses (24,122 ) (12,768 ) (11,354 ) (88.9 ) Medical office building services costs (9,518 ) (9,518 ) nm Segment NOI $ 50,205 $ 23,154 $ 27,051 &gt;100 % nm notmeaningful The increases in MOB operations segment revenues and property level operating expenses are attributed primarily to the MOBs we acquired during 2010 and 2009, including the Lillibridge portfolio. The following table sets forth occupancy rates related to our MOB operations segment at December 31, 2010 and 2009: Number of Properties at December 31, Occupancy at December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 Stabilized MOBs 63 21 94.8 % 94.9 % Non Stabilized MOBs 6 5 73.9 % 73.9 % Total 69 26 91.5 % 89.6 % Same Store Stabilized MOBs 18 18 93.2 % 93.9 % Segment NOI All Other All other NOI consists solely of income from loans and investments. Income from loans and investments increased in 2010 over the prior year primarily due to interest earned on the investments we made during 2010 and 2009. Interest Expense The $0.2 million increase in total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $4.3 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is due primarily to increased deferred financing fee amortization, increased land lease payments and a $0.4 million increase in interest from higher effective interest rates, partially offset by a $2.7 million reduction in interest from lower loan balances. Interest expense includes $9.0 million and $7.4 million of amortized deferred financing fees for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective interest rate was 6.4% for 2010, compared to 6.3% for 2009. A decrease in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate had an unfavorable impact on interest expense of $0.7 million in 2010, compared to 2009. 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the properties we acquired or developed during 2010 and 2009, including the Lillibridge portfolio. General, Administrative and Professional Fees General, administrative and professional fees increased $11.0 million in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to our organizational growth as a result of the Lillibridge acquisition. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2010 relates primarily to our redemption in June 2010 of all $142.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 71/8% senior notes due 2015, our redemption in October 2010 of all $71.7 million principal amount then outstanding of our 65/8% senior notes due 2014 and various mortgage repayments in December 2010. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2009 primarily relates to the purchase, in open market transactions and or through cash tender offers, of $361.6 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes. Merger Related Expenses and Deal Costs Merger related expenses and deal costs consisted of expenses relating to our favorable $101.6 million jury verdict against HCP and subsequent cross appeals arising out of our Sunrise REIT acquisition, integration costs related to consummated transactions and deal costs required by GAAP to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value, which include certain fees and expenses we incurred in connection with the Lillibridge and ASLG acquisitions. Other Other in 2010 resulted primarily from the net change in our forward contract valuation compared to the revaluation of intercompany loans, partially offset by the Canadian exchange rate differential between the trade date and settlement date on a cash payment. Loss from Unconsolidated Entities Loss from unconsolidated entities in 2010 relates to the noncontrolling interests in joint ventures we acquired as part of the Lillibridge acquisition. At December 31, 2010, we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 20% in 58 MOBs. See "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Income Tax Expense/Benefit Income tax expense/benefit before noncontrolling interest in 2010 and 2009 represents amounts related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries as a result of the Sunrise REIT and Lillibridge acquisitions. The change from an income tax benefit in 2009 to a non cash income tax expense in 2010 is primarily due to increased NOI at our Sunrise managed seniors housing communities. See "Note 13 Income Taxes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations for 2010 includes a $17.3 million gain on the sale of seven assets sold during 2010, lease termination fees of $0.7 million related to these assets and a $7.9 million previously deferred gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 upon repayment of a note to the buyer. 73 Table of Contents Discontinued operations for 2009 includes a $66.8 million net gain on the sale of fourteen assets sold during 2009 and a lease termination fee of $2.3 million related to these assets. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax primarily represents Sunrises share of net income from its previous ownership percentage in 60 of our seniors housing communities during 2009 and 58 of our seniors housing communities during most of 2010. Non GAAP Financial Measures We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, we consider certain non GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure. Set forth below are descriptions of the non GAAP financial measures we consider most relevant to our business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non GAAP financial measures we present herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values, instead, have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. To overcome this problem, we consider Funds From Operations ("FFO") and normalized FFO appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that normalized FFO provides useful information because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events such as transactions and litigation. We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) gains and losses on the sales of real property assets; (b) merger related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles and transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to our lawsuit against HCP and the issuance of preferred stock or bridge loan fees; (c) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make whole payments, 74 Table of Contents penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) the non cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; (e) the impact of future unannounced acquisitions or divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and capital transactions; (f) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (g) charitable donations made to the Ventas Charitable Foundation; and (h) gains and losses for non operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments. Our FFO and normalized FFO for the five years ended December 31, 2011 are summarized in the following table. Our FFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased over the prior year primarily due to the NHP and ASLG acquisitions, higher NOI from our senior living operations and MOB operations reportable business segments, net litigation proceeds and income tax benefit, partially offset by increased merger related expenses and deal costs, general, administrative and professional fees and interest expense due to our enterprise growth.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non cash stock based compensation expense), excluding loss on extinguishment of debt, net litigation proceeds, merger related expenses and deal costs, gains or losses on sales of real property assets and changes in the fair value of financial instruments (including amounts in discontinued operations).

The objective of asset/liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategy, while maintaining appropriate risk levels. Our asset/liability management process focuses on a variety of risks, including without limitation market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $500 million term loan facility, floating rate mortgage debt and certain mortgage loans receivable. These market risks result primarily from changes in LIBOR or prime rates. We continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of the current and future economic environment. 77 Table of Contents The table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums, discounts and capital lease obligations. As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other $ 2,460,026 $ 1,537,433 $ 1,153,131 Mortgage loans and other(1) 2,357,268 1,234,263 1,324,094 Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 455,578 40,000 8,466 Unsecured term loan facility 501,875 Mortgage loans and other(1) 405,696 115,258 215,970 Total $ 6,180,443 $ 2,926,954 $ 2,701,661 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other 39.8 % 52.5 % 42.7 % Mortgage loans and other(1) 38.1 % 42.2 % 49.0 % Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 7.4 % 1.4 % 0.3 % Unsecured term loan facility 8.1 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Mortgage loans and other(1) 6.6 % 3.9 % 8.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate: Senior notes and other 5.3 % 5.1 % 6.3 % Mortgage loans and other(1) 6.1 % 6.2 % 6.3 % Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facilities 1.4 % 3.1 % 3.1 % Unsecured term loan facility 1.8 % N/A N/A Mortgage loans and other(1) 2.0 % 1.5 % 2.0 % Total 4.8 % 5.4 % 6.0 % (1)The amounts presented above exclude debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2011. The total mortgage debt for these properties as of December 31, 2011 was $14.6 million. The variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $167.6 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with a maturity of February 1, 2013 that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to debt assumed in connection with the ASLG and NHP acquisitions, borrowings under our variable rate term loan facility and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain variable rate debt that we have totaling $80.0 million as of December 31, 2011, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar for dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. Therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt (excluding debt related to real estate assets classified as held for sale at December 31, 2011), and 78 Table of Contents assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011, interest expense for 2012 would increase, and our net income would decrease, by approximately $13.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share. The fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. For fixed rate debt, interest rate fluctuations generally affect the fair value, but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. Therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until such obligations mature or we elect to prepay and refinance them. If interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures or is refinanced, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of maturity or refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs. To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points ("BPS") in interest rates as of December 31, 2011 and 2010: As of December 31, 2011 2010 (In thousands) Gross book value $ 4,984,743 $ 2,771,695 Fair value(1) 5,439,222 2,900,143 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates:(1) 100 BPS 5,401,585 3,008,630 +100 BPS 4,963,413 2,794,140 (1)The change in fair value of our fixed rate debt was due primarily to the overall change in interest rates and the assumption of debt in connection with the ASLG and NHP acquisitions. We earn interest from investments in marketable debt securities on a fixed rate basis. We record these investments as available for sale at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair value of these investments to change. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the aggregate fair value of our marketable debt securities held at December 31, 2011, which had an aggregate original cost of $37.8 million, was $43.3 million and $43.4 million, respectively. During 2011, we sold marketable debt securities and received proceeds of approximately $23.1 million. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our secured and unsecured loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing interest rates for comparable loans, was $281.5 million. See "Note 6 Loans Receivable" and "Note 11 Fair Values of Financial Instruments" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We are subject to fluctuations in U.S. and Canadian exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our twelve seniors housing communities in Canada. Based solely on our 2011 results, if the Canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase or decrease by $0.10, our net income from these communities would decrease or increase, as applicable, by $0.1 million per year. If we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing or healthcare assets outside the United States, we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility in currencies other than U.S. or Canadian dollars. Although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives (including additional borrowings in local currencies) to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot provide any assurance that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to 79 Table of Contents service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT (a "Material Adverse Effect"). We may engage in hedging strategies to manage our exposure to market risks in the future, depending on an analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies. However, we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Concentration and Credit Risk We use concentration ratios to understand and evaluate the potential risks of economic downturns or other adverse events affecting our various asset types, geographic locations, business models, or tenants, operators and managers. We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of investment mix, which measures the portion of our investments that consists of a certain asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager, and operations mix, which measures the portion of our operating results that is attributed to a certain tenant or operator, geographic location or business model. The following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented: As of December 31, 2011 2010 Investment mix by asset type(1): Seniors housing communities 66.7 % 70.2 % Skilled nursing facilities 16.4 % 11.7 % MOBs 13.1 % 10.8 % Hospitals 2.6 % 5.0 % Loans receivable, net 1.1 % 2.2 % Other properties 0.1 % 0.1 % Investment mix by tenant, operator and manager(1): Atria 19.0 % N/A Sunrise 14.4 % 37.9 % Brookdale Senior Living 13.0 % 19.7 % Kindred 5.0 % 13.1 % All other 48.6 % 29.3 % (1)Ratios are based on the gross book value of real estate investments as of each reporting date (including assets held for sale as of December 31, 2011). 80 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Operations mix by tenant and operator and business model: Revenues(1): Senior living operations(2) 49.2 % 43.7 % 44.7 % Kindred 14.3 % 24.2 % 26.2 % Brookdale Senior Living 8.2 % 11.9 % 12.9 % All others 28.3 % 20.2 % 16.2 % Adjusted EBITDA: Senior living operations(2) 26.0 % 22.7 % 20.4 % Kindred 21.9 % 34.6 % 39.2 % Brookdale Senior Living 13.2 % 17.0 % 18.6 % All others 38.9 % 25.7 % 21.8 % NOI: Senior living operations(2) 24.3 % 22.2 % 20.6 % Kindred 23.2 % 35.6 % 38.5 % Brookdale Senior Living 13.4 % 17.3 % 19.1 % All others 39.1 % 24.9 % 21.8 % Operations mix by geographic location(3): California 13.7 % 12.0 % 12.7 % New York 8.7 % 3.5 % 3.7 % Illinois 6.4 % 10.2 % 10.3 % Massachusetts 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.3 % Texas 5.0 % 2.7 % 2.6 % All others 61.2 % 66.6 % 65.4 % (1)Total revenues include medical office building and other services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income. Revenues from properties sold or held for sale as of the reporting date are included in this presentation. (2)Amounts attributable to senior living operations managed by Atria for the year ended December 31, 2011 relate to the period from May 12, 2011, the date of the ASLG acquisition, through December 31, 2011. (3)Ratios are based on total revenues for each period presented. Total revenues includes medical office building and other services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income. Revenues from properties sold as of the reporting date are excluded from this presentation. See "Non GAAP Financial Measures" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional disclosure and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and NOI to our net income or total revenues, as applicable, as computed in accordance with GAAP. We derive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), with caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenue from individual residents at our seniors housing communities managed by independent third parties, such as Atria and Sunrise, and tenants in our MOBs. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 29.4% of our Adjusted EBITDA (including amounts in discontinued operations) 81 Table of Contents was derived from our senior living operations and MOB operations, where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions. Our reliance on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income creates credit risk. Our financial condition and results of operations could be weakened and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be limited if either Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living was unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us. In addition, any failure by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation or its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See "Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business We depend on Kindred and Brookdale Senior Living for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Any inability or unwillingness by Kindred or Brookdale Senior Living to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could have a Material Adverse Effect on us" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and "Note 3 Concentration of Credit Risk" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease and other agreements with our tenants and borrowers by, among other things, (i) reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally, publicly available information regarding tenants, and required information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements, and (ii) having periodic discussions and visits with tenants, borrowers and their representatives. Because Atria and Sunrise manage, but do not lease, our properties, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple net tenants. However, we rely on their personnel, good faith, expertise, historical performance, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information and judgment to manage our seniors housing communities efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Atria and Sunrise to set resident fees and otherwise operate those properties in compliance with the terms of our management agreements. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, Atrias or Sunrises inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties and to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. In addition, significant changes in Atrias or Sunrises senior management or any adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See "Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business The properties managed by Atria and Sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; Although Atria and Sunrise are managers, not tenants, of our properties, adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a Material Adverse Effect on us" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 82  Table of Contents Triple Net Lease Expirations We are exposed to the risk that, as our triple net leases expire, our tenants may elect not to renew those leases and, in that event, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. The following table summarizes our triple net lease expirations currently scheduled to occur over the next ten years (excluding leases related to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2011): Number of Properties 2011 Annual Rental Income % of 2011 Total Triple Net Rental Income (Dollars in thousands) 2012 10 $ 1,738 0.3 % 2013 86 103,682 15.9 2014 21 13,840 2.1 2015 173 168,231 25.8 2016 28 11,233 1.7 2017 49 11,920 1.8 2018(1) 23 25,842 4.0 2019 75 114,290 17.5 2020 113 56,586 8.7 2021 160 91,558 14.0 (1)Includes sixteen assets whose current lease term expires in 2013, but for which Kindred has provided renewal notices. In certain cases, Kindred may have the right to revoke its renewal of eight of those assets currently representing approximately $9 million of annual base rent. See "Note 3 Concentration of Credit Risk" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. The non renewal of some or all of our triple net leases could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See "Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Business If we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on us" included in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $45.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, operating cash and cash related to our senior living operations and MOB operations reportable business segments that is deposited and held in property level accounts. Funds maintained in the property level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property level expenses, debt service payments and certain capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2011, we also had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $76.6 million and $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. During 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, cash flows from operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and unsecured term loans, proceeds from our loans receivable and marketable securities portfolios, proceeds related to our litigation with HCP and cash on hand. We funded the ASLG acquisition, including deal costs, through the issuance of 24.96 million shares of our common stock, cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and assumed mortgage financing. We funded the NHP acquisition, including deal costs, through the issuance of 99.8 million shares of our common stock, cash on hand, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and the assumption of debt. 83 Table of Contents During the next twelve months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt, including our 9% senior notes due 2012 and 81/4% senior notes due 2012; (iv) fund capital expenditures for our senior living operations and our MOB operations reportable segments; (v) fund acquisitions, including our pending Cogdell transaction, investments and commitments, including development activities; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. We believe that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings, issuances of debt and equity securities, including the $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2022 that we issued in February 2012, proceeds from sales of assets and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan facility. However, if any of these sources of capital is unavailable to us or is not available at an acceptable cost or if we engage in significant acquisition or investment activity, we may seek or require additional funding from debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and or the issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities. See "Risk Factors Risks Arising from Our Capital Structure Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt payments, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We expect to fund the Cogdell transaction through borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and assumed mortgage financing. Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of Cogdells stockholders, the sale of Cogdells design build and development business and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2012, although we cannot provide any assurance as to whether or when the closing will occur. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility was $2.0 billion. Borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to a reference rate (the applicable LIBOR for Eurocurrency rate loans and the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the administrative agents prime rate and (iii) the applicable LIBOR plus 1.0% for base rate loans) plus a spread based on our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. At December 31, 2011, the applicable spread was 110 basis points for Eurocurrency rate loans and 10 basis points for base rate loans. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 15 to 45 basis points per annum (based on our senior unsecured long term debt ratings) on the aggregate revolving commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2011, the facility fee was 17.5 basis points. Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in October 2015, but may be extended for one year at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Under the terms of the unsecured revolving credit facility, our aggregate borrowing capacity may be increased to up to $2.5 billion at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The agreement governing our unsecured revolving credit facility subjects us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. See "Note 10 Borrowing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under an unsecured term loan that matures in September 2013. The term loan is non amortizing and bears interest at an all in fixed rate of 4% per annum. We may prepay the term loan at any time on or after September 27, 2012 without penalty or at any time on or after March 27, 2012 and prior to September 27, 2012 with a make whole payment. 84 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we also had $500.0 million of borrowings outstanding under an unsecured term loan facility with a weighted average maturity of 4.5 years. Borrowings under the term loan facility bear interest at the applicable LIBOR plus a spread based on our senior unsecured long term debt ratings (125 basis points at December 31, 2011). The term loan facility is comprised of a three year tranche and a five year tranche and contains an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to $900.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Upon entering into the term loan facility, we terminated the commitments under an $800.0 million term loan previously extended to NHP and assumed by us in connection with the NHP acquisition that was scheduled to mature in June 2012. Borrowings under the NHP term loan bore interest at the applicable LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the "Alternate Base Rate" plus 0.50%, and the NHP term loan had a 10 basis point per annum facility fee. Convertible Senior Notes In November 2011, we repaid in full $230.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 37/8% convertible senior notes due 2011 upon maturity. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes, we paid the principal amount of the notes and accrued but unpaid interest thereon in cash and issued an aggregate of 943,714 shares of our common stock in settlement of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. Senior Notes and Other As of December 31, 2011, the following series of senior notes issued by our subsidiaries, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership and Ventas Capital Corporation (collectively, the "Ventas Issuers"), were outstanding: $82.4 million principal amount of 9% senior notes due 2012; $400.0 million principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015; $200.0 million principal amount of 61/2% senior notes due 2016; $225.0 million principal amount of 63/4% senior notes due 2017; and $700.0 million principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2021. In connection with the NHP acquisition, our subsidiary, Nationwide Health Properties, LLC ("NHP LLC"), assumed $991.6 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured senior notes of NHP. In July 2011, we repaid in full, at par, $339.0 million principal amount then outstanding of NHP LLCs 6.50% senior notes due 2011 upon maturity. As of December 31, 2011, the following series of senior notes of NHP LLC were outstanding: $73.0 million principal amount of 81/4% senior notes due 2012; $270.0 million principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due 2013; $234.4 million principal amount of 6% senior notes due 2015; $52.4 million principal amount of 6.90% senior notes due 2037 (subject to earlier repayment at the option of the holder); and $23.0 million principal amount of 6.59% senior notes due 2038 (subject to earlier repayment at the option of the holder). In February 2012, we issued and sold $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2022, at a public offering price equal to 99.214% of par for total proceeds of $595.3 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. 85 Table of Contents Also in February 2012, we exercised our option to redeem all $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of the Ventas Issuers 61/2% senior notes due 2016 pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the notes. We will pay a total of $206.5 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and expect to recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2012. In July 2011, we redeemed $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of the Ventas Issuers 61/2% senior notes due 2016, at a redemption price equal to 103.25% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $206.5 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.7 million during the third quarter of 2011. In May 2011, we issued and sold $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2021, at a public offering price equal to 99.132% of par, for total proceeds of $693.9 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. In November 2010, we issued and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2015, at a public offering price equal to 99.528% of par, for total proceeds of $398.1 million, before the underwriting discount and expenses. In October 2010, we redeemed all $71.7 million principal amount outstanding of the Ventas Issuers 65/8% senior notes due 2014, at a redemption price equal to 102.21% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $73.3 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2010. In September 2010, the subsidiary guarantees on the Ventas Issuers then outstanding senior notes (other than the 9% senior notes due 2012) were released pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the notes. In June 2010, we redeemed all $142.7 million principal amount outstanding of the Ventas Issuers 71/8% senior notes due 2015, at a redemption price equal to 103.56% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, pursuant to the call option contained in the indenture governing the notes. As a result, we paid a total of $147.8 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the redemption date and recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million during the second quarter of 2010. In May 2010, we repaid in full, at par, $1.4 million principal amount then outstanding of the Ventas Issuers 63/4% senior notes due 2010 upon maturity. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding senior notes for cash and or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. However, at any time we maintain investment grade ratings by both Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Ratings Services, the indentures governing the Ventas Issuers senior notes due 2012, 2016 and 2017 provide that certain of these restrictive covenants will either be suspended or fall away. See "Note 10 Borrowing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2011. 86 Table of Contents Mortgage Loan Obligations Our share of facility level mortgage debt outstanding was $2.7 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the consolidated aggregate principal amount was $2.8 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, we assumed mortgage debt of $1.6 billion, including $1.2 billion and $442 million, respectively, in connection with the ASLG and NHP acquisitions. See "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In February 2011, we repaid in full mortgage loans outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $307.2 million and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.5 million in connection with these repayments in the first quarter of 2011. During 2010, we assumed $79.5 million of mortgage debt in connection with our acquisition of Lillibridge and its related entities. See "Note 4 Acquisitions of Real Estate Property" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In June 2010, we repaid $49.8 million of mortgage loans on two of our Sunrise managed properties in which, at that time, we had 80% ownership interests. In connection with our payment of Sunrises share ($9.9 million) of those mortgage loans, we acquired Sunrises 20% noncontrolling interests in the properties. Dividends In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). In 2011, our Board of Directors declared and we paid cash dividends aggregating $2.30 per share, which exceeds 100% of our 2011 estimated taxable income after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards. We also intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2012. On February 15, 2012, our Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2012 dividend of $0.62 per share, payable in cash on March 29, 2012 to holders of record on March 9, 2012. We expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flows due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income. Although we do not anticipate any inability to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing. See "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations Requirements for Qualification as a REIT Annual Distribution Requirements" included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Capital Expenditures The terms of our triple net leases generally obligate our tenants to maintain and improve our triple net leased properties. Accordingly, we do not expect to incur any major capital expenditures in connection with these properties. From time to time, however, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple net leased properties through loans to the tenants or advances, some of which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties. After the terms of the triple net leases expire, or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under 87 Table of Contents those leases, we would expect to fund any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible with cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings. With respect to our senior living operations and MOB operations reportable business segments, we expect that capital expenditures will be funded by the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. To the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness. As a result of the NHP acquisition, we assumed certain obligations under agreements to develop seniors housing and MOB properties. The construction of these properties is funded through capital provided by us and, in some circumstances, other joint venture members. As of December 31, 2011, one seniors housing community and two MOBs were in various stages of development pursuant to our agreements. We have funded $45.0 million through December 31, 2011 toward these development projects, and our total commitment to these projects is estimated to be between $90 million and $100 million over the development period. Equity Offerings and Related Events In November 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement relating to our Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRIP"), under which existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash distribution on their shares of our common stock, subject to certain limits. In November 2011, we repaid in full $230.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 37/8% convertible senior notes due 2011 upon maturity. In accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the convertible notes, we paid the principal amount of the notes and accrued but unpaid interest thereon in cash and issued an aggregate of 943,714 shares of our common stock in settlement of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In July 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of up to 2,103,086 shares of our common stock that we may issue upon redemption of the Class A limited partnership units in NHP/PMB L.P. See "Note 2 Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. In July 2011, following approval by our stockholders, we amended our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as previously amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of our capital stock to 610,000,000, comprised of 600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share. In May 2011, we filed a shelf registration statement relating to the resale by the selling stockholders of the shares of our common stock issued as partial consideration for the ASLG acquisition. In January 2012, the selling stockholders completed an underwritten public offering of 21,070,658 shares of our common stock pursuant to the resale shelf registration statement. We did not receive any proceeds from the offering. In February 2011, we completed the sale of 5,563,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering pursuant to our shelf registration statement for $300.0 million in aggregate proceeds. In March 2010, we filed a shelf registration statement relating to the resale, from time to time, by the selling stockholders of shares of our common stock issued upon conversion of our 37/8% convertible senior notes due 2011. 88 Table of Contents Other We received proceeds of $1.8 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options. Future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be primarily affected by the future trading price of our common stock and the number of options outstanding. Options outstanding (excluding options we assumed in connection with the NHP acquisition) increased to 2.0 million as of December 31, 2011, from 1.7 million as of December 31, 2010. The weighted average exercise price was $42.10 as of December 31, 2011. We issued approximately 13,500 and 41,600 shares of common stock under the DRIP for net proceeds of $0.6 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We currently offer a 1% discount on the purchase price of our stock to shareholders who reinvest their dividends and or make optional cash purchases of common stock through the plan. Each month or quarter, as applicable, we may lower or eliminate the discount without prior notice, thereby affecting the future proceeds that we receive from this plan. Cash Flows The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: For the Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) to Cash 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 21,812 $ 107,397 $ (85,585 ) (79.7 )% Net cash provided by operating activities 773,197 447,622 325,575 72.7 Net cash used in investing activities (997,439 ) (301,920 ) (695,519 ) &gt;100 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 248,282 (231,452 ) 479,734 (&gt;100 ) Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents (45 ) 165 (210 ) (&gt;100 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 45,807 $ 21,812 $ 23,995 &gt;100 % Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities increased in 2011 primarily due to the NHP and ASLG acquisitions, higher NOI from our senior living operations and MOB operations reportable business segments and proceeds related to our litigation with HCP, partially offset by increased merger related expenses and deal costs, general, administrative and professional fees and deal costs and interest expense all due to our enterprise growth. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2011 and 2010 consisted primarily of cash paid for our investments in real estate ($531.6 million and $274.4 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively), investments in loans receivable ($628.1 million and $38.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively), capital expenditures ($50.5 million and $18.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively), development project expenditures ($47.6 million and $1.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively), and the purchase of noncontrolling interests ($3.3 million and $42.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively). The increase in capital expenditures and development project expenditures is the direct result of the growth in our senior living and MOB operations reportable business segments. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from loans receivable ($220.2 million and $19.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively), 89 Table of Contents proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities ($23.1 million in 2011), and proceeds from real estate disposals ($20.6 million and $58.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively). Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during 2011 consisted primarily of $537.5 million of net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, $1.3 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of debt and $299.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by $1.4 billion of debt repayments, $526.0 million of cash dividend and distribution payments to common stockholders, unitholders and noncontrolling interest parties and $20.0 million of payments for deferred financing costs. Cash used in financing activities during 2010 consisted primarily of $524.8 million of debt repayments, $344.2 million of cash dividend and distribution payments to common stockholders and noncontrolling interest parties and $2.7 million of payments for deferred financing costs. These uses were partially offset by $597.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and $28.6 million of net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the effect that minimum debt (which includes principal and interest payments) and other material noncancelable commitments are expected to have on our cash flow in future periods as of December 31, 2011: Total Less than 1 year(5) 1 3 years(6) 3 5 years(7) More than 5 years(8) (In thousands) Long term debt obligations(1)(2)(3) $ 7,961,489 $ 613,231 $ 1,742,243 $ 2,397,133 $ 3,208,882 Capital lease obligations 211,097 9,446 19,272 19,779 162,600 Acquisition commitments(4) 495,000 495,000 Operating obligations, including ground lease obligations 400,421 17,620 32,346 27,960 322,495 Total $ 9,068,007 $ 1,135,297 $ 1,793,861 $ 2,444,872 $ 3,693,977 (1)Amounts represent contractual amounts due, including interest.
