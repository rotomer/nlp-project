Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview Verizon Communications Inc. is one of the worlds leading providers of communications services. Verizon companies are the largest providers of wireline and wireless communications in the United States, with 132.1 million access line equivalents and 29.4 million wireless customers. Verizon is also the largest directory publisher in the world. A Fortune 10 company with more than $67 billion in annual revenues and approximately 247,000 employees, Verizons global presence extends to more than 40 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific. We have four reportable segments, which we operate and manage as strategic business units: Domestic Telecom, Domestic Wireless, International and Information Services. Domestic Telecom includes local, long distance and other telecommunication services. Domestic Wireless products and services include wireless voice and data services, paging services and equipment sales. International operations include wireline and wireless communications operations, investments and management contracts in the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Information Services publishes domestic and international print and electronic directories and Internet based shopping guides, as well as includes website creation and other electronic commerce services. Critical Accounting Policies: Significant accounting policies are highlighted in the applicable sections of this Managements Discussion and Analysis (see "Special Items," "Severance/Retirement Enhancement Costs and Settlement Gains," "Loss/(Gain) on Securities" and "Genuity Loss"). In addition, all of our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. A summary of these critical accounting policies follows: ... Special items generally represent revenues and gains as well as expenses and losses that are nonrecurring and or non operational in nature. Several of these special items include impairment losses. These impairment losses were determined in accordance with our policy of comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. The fair value is determined by quoted market prices or by estimates of future cash flows. There is inherent subjectivity involved in estimating future cash flows, which impacts the amount of any impairment. ... We continually evaluate our investments in securities for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary. That evaluation includes, in addition to persistent, declining stock prices, general economic and company specific evaluations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other than temporary, a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Given our significant investments in securities, other than temporary declines in market values can have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. ... We maintain defined benefit pension plans for most of our employees. In the aggregate, the fair value of plan assets of those plans exceeds benefit obligations, which contributes to pension plan income. Significant pension plan assumptions, including the discount rate used, the long term rate of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation are periodically updated and impact the amount of pension plan income, assets and obligations. ... Our accounting policy concerning the method of accounting applied to investments (consolidation, equity or cost) involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the entity in which we have invested. Where control is determined, we consolidate the investment. If we determine that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an entity in which we have invested, we apply the equity method. We apply the cost method in situations where we determine that we do not have significant influence. Consolidated Results of Operations In this section, we discuss our overall reported results and highlight special and nonrecurring items. In the following section, we review the performance of our segments. We adjust the segments reported results for the effects of special items, which management does not consider in assessing segment performance due primarily to their nonrecurring and or non operational nature. We believe that this presentation will assist readers in better understanding operating results and trends from period to period. Reported consolidated revenues were $67,190 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $64,707 million and $58,194 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Reported consolidated operating expenses were $55,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $47,949 million and $42,241 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Reported consolidated revenues and expenses were not adjusted for prior year sales of wireline operations and the deconsolidation of Genuity Inc. (Genuity). In addition, prior year revenues included the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture beginning in April 2000 and included overlapping wireless properties through June 30, 2000. We reported net income available to common shareowners of $389 million, or $.14 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to net income available to common shareowners of $11,787 million, or $4.31 diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2000. In 1999, we reported net income available to common shareowners of $8,260 million, or $2.97 diluted earnings per share. Reported consolidated revenues grew by $2,483 million, or 3.8% in 2001 compared to 2000, and 2000 reported consolidated revenues were $6,513 million, or 11.2% higher than 1999. Reported consolidated operating expenses were $7,709 million, or 16.1% higher than 2000, and 2000 reported consolidated operating expenses exceeded 1999 by $5,708 million, or 13.5%. In 2001, higher Domestic Wireless, International and Information Services revenues were partially offset by lower Domestic Telecom revenues, and higher Domestic Wireless and International operating expenses in 2001 were partially offset by slightly lower Information Services operating expenses. In 2000, higher revenues and operating expenses were reported in all segments (see summary below and "Segment Results of Operations"). In addition, merger transition costs, severance and retirement enhancement costs and other special items increased operating expenses in 2001, while merger related costs and other special items were more than offset by gains on sales of assets, net and pension settlement gains in 2000 and 1999. Also, as stated above, comparisons of revenues and operating expenses are impacted by the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture in April 2000, the sales of non strategic wireline and other operations in 2000 and 1999 and the deconsolidation of Genuity on June 30, 2000 (see summary below and "Special Items"). The significant items impacting net income are also summarized below and described in the "Segment Results of Operations" and "Special Items" sections. Consolidated Revenues 2001 Compared to 2000 Revenues earned by Domestic Wireless in 2001 grew by $3,157 million, or 22.2% compared to 2000. By including the revenues of the properties of the Verizon Wireless joint venture and excluding the impact of wireless overlap properties in 2000 on a basis comparable with 2001, revenues were $2,030 million, or 13.2%, higher than 2000. On this comparable basis, revenue growth was largely attributable to customer additions and slightly higher revenue per customer per month. Our domestic wireless customer base grew to 29.4 million customers in 2001, compared to 26.8 million customers in 2000, an increase of nearly 10%. Revenues earned by International grew by $361 million, or 18.3% in 2001, primarily due to an increase in wireless revenues resulting from an increase in wireless subscribers of consolidated subsidiaries. Revenues from our Information Services segment increased $169 million, or 4.1%, in 2001. This increase was due primarily to growth in directory advertising revenues and extension revenues, continued growth of our Internet directory service, SuperPages.com(R), and increased revenue from a 2001 acquisition. Domestic Telecom ended 2001 with a decline in revenues of $265 million, or 0.6% compared to 2000. In 2001, local service revenues declined $115 million, or 0.5% due to the effects of lower demand and usage of our basic local wireline services and mandated intrastate price reductions. Our network access revenues grew $237 million, or 1.8% in 2001 due mainly to higher customer demand, primarily for special access services (including digital subscriber lines). Long distance service revenues declined $45 million, or 1.4% in 2001 primarily due to competition and the effects of toll calling discount packages and product bundling offers of our intraLATA toll services, largely offset by revenue growth from our interLATA long distance services. Revenues from other services declined $342 million, or 6.8% in 2001 principally as a result of lower sales of customer premises equipment, a decline in public telephone revenues as more customers substituted wireless communications for pay telephone services, and lower billing and collection revenues reflecting the take back of these services by interexchange carriers. The revenues associated with operations sold in 2000, including the wireline access lines, as well as Genuitys revenues reported prior to the deconsolidation of Genuity on June 30, 2000 and other special items represented a reduction of consolidated revenues in 2001 of $1,284 million. 2000 Compared to 1999 Domestic Telecoms revenues increased by $1,620 million in 2000, or 3.9% compared to 1999. In 2000, growth in local service revenues of $1,300 million, or 6.3% was driven by higher interconnection revenues from competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) and higher usage of our network facilities. Our network access revenues grew $315 million, or 2.5% in 2000 as a result of higher customer demand, primarily for special access services (including digital subscriber lines). Long distance service revenues declined $31 million, or 1.0% in 2000 primarily due to competition and the effects of toll calling discount packages and product bundling offers of our intraLATA toll services, largely offset by revenue growth from our interLATA long distance services. Revenues from other services grew $36 million, or 0.7%, in 2000 primarily due to higher demand for such services as systems integration and data solutions and inventory management and purchasing services, principally due to new contracts with business customers. Domestic Wireless revenues for 2000 were $6,583 million, or 86.0% higher than 1999. By including the revenues of the properties of the Verizon Wireless joint venture in 1999 on a basis comparable with 2000, revenues were $2,300 million, or 19.3%, higher than 1999. The revenue growth was due to the growth in the customer base and stable revenue per customer per month. Revenues earned by International grew by $262 million, or 15.3% in 2000, primarily due to an increase in wireless revenues driven by an increase in wireless subscribers of consolidated subsidiaries. Revenues from our Information Services segment improved by $58 million, or 1.4%, in 2000 primarily as result of growth in print directory advertising revenue and expansion of our Internet directory service, SuperPages.com(R). The revenues associated with operations sold in 2000 and 1999, including GTE Government Systems and the wireline access lines, as well as a full year of Genuitys revenues represented a reduction of consolidated revenues in 2000 of $2,011 million. Consolidated Operating Expenses 2001 Compared to 2000 Domestic Wirelesss operations and support expenses increased by $1,816 million, or 19.0% in 2001. By including the expenses of the properties of the Verizon Wireless joint venture in 2000 on a basis comparable with 2001, operations and support expenses were $1,186 million, or 11.6%, higher than 2000. Higher costs were attributable to the growth in the subscriber base as well as the continuing migration of analog customers to digital. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $815 million, or 28.2% in 2001. Adjusting for the joint venture in a manner similar to operations and support expenses above, depreciation and amortization was $336 million, or 10.0%, higher than 2000. Capital expenditures for our cellular network have increased in 2001 to support increased demand in all markets. Operations and support expenses of International increased by $263 million, or 19.4% in 2001. The higher costs in 2001 were primarily generated by the Global Solutions Inc. start up and its continued expansion throughout 2001. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $67 million, or 18.9% in 2001 due to the capital expenditures necessary to support the growth in cellular and wireline customers. In 2001, Information Services operating expenses decreased $60 million, or 2.9%, largely due to the execution of cost reduction initiatives and merger synergies. Domestic Telecoms operating expenses were essentially flat in 2001 as a result of strong cost containment measures, merger related savings and other cost reductions, partially offset by increased costs associated with our growth businesses such as long distance and data services. Also included in 2001 operating expenses is a pretax charge of $285 million ($172 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted share) related to losses, and service disruption and restoration costs, associated with the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (also see "Segment Results of Operations Domestic Telecom"). In 2002, we anticipate incurring similar costs of up to $.04 per diluted share. The net income impact includes a reduction for a preliminary assessment of insurance recovery. Verizons insurance policies are limited to losses of $1 billion for each occurrence and include a deductible of $1 million. The cost and insurance recovery were recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01 10, "Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001." Additionally, governmental reimbursement mechanisms are under consideration but have not been finalized at this time and accordingly, we cannot determine the potential impact. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $580 million, or 6.6%, in 2001 principally due to growth in depreciable telephone plant and increased software amortization costs. These factors were partially offset by the effect of lower rates of depreciation. Operating expenses associated with operations sold in 2000, including the wireline access lines, as well as Genuitys operating expenses reported prior to the deconsolidation of Genuity on June 30, 2000 and other special items represented a reduction of consolidated operating expenses in 2001 of $1,285 million. Consolidated operating expenses in 2001 also included several other special items. Transition costs related to the Bell Atlantic Corporation GTE Corporation merger and the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture were $1,039 million ($578 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.21 per diluted share) in 2001, compared to $694 million ($316 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.12 per diluted share) in 2000. In addition, we recognized net losses in operations related to sales of assets, impairments of assets held for sale and other charges of $350 million ($226 million, or $.08 per diluted share) in 2001, compared to net gains related to sales of assets and impairments of assets held for sale of $3,793 million ($1,987 million after tax, or $.73 per diluted share). Also during the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a special charge of $1,596 million ($984 million after tax, or $.36 per diluted share) primarily associated with employee severance costs and related pension enhancements. In 2000, we recorded pension settlement gains of $911 million ($564 million after tax, or $.21 per diluted share). Those gains relate to settlements of pension obligations for some former GTE employees. Also in 2001, we recorded a charge of $672 million ($663 million after tax, or $.24 per diluted share) primarily relating to our cellular subsidiary in Argentina, given the current status of the Argentinean economy, the recent devaluation of the Argentinean peso as well as future economic prospects, including a worsening of the recession. Other charges and special items in 2001 and 2000 include asset impairments and investment write offs. 2000 Compared to 1999 In 2000, Domestic Telecoms operations and support expenses increased by $846 million, or 3.6% principally as a result of higher costs associated with entering new growth businesses and higher interconnection payments to CLECs and other carriers to terminate calls on their networks (reciprocal compensation). Higher costs at our telephone operations, including salary and wage increases for management and non management employees and the effect of higher work force levels also contributed to cost increases in 2000, partially offset by lower employee benefit costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $552 million, or 6.7%, in 2000 principally due to growth in depreciable telephone plant and increased software amortization costs. These factors were partially offset by the effect of lower rates of depreciation. Domestic Wirelesss operations and support expenses increased by $4,397 million, or 85.1% in 2000. The increased costs in 2000 were principally the result of the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture in April 2000, as well as costs associated with customer growth and digital migration. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1,794 million, or 163.1% in 2000. The increase was mainly attributable to the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture in April 2000, as well as increased capital expenditures to support the increasing demand for wireless services. Internationals operations and support expenses increased by $164 million, or 13.7%, in 2000. The higher costs were associated with our wireless operations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $91 million, or 34.5%, in 2000 as a result of capital expenditures necessary to support the growth in cellular and wireline customers. In 2000, Information Services operating expenses increased $17 million, or 0.8% compared to 1999. Cost control programs related to directory publishing limited expense increases in 2000. Operating expenses associated with operations sold in 2000 and 1999, including GTE Government Systems and the wireline access lines, as well as a full year of Genuitys operating expenses represented a reduction of consolidated operating expenses in 2000 of $1,474 million. Consolidated operating expenses in 2000 also included several special items. Direct incremental and employee severance costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger of $1,056 million ($749 million after tax, or $.27 per diluted share) include compensation, professional services, severance and other costs. For 2000, transition costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger and the formation of the Verizon Wireless joint venture were $694 million ($316 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.12 per diluted share). In connection with the Bell Atlantic NYNEX Corporation merger, we recorded transition costs $205 million ($126 million after tax, or $.05 per diluted share) in 1999. In addition, during 2000 and 1999, we recognized net gains related to sales of assets and impairments of assets held for sale of $3,793 million ($1,987 million after tax, or $.73 per diluted share) and $1,379 million ($819 million after tax, or $.29 per diluted share), respectively. Also in 2000 and 1999, we recorded pension settlement gains of $911 million and $663 million pretax ($564 million and $410 million after tax, or $.21 and $.15 per diluted share), respectively, related to settlements of pension obligations for some former GTE employees. Other charges and special items in 2000 and 1999 include asset impairments and investment write offs. Consolidated Net Income 2001 Compared to 2000 Included in results of operations for 2001 is the recognition of pretax losses totaling $5,937 million ($4,858 million after tax, or $1.78 diluted loss per share) primarily relating to our investments in Genuity, Cable & Wireless plc (C&W), NTL Incorporated (NTL) and Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc. (MFN). We determined that market value declines in these investments were considered other than temporary. Substantially all of this total charge was recorded in Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Businesses. In 2000, we recorded a non cash pretax gain of $3,088 million ($1,941 million after tax, or $.71 per diluted share) in Income (Loss) From Unconsolidated Businesses in connection with the restructuring of Cable & Wireless Communications plc (CWC). In connection with this restructuring, we received shares of C&W and NTL. Internationals income from unconsolidated businesses increased by $247 million, or 36.8% in 2001. This increase was primarily due to improved operational growth at Omnitel Pronto Italia S.p.A. (Omnitel) and Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV). During 2001, we recorded mark to market losses of $182 million ($179 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.07 per diluted share) related to some of our financial instruments in accordance with newly effective accounting rules on derivative financial instruments. In 2000, we recorded a gain on a mark to market adjustment of $664 million ($431 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to our notes which are exchangeable into shares of C&W and NTL. During the second half of 2000, we completed the sale of several overlapping wireless properties resulting in a total pretax gain of $1,724 million ($1,039 million after tax, or $.38 per diluted share). Since the sales were required by a consent decree and occurred after the Bell Atlantic GTE merger, the gains on sales were recorded net of taxes as Extraordinary Items. In 2001, we adopted the provisions of new accounting rules on derivative financial instruments. The initial impact of adoption was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $182 million after tax (or $.07 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2001. We adopted the provisions of new accounting rules on revenue recognition in 2000. Our 2000 results include the initial impact of adoption recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $40 million after tax (or $.01 per diluted share). 2000 Compared to 1999 In 2000, we recorded a non cash pretax gain of $3,088 million ($1,941 million after tax, or $.71 per diluted share) in Income (Loss) From Unconsolidated Businesses in connection with the restructuring of CWC. In connection with this restructuring, we received shares of C&W and NTL. Internationals income from unconsolidated businesses increased by $125 million, or 22.9% in 2000. This increase was primarily due to strong subscriber growth at Taiwan Cellular Corporation and Omnitel and a full twelve months of operations at Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. (TELPRI) in 2000, as well as the cessation of recording equity losses from our investment in BayanTel, a Philippines based telecommunications company. These increases in 2000 were partially offset by lower results at CANTV driven by the weakened Venezuelan economy and delayed tariff increases, as well as lower income from Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited (TCNZ) driven by a change from the equity to cost method of accounting and a reduction in the TCNZ dividend payout ratio. In 2000, we recorded a gain on a mark to market adjustment of $664 million ($431 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to our notes which are exchangeable into shares of C&W and NTL. In 1999, we recorded a loss on a mark to market adjustment of $664 million ($432 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to these notes. During the second half of 2000, we completed the sale of several overlapping wireless properties resulting in a total pretax gain of $1,724 million ($1,039 million after tax, or $.38 per diluted share). Since the sales were required by a consent decree and occurred after the merger, the gains on sales were recorded net of taxes as Extraordinary Items. During 1999, we recorded a pretax extraordinary charge of $56 million ($36 million after tax, or $.01 per diluted share) associated with the early extinguishment of debt. We adopted the provisions of new accounting rules on revenue recognition in 2000. Our 2000 results include the initial impact of adoption recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $40 million after tax (or $.01 per diluted share). Consolidated net income available to common shareowners was $389 million ($.14 per diluted share), $11,787 million ($4.31 per diluted share) and $8,260 million ($2.97 per diluted share) in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our reported results for all three years were affected by special items. These special items, described in detail on pages 9 to 13, impacted consolidated net income available to common shareowners by $7,801 million ($2.86 per diluted share), $(3,825) million ($1.40 per diluted share) and $(365) million ($.13 per diluted share) in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Segment Results of Operations We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on segment income. This segment income excludes unallocated corporate expenses and other adjustments arising during each period. The other adjustments include transactions that the chief operating decision makers exclude in assessing business unit performance due primarily to their nonrecurring and or non operational nature. Although such transactions are excluded from business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. We previously highlighted the more significant of these transactions in the "Consolidated Results of Operations" section. Gains and losses that are not individually significant are included in all segment results, since these items are included in the chief operating decision makers assessment of unit performance. These are mostly contained in International and Information Services since they actively manage investment portfolios. Further information about our segments can be found in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. Domestic Telcom Domestic Telecom provides local telephone services, including voice and data transport, enhanced and custom calling features, network access, directory assistance, private lines and public telephones in 32 states and the District of Columbia. This segment also provides long distance services, customer premises equipment distribution, data solutions and systems integration, billing and collections, Internet access services, research and development and inventory management services. Highlights Operating Revenues Domestic Telecom ended the year 2001 with a slight decline in operating revenues of 0.6%, compared to an increase of 3.9% in 2000. In 2001, Domestic Telecoms revenue growth rates were pressured by several factors including the weakened U.S. economy, which has dampened demand for basic wireline and other services, and rate reductions mandated by regulators. In addition, Domestic Telecom continues to be affected by competition and technology substitution, as more customers are choosing wireless and Internet services in place of some basic wireline services. Despite these challenges, our data transport and long distance businesses continued to show solid demand and revenue growth. Data transport revenues, which include our high bandwidth, packet switched and special access services, as well as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) services, grew more than 21% over 2000 and 32% over 1999. We ended 2001 with data circuits in service equivalent to 71 million voice grade access lines, up 31% from 2000. Data circuits now account for more than half of Verizons 132 million access line equivalents, as more customers chose high capacity, high speed transport services. In 2000, data circuits in service were equivalent to 54 million voice grade access lines, more than a 65% increase over 1999. Operating revenues were also fueled by strong growth in our interLATA long distance business. We ended the year 2001 with 7.4 million long distance customers nationwide, an increase of 2.7 million subscribers or 59% over 2000. We now offer long distance service to more than two thirds of all Verizon access lines. In 2000, we entered the in region long distance market in New York, and in 2001 we entered the Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in region long distance markets. At year end 2000, long distance subscribers totaled nearly 4.7 million nationwide, an increase of nearly 50% from the prior year. Our revenues were negatively affected by federal and state regulatory price reductions of approximately $660 million in 2001, $860 million in 2000 and $660 million in 1999, primarily affecting our network access revenues. Operating Expenses Domestic Telecoms operating expenses were essentially flat in 2001 as a result of strong cost containment measures, merger related savings and other cost reductions. Operating expenses in 2001 also included added costs related to the events of September 11th and increased costs associated with our growth businesses such as long distance and data services. These entry costs include customer acquisition expenses associated with the launch of long distance in several states and costs related to marketing, distribution and service installation of our DSL service. In 2000, increased operating expenses were principally due to higher costs associated with entering new businesses, partially offset by the effect of cost containment measures. Wireline Property Sales We have either sold or committed to sell wireline properties representing approximately 2.9 million access lines or 2.2% of the total Domestic Telecom access line equivalents. The effect of these dispositions largely depends on the timing of the sales and the reinvestment of the proceeds. As of December 31, 2001, we have sold all but approximately 1.2 million access lines that we committed to sell. Those remaining access lines are under definitive sale agreements. For comparability purposes, the results of operations shown in the table below exclude the operating revenues and expenses contributed by the properties that have been sold in 2000. No access lines were sold in 2001. These operating revenues were approximately $766 million and $1,151 million for the years 2000 and 1999, respectively. Operating expenses contributed by the sold properties were $253 million and $378 million for the years 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net income contributed by the sold properties was approximately $314 million and $475 million for the years 2000 and 1999, respectively. For additional information on wireline property sales, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional financial information about Domestic Telecoms results of operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 follows: Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Local services $ 21,918 $ 22,033 $ 20,733 Network access services 13,379 13,142 12,827 Long distance services 3,107 3,152 3,183 Other services 4,674 5,016 4,980 $ 43,078 $ 43,343 $ 41,723 Local Services Local service revenues are earned by our telephone operations from the provision of local exchange, local private line, wire maintenance, voice messaging and value added services. Value added services are a family of services that expand the utilization of the network, including products such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and Return Call. The provision of local exchange services not only includes retail revenue but also includes local wholesale revenues from unbundled network elements (UNEs), interconnection revenues from CLECs, wireless interconnection revenues and some data transport revenues. In 2001, local service revenues declined $115 million, or 0.5% due to the effects of lower demand and usage of our basic local wireline services and mandated intrastate price reductions. Our switched access lines in service declined 2.1% from December 31, 2000, primarily reflecting the impact of an economic slowdown and competition for some local services. Technology substitution also affected local service revenue growth, as indicated by lower demand for additional residential access lines. These factors were partially offset by higher payments received from CLECs for interconnection of their networks with our network and by solid demand for our value added services as a result of new packaging of services. In 2000, growth in local service revenues of $1,300 million, or 6.3% was driven by higher interconnection revenues from CLECs and higher usage of our network facilities. Volume related growth, generated in part by an increase in switched access lines in service of 1.4% from December 31, 1999, reflected higher customer demand and usage of our data transport and digital services. Solid demand for our value added services, as well as growth in wireless interconnection, inside wire maintenance, and national directory assistance services further contributed to higher local service revenues in 2000. Revenue growth was also partially attributable to the favorable resolution of various regulatory matters and the impact of implementing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." Revenue growth associated with SAB No. 101 was entirely offset by corresponding increases in operating expenses. Local service revenue growth in 2000 was partially offset by the effect of resold and UNE platforms, as well as the effect of net regulatory price reductions and customer rebates. See "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results" for additional information on the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act) and its impact on local services. Network Access Services Network access services revenues are earned from end user subscribers and long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities to provide usage services to their customers. Switched access revenues are derived from fixed and usage based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network. Special access revenues originate from carriers and end users that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks. End user access revenues are earned from our customers and from resellers who purchase dial tone services. Our network access revenues grew $237 million, or 1.8%, in 2001 and $315 million, or 2.5%, in 2000. This growth was mainly attributable to higher customer demand, primarily for special access services (including DSL) that grew approximately 24% in 2001 and 36% in 2000. Special access revenue growth in both years reflects strong demand in the business market for high capacity, high speed digital services. Revenue growth in 2001 was affected by the slowing economy, as reflected by a 1.0% decline in minutes of use from carriers and CLECs and a 2.1% reduction in switched access lines in service. In 2000, growth in minutes of use from carriers and CLECs of 5.7% and higher revenues received from customers for the recovery of local number portability also contributed to network access revenue growth. Volume related growth in both years was substantially offset by price reductions associated with federal and state price cap filings and other regulatory decisions. State public utility commissions regulate our telephone operations with respect to some intrastate rates and services and other matters. State rate reductions on access services were approximately $165 million in 2001, $285 million in 2000 and $220 million in 1999. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates the rates that we charge long distance carriers and end user subscribers for interstate access services. We are required to file new access rates with the FCC each year. In July 2000, we implemented the Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Services (CALLS) plan. Rates included in the July 2000 CALLS plan were in effect through June 2001. Effective July 3, 2001, we implemented further rate reductions in accordance with the plan. Interstate price reductions on access services were approximately $300 million in 2001, $520 million in 2000 and $380 million in 1999. See "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results" for additional information on FCC rulemakings concerning federal access rates, universal service and unbundling of network elements. Long Distance Services Long distance service revenues include both intraLATA toll services and interLATA long distance voice and data services. Long distance service revenues declined $45 million, or 1.4%, in 2001 and $31 million, or 1.0% in 2000 primarily due to competition and the effects of toll calling discount packages and product bundling offers of our intraLATA toll services. These reductions were largely offset by revenue growth from our interLATA long distance services, including significant customer win backs resulting from the introduction of interLATA long distance services in New York in 2000 and in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in 2001. See also "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results" for a discussion of our plans to enter the interLATA long distance market in other states in our region. Other Services Our other services include such services as billing and collections for long distance carriers, public (pay) telephone and customer premises equipment services. Other services revenues also include services provided by most of our non regulated subsidiaries such as inventory management and purchasing, Internet access and data solutions and systems integration businesses. Revenues from other services declined $342 million, or 6.8% in 2001 principally as a result of lower sales of customer premises equipment, a decline in public telephone revenues as more customers substituted wireless communications for pay telephone services, and lower billing and collection revenues reflecting the take back of these services by interexchange carriers. Lower data solutions and systems integration revenues due to the slowing economy and the effect of closing our CLEC operation further contributed to the revenue decline in 2001. These revenue reductions were partially offset by higher revenues from other non regulated services. Revenues from other services grew $36 million, or 0.7%, in 2000 primarily due to higher demand for such services as systems integration and data solutions and inventory management and purchasing services, principally due to new contracts with business customers. These factors were partially offset by lower demand for our billing and collection, public telephone and directory services. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operations and support $ 23,928 $ 24,537 $ 23,691 Depreciation and amortization 9,332 8,752 8,200 $ 33,260 $ 33,289 $ 31,891 Operations and Support Operations and support expenses, which consist of employee costs and other operating expenses, decreased by $609 million, or 2.5% in 2001 principally due to lower costs at our domestic telephone operations. These reductions were attributable to lower overtime for repair and maintenance activity principally as a result of reduced volumes at our dispatch and call centers and lower employee costs associated with declining workforce levels. Operating costs have also decreased due to business integration activities and achievement of merger synergies. Other effective cost containment measures, including lower spending by non strategic businesses and closing our CLEC operation, also contributed to cost reductions in 2001. Cost reductions in 2001 were partially offset by additional charges related to the terrorist attacks on September 11th (see "Consolidated Results of Operations" section) and by higher costs associated with our growth businesses such as long distance and data services. Increased costs associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and higher employee benefit costs further offset cost reductions in 2001. The increase in employee benefit costs in 2001 was largely due to increased health care costs driven by inflation, higher savings plan costs and changes in some plan provisions. These factors were partially offset by favorable pension plan income, including gain amortization. In 2000, operations and support expenses increased by $846 million, or 3.6% principally as a result of higher costs associated with entering new growth businesses and higher interconnection payments to CLECs and other carriers to terminate calls on their networks (reciprocal compensation). Higher costs at our telephone operations, including salary and wage increases for management and non management employees and the effect of higher work force levels also contributed to cost increases in 2000. Expense increases also reflect the implementation of SAB No. 101. Expense increases associated with SAB No. 101 were entirely offset by corresponding increases in operating revenues, as described earlier. Cost increases in 2000 were partially offset by lower employee benefit costs. The decline in employee benefit costs in 2000 was chiefly due to favorable pension plan income and changes in actuarial assumptions. These factors were offset, in part, by changes in some plan provisions, increased health care costs caused by inflation, savings plan benefit improvements for some management employees, as well as benefit improvements provided for under new contracts with other employees. In 2000, we executed contracts with unions representing our employees. The new contracts provide for wage and pension increases and other benefit improvements, including annual wage increases of 4%, 3% and 5%, beginning in August 2000. Customer service representatives received an additional 4% wage increase. Pension benefits for active employees increased by 5% on July 1, 2001, and will increase by 5% on July 1, 2002 and 4% on July 1, 2003. The contracts also include team based incentive awards for meeting higher service performance and other standards, increased funding for work and family programs, improvements to health and other benefits and provisions relating to overtime, access to work and employment security. In addition, all union represented employees were granted options to purchase 100 shares of our common stock. For additional information on reciprocal compensation refer to "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results Compensation for Internet Traffic." Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $580 million, or 6.6%, in 2001 and $552 million, or 6.7%, in 2000. Expense increases in both years were principally due to growth in depreciable telephone plant and increased software amortization costs. These factors were partially offset by the effect of lower rates of depreciation. Segment Income (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Segment Income $ 4,910 $ 5,135 $ 5,020 Segment income decreased by $225 million, or 4.4% from 2000 and increased by $115 million, or 2.3% in 2000 primarily as a result of the after tax impact of operating revenue and operating expenses described above. Special items of $1,546 million, $(922) million and $(644) million, after tax, affected the Domestic Telecom segment in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Special items in 2001 primarily related to merger related costs and severance and retirement enhancement costs, special items in 2000 pertained to gains on sales of assets, net, pension settlement gains and merger related costs and 1999 special items included pension settlement gains. Domestic Wireless Our Domestic Wireless segment provides wireless voice and data services, paging services and equipment sales. This segment primarily represents the operations of the Verizon Wireless joint venture. Verizon Wireless was formed in April 2000 through the combination of our wireless properties with the U.S. properties and paging assets of Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone), including the consolidation of PrimeCo Communications (PrimeCo). Verizon owns a 55% interest in the joint venture and Vodafone owns the remaining 45%. The 2001 financial results included in the table below reflect the combined results of Verizon Wireless. The period prior to the formation of Verizon Wireless is reported on a historical basis, and therefore, does not reflect the contribution of the Vodafone properties and the consolidation of PrimeCo. In addition, the financial results of several overlap properties, that were subsequently sold, were included in Domestic Wirelesss results through June 30, 2000. Highlights Our Domestic Wireless segment ended the year 2001 with 29.4 million customers, an increase of 9.8% over year end 2000. At year end 2000, customers totaled approximately 26.8 million, an increase of 83.4% over year end 1999. At year end 1999, customers totaled approximately 14.2 million. All customer counts have been restated for a first quarter 2001 customer base adjustment. The 2000 growth in customers is primarily attributable to the formation of Verizon Wireless in April 2000. Approximately 22 million, or almost 75%, of Verizon Wireless customers now subscribe to CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) digital services, and generate more than 93% of our busy hour usage, compared to 80% at year end 2000. In addition, almost 850,000 customers subscribe to the companys wireless data services, including Mobile Web Internet access. In December 2001, Verizon Wireless and Price Communications Corporation agreed to combine the business operations of Price Communications Wireless, Inc. and a portion of Verizon Wireless, in a transaction valued at $1.7 billion, including $550 million in net debt that will be assumed or redeemed. Under the terms of the transaction, which replaces an agreement announced by the companies in November 2000, Price Communications Wireless and Verizon Wireless will form a limited partnership consisting of substantially all of the assets of Price Communications wireless operations and some of Verizon Wirelesss assets. Verizon Wireless will control and manage the partnership. Price Communications partnership interest will be exchangeable into Verizon Wireless or Verizon stock, subject to several conditions. The transaction, which remains subject to the approval of Price Communications shareholders and other customary closing conditions, will significantly expand the companys footprint in the Southeastern U.S. and add approximately 560,000 customers. Additional financial information about Domestic Wireless results of operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 follows: Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Wireless services $ 17,393 $ 14,236 $ 7,653 Revenues earned from our consolidated wireless businesses grew by $3,157 million, or 22.2%, in 2001 and $6,583 million, or 86.0%, in 2000. By including the revenues of the properties of the wireless joint venture and excluding the impact of wireless overlap properties on a basis comparable with 2001, revenues were $2,030 million, or 13.2%, higher than 2000. On this comparable basis, revenue growth was largely attributable to customer additions and slightly higher revenue per customer per month. Our domestic wireless customer base grew to 29.4 million customers in 2001, compared to 26.8 million customers in 2000, an increase of nearly 10%. Revenues for 2000 were $14,236 million, an increase of $6,583 million, or 86.0%, compared to 1999. By including the revenues of the properties of the wireless joint venture on a basis comparable with 2000, revenues were $2,300 million, or 19.3%, higher than 1999. The revenue growth was due to the growth in the customer base and stable revenue per customer per month. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operations and support $ 11,379 $ 9,563 $ 5,166 Depreciation and amortization 3,709 2,894 1,100 $ 15,088 $ 12,457 $ 6,266 Operations and Support Operations and support expenses, which represent employee costs and other operating expenses, increased by $1,816 million, or 19.0%, in 2001 and $4,397 million, or 85.1%, in 2000. By including the expenses of the properties of the wireless joint venture on a basis comparable with 2001, operations and support expenses were $1,186 million, or 11.6%, higher than 2000. Higher costs were attributable to the growth in the subscriber base described above, as well as the continuing migration of analog customers to digital. The increased costs in 2000 were principally the result of the formation of the wireless joint venture in April 2000, as well as costs associated with customer growth and digital migration. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $815 million, or 28.2%, in 2001 and by $1,794 million, or 163.1%, in 2000. The increase in 2001 over the prior year was primarily due to increased capital expenditures to support the increasing demand for wireless services. Adjusting for the joint venture in a manner similar to operations and support expenses above, depreciation and amortization was $336 million, or 10.0%, higher than 2000. Capital expenditures for our cellular network have increased in 2001 and 2000 to support increased demand in all markets. The 2000 increase was mainly attributable to the formation of the wireless joint venture in April 2000, as well as increased capital expenditures to support the increasing demand for wireless services. Segment Income (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Segment Income $ 537 $ 444 $ 628 Segment income increased by $93 million, or 20.9% from 2000 and decreased by $184 million, or 29.3% in 2000 primarily as a result of the after tax impact of operating revenue and operating expenses described above as well as minority interest and interest expense. Special items of $107 million, $(410) million and $14 million, after tax, affected the Domestic Wireless segment in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Special items in 2001 primarily related to merger related costs and special items in 2000 pertained to gains on sales of assets, net and merger related costs. The increases in minority interest in 2001 and 2000 and interest expense in 2000 were principally due to the increased income of the wireless joint venture and the significant minority interest attributable to Vodafone beginning in April 2000. International Our International segment includes international wireline and wireless telecommunication operations, investments and management contracts in the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Our consolidated international investments as of December 31, 2001 included Grupo Iusacell (Iusacell) (Mexico), CODETEL (Dominican Republic), CTI Holdings, S.A. (CTI) (Argentina), Micronesian Telecommunications Corporation (Northern Mariana Islands) and Global Solutions. Our international investments in which we have a less than controlling interest are accounted for on either the cost or equity method. Highlights International net income grew $225 million, or 30.7%, in 2001 and $115 million, or 18.6%, in 2000. This growth was aided by the continued worldwide demand for wireless services. The number of proportionate international wireless customers served by Verizon investments increased 1.8 million in 2001 to 9.6 million. On January 25, 2002, Verizon exercised its option to purchase an additional 12% of TELPRI common stock from the government of Puerto Rico. Verizon obtained the option as part of the March 1999 TELPRI privatization. Accordingly, we now hold 52% of TELPRI stock, up from 40% and will begin consolidating TELPRI in 2002. On June 6, 2001, we exercised an option to exchange 15 million shares in FLAG Telecom Holdings Ltd. (FLAG) for shares in TyCom Ltd., which were subsequently exchanged for Tyco International Ltd. shares. As a result of this transaction, our interest in FLAG declined from 29.8% to 18.6%, and the investment is now accounted for on a cost basis. In February 2001, Verizon launched an initiative designed to expand our presence in the carrier and large business market. The new business unit, Global Solutions, will offer a primarily facilities based network which connects commercial centers around the world and provides an array of voice, data and Internet services. Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Wireless services $ 1,358 $ 1,218 $ 974 Wireline and other services 979 758 740 $ 2,337 $ 1,976 $ 1,714 The revenues and operating expenses for the International segment exclude QuebecTel, which was deconsolidated in the second quarter of 2000. QuebecTels net results for all periods are included in Income From Unconsolidated Businesses. Revenues earned from our international businesses grew by $361 million, or 18.3%, in 2001 and by $262 million, or 15.3%, in 2000. The increase in wireless revenues was primarily due to the increase in wireless subscribers of consolidated subsidiaries. CTIs Buenos Aires wireless operations, which commenced commercial operations in the second quarter of 2000, contributed $108 million to the 2001 year over year wireless revenue increase. Revenues generated by Global Solutions, which began its operations in the first quarter of 2001, also contributed to the increase in wireline and other services in 2001. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operations and support $ 1,622 $ 1,359 $ 1,195 Depreciation and amortization 422 355 264 $ 2,044 $ 1,714 $ 1,459 Operations and Support Operations and support expenses, which represent employee costs and other operating expenses, increased by $263 million, or 19.4%, in 2001 and by $164 million, or 13.7%, in 2000. The higher costs in 2001 were primarily generated by the Global Solutions start up and its continued expansion throughout 2001. In addition, CTIs Buenos Aires wireless operations contributed to higher costs in both years. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $67 million, or 18.9%, in 2001 and by $91 million, or 34.5%, in 2000. The increase in both years was attributable to the capital expenditures necessary to support the growth in cellular subscribers and CODETELs wireline customers. The build out of CTIs Buenos Aires wireless operations also contributed to the increased depreciation for both years. Segment Income (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Segment Income $ 958 $ 733 $ 618 Segment income increased by $225 million, or 30.7% from 2000 and increased by $115 million, or 18.6% in 2000 primarily as a result of the after tax impact of operating revenue and operating expenses described above as well as income from unconsolidated businesses. Special items of $2,953 million, $(1,814) million and $10 million, after tax, affected the International segment in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Special items in 2001 primarily related to loss on securities and a loss on our Argentinean cellular subsidiary and special items in 2000 pertained to the CWC restructuring gain and merger related costs. Income from unconsolidated businesses increased by $247 million, or 36.8%, in 2001 and by $125 million, or 22.9%, in 2000. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to improved operational growth at Omnitel and CANTV. Although CANTVs historical operational performance has improved, economic and political instability in Venezuela has had an adverse effect on CANTVs operations. This instability, along with significant devaluation of the currency that occurred subsequent to the governments recent decision to allow the currency to float freely, may impact our investment in CANTV if these conditions continue. At December 31, 2001, based on our forecast of CANTVs undiscounted cash flows, our investment in CANTV continues to be recoverable. We are currently assessing the impact of the recent and significant currency devaluation on the future undiscounted cash flows of CANTV and its impact on the recoverability of our investment. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to strong subscriber growth at Taiwan Cellular Corporation and Omnitel and a full twelve months of operations at TELPRI in 2000, as well as the cessation of recording equity losses from our investment in BayanTel, a Philippines based telecommunications company. These increases in 2000 were partially offset by lower results at CANTV driven by the weakened Venezuelan economy and delayed tariff increases, as well as lower income from TCNZ driven by a change from the equity to cost method of accounting and a reduction in the TCNZ dividend payout ratio. Information Services Our Information Services segment consists of our domestic and international publishing businesses, including print and electronic directories and Internet based shopping guides, as well as website creation and other electronic commerce services. Our directory business uses the publication date method for recognizing revenues. Under that method, costs and advertising revenues associated with the publication of a directory are recognized when the directory is distributed. This segment has operations principally in North America, Europe and Latin America. Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Information services $ 4,313 $ 4,144 $ 4,086 Operating revenues from our Information Services segment increased $169 million, or 4.1%, in 2001. The 2001 revenue increase was due primarily to growth in directory advertising revenues and extension revenues, continued growth of our Internet directory service, SuperPages.com(R), and increased revenue from the 2001 acquisition of TELUS Corporations (TELUS) advertising services business in Canada, offset by reductions in affiliated revenues from Domestic Telecom. Operating revenues from our Information Services segment improved by $58 million, or 1.4%, in 2000. The 2000 revenue increases were primarily generated by growth in print directory advertising revenue and expansion of our Internet directory service, SuperPages.com(R), offset by reductions in affiliated revenues from Domestic Telecom. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operations and support $ 1,961 $ 2,026 $ 2,007 Depreciation and amortization 79 74 76 $ 2,040 $ 2,100 $ 2,083 In 2001, total operating expenses decreased $60 million, or 2.9%, largely due to the execution of cost reduction initiatives and merger synergies. In 2000, total operating expenses increased $17 million, or 0.8%, from the corresponding period in 1999. Cost control programs related to directory publishing limited expense increases in 2000. Segment Income (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Segment Income $ 1,352 $ 1,238 $ 1,211 Segment income increased by $114 million, or 9.2% from 2000 and increased by $27 million, or 2.2% in 2000 primarily as a result of the after tax impact of operating revenue and operating expenses described above. Special items of $81 million, $140 million and $14 million, after tax, affected the Information Services segment in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Special items in 2001 primarily related to merger related costs and special items in 2000 pertained to losses on sales of assets, net and merger related costs. Special Items Special items generally represent revenues and gains as well as expenses and losses that are nonrecurring and or non operational in nature. Several of these special items include impairment losses. These impairment losses were determined in accordance with our policy of comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. The fair value is determined by quoted market prices or by estimates of future cash flows. These special items are not considered in assessing operational performance, either at the segment level, or for the consolidated company. However, they are included in our reported results. This section provides a detailed description of these special items. Completion of Mergers In June 2000, Bell Atlantic and GTE completed a merger under a definitive merger agreement dated as of July 27, 1998 and began doing business as Verizon Communications. The following table summarizes the pretax charges incurred for the Bell Atlantic GTE merger. Amounts for 2001 and 2000 pertain to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger. Transition costs for 1999 pertain to the Bell Atlantic NYNEX merger, which was completed in August 1997. (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Direct Incremental Costs Compensation arrangements $ $ 210 $ Professional services 161 Shareowner related 35 Registration, regulatory and other 66 Total Direct Incremental Costs 472 Employee Severance Costs 584 Transition Costs Systems modifications 401 99 186 Branding 112 240 1 Relocation, training and other 526 355 18 Total Transition Costs 1,039 694 205 Total Merger Related Costs $ 1,039 $ 1,750 $ 205 Merger Related Costs Direct Incremental Costs Direct incremental costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger of $472 million ($378 million after tax, or $.14 per diluted share) include compensation, professional services and other costs. Compensation includes retention payments to employees that were contingent on the close of the merger and payments to employees to satisfy contractual obligations triggered by the changes in control. Professional services include investment banking, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees incurred to obtain federal and state regulatory approvals and take other actions necessary to complete the merger. Other includes costs incurred to obtain shareholder approval of the merger, register securities and communicate with shareholders, employees and regulatory authorities regarding merger issues. Employee Severance Costs Employee severance costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger of $584 million ($371 million after tax, or $.14 per diluted share) as recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112, "Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," represent the benefit costs for the separation of approximately 5,500 management employees who were entitled to benefits under pre existing separation plans, as well as an accrual for ongoing SFAS No. 112 obligations for GTE employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,200 were located in the United States and approximately 300 were located at various international locations. The separations either have or are expected to occur as a result of consolidations and process enhancements within our operating segments. The remaining severance liability under this program as of December 31, 2001 is $220 million. Transition Costs In addition to the direct incremental merger related and severance costs discussed above, we expect to incur a total of approximately $2 billion of transition costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger and the formation of the wireless joint venture. These costs will be incurred to integrate systems, consolidate real estate, and relocate employees. They also include approximately $500 million for advertising and other costs to establish the Verizon brand. For 2001 and 2000, transition costs related to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger and the formation of the wireless joint venture were $1,039 million ($578 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.21 per diluted share) and $694 million ($316 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.12 per diluted share), respectively. In connection with the Bell Atlantic NYNEX merger, we recorded transition costs similar in nature to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger transition costs of $205 million ($126 million after tax, or $.05 per diluted share) in 1999. Sales of Assets, Net During 2001, we recognized net losses in operations related to sales of assets, impairments of assets held for sale and other charges. During 2000 and 1999, we recognized net gains related to sales of assets and impairments of assets held for sale. These net gains and losses are summarized as follows: (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Pretax After tax Pretax After tax Pretax After tax Wireline property sales $ $ $ 3,051 $ 1,856 $ $ Wireless overlap sales (92) (60) 1,922 1,156 Other, net (258) (166) (1,180) (1,025) 1,379 819 $ (350) $ (226) $ 3,793 $ 1,987 $ 1,379 $ 819 As required, gains on sales of wireless overlap properties that occurred prior to the closing of the Bell Atlantic GTE merger are included in operating income and in the table above. Gains on sales of significant wireless overlap properties that occurred after the Bell Atlantic GTE merger are classified as extraordinary items. See "Extraordinary Items" below for gains on sales of significant wireless overlap properties subsequent to the Bell Atlantic GTE merger. Wireline Property Sales During 1998, GTE committed to sell approximately 1.6 million nonstrategic domestic access lines. During 2000, access line sales generated combined cash proceeds of approximately $4,903 million and $125 million in convertible preferred stock. The pretax gain on the sales was $3,051 million ($1,856 million after tax, or $.68 per diluted share). Wireless Overlap Sales A U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) consent decree issued on December 6, 1999 required GTE Wireless, Bell Atlantic Mobile, Vodafone and PrimeCo to resolve a number of wireless market overlaps in order to complete the wireless joint venture and the Bell Atlantic GTE merger. As a result, during April 2000 we completed a transaction with ALLTEL Corporation that provided for the exchange of former Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE Wireless markets for several of ALLTELs wireless markets. These exchanges were accounted for as purchase business combinations and resulted in combined pretax gains of $1,922 million ($1,156 million after tax, or $.42 per diluted share). During 2001, we recorded a pretax gain of $80 million ($48 million after tax, or $.02 per diluted share) on the sale of the Cincinnati market and a pretax loss of $172 million ($108 million after tax, or $.04 per diluted share) related to the sale of the Chicago market. Other Transactions During 2001, we recorded charges totaling $258 million pretax ($166 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted share) related to exiting several businesses, including our video business and some leasing activities. During 2000, we recorded charges related to the write down of some impaired assets and other charges of $1,180 million pretax ($1,025 million after tax, or $.37 per diluted share), as follows: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, 2000 Pretax After tax Per diluted share Airfone and Video impairment $ 566 $ 362 $ .13 CLEC impairment 334 218 .08 Real estate consolidation and other merger related charges 220 142 .05 Deferred taxes on contribution to the wireless joint venture 249 .09 Other, net 60 54 .02 $ 1,180 $ 1,025 $ .37 In connection with our decisions to exit the video business and Airfone (a company involved in air to ground communications), in the second quarter of 2000 we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these investments to their estimated net realizable value. The CLEC impairment primarily relates to the revaluation of assets and the accrual of costs pertaining to some long term contracts due to strategic changes in our approach to offering bundled services both in and out of franchise areas. The revised approach to providing such services resulted, in part, from post merger integration activities and acquisitions. The real estate consolidation and other merger related charges include the revaluation of assets and the accrual of costs to exit leased facilities that are in excess of our needs as the result of post merger integration activities. The deferred tax charge is non cash and was recorded as the result of the contribution in July 2000 of the GTE Wireless assets to Verizon Wireless based on the differences between the book and tax bases of assets contributed. During 1999, we sold substantially all of GTE Government Systems to General Dynamics Corporation for $1 billion in cash. The pretax gain on the sale was $754 million ($445 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share). In addition, during 1999, we recorded a net pretax gain of $112 million ($66 million after tax, or $.02 per diluted share), primarily associated with the sale of the remaining major division of GTE Government Systems to DynCorp. The 1999 year to date net gains for asset sales also include a pretax gain of $513 million ($308 million after tax, or $.11 per diluted share) associated with the merger of BC TELECOM Inc. and TELUS during the first quarter of 1999. Severance/Retirement Enhancement Costs and Settlement Gains During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a special charge of $1,613 million ($1,001 million after tax, or $.37 per diluted share) primarily associated with employee severance costs and related pension enhancements. The charge included severance and related benefits of $765 million ($477 million after tax, or $.18 per diluted share), as recorded under SFAS No. 112, for the voluntary and involuntary separation of approximately 10,000 employees. We also included a charge of $848 million ($524 million after tax, or $.19 per diluted share) recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 88, "Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," which includes pension enhancements of $813 million ($504 million after tax, or $.18 per diluted share) and pension settlement losses of $35 million ($20 million after tax, or $.01 per diluted share), relating to lump sum settlements of some existing pension obligations. In 2000 and 1999, we recorded pension settlement gains of $911 million and $663 million pretax ($564 million and $410 million after tax, or $.21 and $.15 per diluted share), respectively, in accordance with SFAS No. 88. They relate to some settlements of pension obligations for former GTE employees through direct payment, the purchase of annuities or otherwise. Pretax pension income, net of postretirement benefit costs, recorded by Verizon in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1,320 million, $3,095 million and $1,440 million, respectively. Adjusting for the special items above, pretax pension income, net of postretirement benefit costs, was $2,168 million, $2,184 million and $777 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2000, after adjusting for the special items, is primarily the result of higher returns on plan assets and actuarial gains. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our pension plans, accounting for defined benefit pension plans and significant actuarial assumptions, as well as changes in those assumptions. Loss/(Gain) on Securities We continually evaluate our investments in securities for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary. That evaluation includes, in addition to persistent, declining stock prices, general economic and company specific evaluations. In the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other than temporary, a charge to earnings is recorded for the loss and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Prior to the second quarter of 2001, we considered the declines in the market values of our investments in securities to be temporary, due principally to the overall weakness in the securities markets as well as telecommunications sector share prices. However, included in our results for 2001 is the recognition of pretax losses recorded in June 2001 and December 2001 totaling $4,686 million ($3,607 million after tax, or $1.32 diluted loss per share) primarily relating to our investments in C&W, NTL and MFN. We determined, through the evaluation described above, that market value declines in these investments were considered other than temporary. During 2001, we also recorded a pretax charge of $1,251 million ($1,251 million after tax, or $.46 per diluted share) related to our cost investment in Genuity. The charge was necessary because we determined that the decline in the estimated fair value of Genuity was other than temporary. Our investment in Genuity is not considered a marketable security given its unique characteristics and the associated contingent conversion right (see "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results" for additional information). However, we estimated fair value based on the number of shares of Genuity we would own, assuming the exercise of the contingent conversion right, and the market value of Genuity common stock. In May 2000, C&W, NTL and CWC completed a restructuring of CWC. Under the terms of the restructuring, CWCs consumer cable telephone, television and Internet operations were separated from its corporate, business, Internet protocol and wholesale operations. After the separation, the consumer operations were acquired by NTL and the other operations were acquired by C&W. In connection with the restructuring, we, as a shareholder in CWC, received shares in the two acquiring companies, representing approximately 9.1% of the NTL shares outstanding at the time and approximately 4.6% of the C&W shares outstanding at the time. Our exchange of CWC shares for C&W and NTL shares resulted in the recognition of a non cash pretax gain of $3,088 million ($1,941 million after tax, or $.71 per diluted share) in Income (Loss) From Unconsolidated Businesses in the consolidated statements of income and a corresponding increase in the cost basis of the shares received. Mark to Market Adjustment Financial Instruments During 2001, we began recording mark to market adjustments in earnings relating to some of our financial instruments in accordance with newly effective accounting rules on derivative financial instruments. Mark to market losses of $182 million ($179 million after taxes and minority interest, or $.07 per diluted share) were recorded in 2001 due primarily to the change in the fair value of the MFN debt conversion option. In 2000, we recorded a gain on a mark to market adjustment of $664 million ($431 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to our $3,180 million of notes which are exchangeable into shares of C&W and NTL. Prior to the reorganization of CWC in May 2000, these notes were exchangeable into shares of CWC. In 1999, we recorded a loss on a mark to market adjustment of $664 million ($432 million after tax, or $.16 per diluted share) related to these notes. These mark to market adjustments are non cash, non operational transactions that result in either an increase or decrease in the carrying value of the debt obligation and a charge or credit to income. The mark to market adjustments are required because the carrying value of the notes is indexed to the fair market value of C&Ws and NTLs common stock. If the combined fair value of the C&W and NTL common stock declines, our debt obligation is reduced (but not to less than its amortized carrying value) and income is increased. If the combined fair value of the C&W and NTL common stock increases, our debt obligation increases and income is decreased. The CWC exchangeable notes may be exchanged beginning in July 2002. Genuity Loss In accordance with the provisions of an FCC order in June 2000, Genuity, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of GTE, sold in a public offering 174 million of its Class A common shares, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock and 90.5% of the overall voting equity in Genuity. GTE retained 100% of Genuitys Class B common stock, which currently represents 8.2% of the voting equity in Genuity and contains a contingent conversion feature. A complete description of the circumstances in which the conversion feature can be exercised is included in "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results." In accordance with provisions of the FCC order, the sale transferred ownership and control of Genuity to the Class A common stockholders and, accordingly, we deconsolidated our investment in Genuity on June 30, 2000 and are accounting for our investment in Genuity using the cost method. Our accounting policy concerning the method of accounting applied to investments (consolidation, equity or cost) involves an evaluation of all significant terms of the investments that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the entity in which we have invested. Where control is determined, we consolidate the investment. If we determine that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an entity in which we have invested, we apply the equity method. We apply the cost method in situations where we determine that we do not have significant influence, such as our investment in Genuity. As a result, Genuitys revenues and expenses, as well as changes in balance sheet accounts and cash flows subsequent to June 30, 2000 are no longer included in our consolidated financial results. For comparability, we have adjusted the reported results for all periods prior to June 30, 2000 to exclude the results of Genuity. The after tax losses were $281 million (or $.10 per diluted share) in 2000 and $325 million (or $.12 per diluted share) in 1999. International Restructuring In 2001, we recorded a pretax charge of $672 million ($663 million after tax, or $.24 per diluted share) primarily relating to our investment in CTI, our cellular subsidiary in Argentina. Given the current status of the Argentinean economy, the recent devaluation of the Argentinean peso as well as future economic prospects, including a worsening of the recession, we recorded an estimated loss of $637 million ($637 million after tax, or $.23 per diluted share) based on CTIs current financial position and revised expected results of operations. This loss was an estimation since the Argentinean economy deteriorated very rapidly at year end and is continuing to reflect instability. This estimated loss may not be sufficient when our assessment of the economic impact on CTI, as well as the structure and nature of our continuing involvement in CTI, is completed. We also recorded a loss of $35 million ($26 million after tax, or $.01 per diluted share) related to international losses. In 2000, we recorded a pretax charge of $50 million ($50 million after tax, or $.02 per diluted share) associated with our share of costs incurred at two of our international equity investees to complete employee separation programs. Wireless Joint Venture On April 3, 2000, Verizon and Vodafone consummated the previously announced agreement to combine U.S. wireless and paging operations. In July 2000, following the closing of the Bell Atlantic GTE merger, interests in GTEs U.S. wireless operations were contributed to Verizon Wireless. As a result, Verizon owns an economic interest of 55% and Vodafone owns an economic interest of 45% in the wireless joint venture. Other Charges and Special Items Other charges and special items recorded during 2001 include asset impairments related to property sales and facility consolidation of $151 million ($95 million after tax, or $.03 per diluted share). Other charges and special items recorded during 2000 included the write off of our investment in NorthPoint Communications Corp. (NorthPoint) of $155 million ($153 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted share) as a result of the deterioration in NorthPoints business, operations and financial condition. Other charges and special items in 2000 also included the cost of disposing or abandoning redundant assets and discontinued system development projects in connection with the Bell Atlantic GTE merger of $287 million ($175 million after tax, or $.06 per diluted share), regulatory settlements of $98 million ($61 million after tax, or $.02 per diluted share) and other asset write downs of $416 million ($290 million after tax, or $.11 per diluted share). During 1999, we recorded a special charge of $192 million ($119 million after tax, or $.04 per diluted share) primarily associated with employee separation programs. The charge included separation and related benefits such as outplacement and benefit continuation costs for approximately 3,000 employees. The programs were completed in early April 1999, as planned, consistent with the original cost estimates. Extraordinary Items During 2001, we retired $726 million of debt prior to the stated maturity date, resulting in a pretax extraordinary charge of $29 million ($19 million after tax, or $.01 per diluted share). In June 2000, we entered into a series of definitive sale agreements to resolve service area conflicts prohibited by FCC regulations as a result of the Bell Atlantic GTE merger (see "Sales of Assets, Net Wireless Overlap Sales"). These agreements, which were pursuant to the consent decree issued for the merger, enabled both the formation of Verizon Wireless and the closing of the merger. Since the sales were required by the consent decree and occurred after the merger, the gains on sales were recorded net of taxes as Extraordinary Items in the consolidated statements of income. During the second half of 2000, we completed the sale of the Richmond (former PrimeCo) wireless market to CFW Communications Company in exchange for two wireless rural service areas in Virginia and cash. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $184 million ($112 million after tax, or $.04 per diluted share). In addition, we completed the sales of the consolidated markets in Washington and Texas and unconsolidated interests in Texas (former GTE) to SBC Communications. The sales resulted in a pretax gain of $886 million ($532 million after tax, or $.19 per diluted share). Also, we completed the sale of the San Diego (former GTE) market to AT&T Wireless. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $304 million ($182 million after tax, or $.07 per diluted share). In 2000, we also completed the sale of the Houston (former PrimeCo) wireless overlap market to AT&T Wireless, resulting in a pretax gain of $350 million ($213 million after tax, or $.08 per diluted share). During 2000, we retired $190 million of debt prior to the stated maturity date, resulting in a pretax extraordinary charge of $19 million ($12 million after tax, or less than $.01 per diluted share). During the first quarter of 1999, we repurchased $338 million of high coupon debt through a public tender offer prior to stated maturity, resulting in a pretax extraordinary charge of $46 million ($30 million after tax, or $.01 per diluted share). During the second quarter of 1999, we recorded a pretax extraordinary charge of $10 million ($6 million after tax, or less than $.01 per diluted share) associated with the early extinguishment of debentures of our telephone subsidiaries. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Impact of SFAS No. 133 We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" on January 1, 2001. The impact to Verizon pertains to the recognition of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. Results for the year ended December 31, 2001 include the initial impact of adoption recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $182 million after tax (or $.07 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2001. This cumulative effect charge primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the MFN debt conversion option prior to January 1, 2001. Impact of SAB No. 101 We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000, retroactive to January 1, 2000, as required by the SEC. The impact on our results pertains to the deferral of some non recurring fees, such as service activation and installation fees, and associated incremental direct costs, and the recognition of those revenues and costs over the expected term of the customer relationship. Our 2000 results include the initial impact of adoption recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change of $40 million after tax (or $.01 per diluted share). Our 1999 results have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of the new rules on revenue recognition as a gain of $8 million after tax (or less than $.01 per diluted share), had the rules been effective January 1, 1999. Other Consolidated Results The following discussion of nonoperating items is based on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. Other Income and (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Interest income $ 383 $ 281 $ 101 Foreign exchange gains (losses), net 32 (11) 11 Other, net 34 41 31 Total $ 449 $ 311 $ 143 The changes in other income and expense in 2001, compared to 2000, were primarily due to changes in interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses. We recorded additional interest income in 2001 primarily as a result of interest on several notes receivable, higher average cash balances and the settlement of tax related matters. The change in interest income in 2000, compared to 1999, was the result of higher levels of short term investments, income from our investment in MFNs subordinated debt securities and the favorable settlement of a tax related matter. Foreign exchange gains in 2001 and 2000 were driven primarily by Iusacell, which uses the Mexican peso as its functional currency. Foreign exchange gains or losses are largely associated with the U.S. dollar denominated debt issued by Iusacell. Interest Expense (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Total interest expense $ 3,369 $ 3,490 $ 2,616 Capitalized interest costs 368 230 146 Total interest costs on debt balances $ 3,737 $ 3,720 $ 2,762 Average debt outstanding $ 62,622 $ 51,987 $ 40,821 Effective interest rate 6.0% 7.2% 6.8% The rise in interest costs on debt balances in both 2001 and 2000 was principally due to higher average debt levels. The increase in debt levels for both years was mainly the result of funding for capital expenditures primarily in our Domestic Telecom and Domestic Wireless segments and the debt assumed by Verizon Wireless in connection with the formation of Verizon Wireless. The rise in interest costs in 2001 was partially offset by lower average interest rates. (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Minority interest $ (622) $ (216) $ (159) The increase in minority interest during 2001 compared to 2000 is due to higher earnings at Verizon Wireless and the significant minority interest attributable to Vodafone. The increase in minority interest in 2000 was primarily due to the impact of the wireless joint venture with Vodafone. This increase was partially offset by the redemption in October 1999 and March 2000 of preferred securities issued by our subsidiary GTE Delaware, L.P. and higher operating losses at Iusacell and CTI. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Effective income tax rates 78.7% 39.3% 37.0% The effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before the provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate for 2001 is not consistent with 2000 primarily because tax benefits were not available on many of the losses resulting from the other than temporary decline in market value of several of our investments during 2001. Our reported effective tax rate for 2000 was higher than 1999 primarily due to some merger related costs for which no tax benefits were recorded, the write down of some investments for which no tax benefits were recorded, deferred taxes recorded in connection with the contribution of GTE Wireless assets to Verizon Wireless and higher state income taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for each period is included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Consolidated Financial Condition (dollars in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating activities $ 19,773 $ 15,827 $ 17,017 Investing activities (21,626) (16,055) (17,420) Financing activities 2,075 (1,048) 1,732 Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 222 $ (1,276) $ 1,329 We use the net cash generated from our operations and from external financing to fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization, pay dividends, and invest in new businesses. While current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000, our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from readily available external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements. We expect that capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Additional debt or equity financing will be needed to fund additional development activities or to maintain our capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility. Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. In 2001, the increase in cash from operations compared to 2000 primarily reflects improved results of operations before gains and losses on asset sales and the mark to market adjustments of financial instruments, which are adjusted in cash from operating activities, partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements. Decreased cash flow from operations during 2000 resulted primarily from the payment of income taxes on the disposition of businesses and assets. See "Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities" for additional information on sales of businesses and assets. Improved cash flows from operations during 1999 resulted from growth in operating income, partially offset by changes in assets and liabilities. In 1999, the change in assets and liabilities largely reflects growth in customer accounts receivable and a reduction in employee benefit obligations primarily due to favorable investment returns and changes in plan provisions and actuarial assumptions. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities Capital expenditures continue to be our primary use of capital resources. We invested approximately $11,480 million in our Domestic Telecom business in 2001, compared to $12,119 million and $10,087 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, to facilitate the introduction of new products and services, enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges and increase the operating efficiency and productivity of the network. We also invested approximately $5,006 million in our Domestic Wireless business in 2001, compared to $4,322 million and $1,497 million, respectively, in 2000 and 1999. The increase in 2001 and 2000 is primarily due to the inclusion of both Vodafone and PrimeCo properties in Verizon Wireless in April 2000, as well as increased capital spending in existing Bell Atlantic and GTE wireless properties. Capital spending is expected to be approximately $15 billion to $16 billion in 2002. We invested $3,142 million in acquisitions and investments in businesses during 2001, including $1,691 million related to wireless licenses purchased in connection with an FCC auction (see "Recent Developments FCC Auction" for additional information), $410 million for additional wireless spectrum purchased from another telecommunications carrier and $194 million in wireless properties. In addition, we invested $497 million to acquire the directory business of TELUS. In 2000, we invested $2,247 million in acquisitions and investments including approximately $715 million in the equity of MFN and $1,028 million in wireless properties. In 1999, we invested $5,219 million in acquisitions and investments including $3,250 million to acquire approximately half of the wireless properties of Ameritech Corporation, $635 million to increase our ownership percentage in Omnitel from 19.7% to 23.1%, $374 million to fully acquire the cellular properties of Frontier Cellular, $200 million in PrimeCo, $366 million for a 40% interest in TELPRI and $120 million for the purchase of the wireless license in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 2001, we received cash proceeds on sales of businesses and assets of $415 million, including cash proceeds of $200 million and $215 million in connection with sales of our Cincinnati and Chicago wireless overlap properties, respectively. In 2000, we received cash proceeds on sales of businesses and assets of $6,794 million, including gross cash proceeds of $4,903 million from the sale of non strategic access lines and $1,464 million from overlap wireless properties, as well as $144 million from the sale of CyberTrust. In 1999, we received cash proceeds on sales of businesses and assets of $1,813 million, including $1,196 million from the sale of a substantial portion of GTE Government Systems and $612 million from the disposition of our remaining investment in Viacom. During 2000, we also invested $975 million in subordinated convertible notes of MFN, in connection with our overall investment in MFN, as well as $45 million in OnePoint Communications Corp. notes. The MFN notes were originally issued to be convertible at our option, upon receipt of necessary government approvals, into MFN common stock at a conversion price of $17 per share (after two for one stock split) or an additional 9.6% of the equity of MFN. This investment completed a portion of our previously announced agreement, as amended, with MFN, which included the acquisition of approximately $350 million of long term capacity in MFNs fiber optic networks, beginning in 1999 through 2002. Of the $350 million, $35 million was paid in November 1999, $105 million was paid in October 2000 and $95 million was paid in 2001, and these amounts are included in net cash provided by operating activities. However, in 2001 we renegotiated several significant terms of our MFN investment and commitments, in connection with a new financing arrangement. We purchased an additional $50 million of subordinated convertible notes, that are convertible into MFN common stock at a conversion price of $.53 per share. This new financing arrangement also repriced $500 million of the subordinated convertible notes purchased in 2000 at a conversion price of $3 per share (from $17 per share). Furthermore, the remaining obligations under the long term capacity agreement of $115 million will be satisfied through purchases in the amount of $90 million in 2002, $10 million in 2003 and 2004, and $5 million in 2005. Our short term investments include principally cash equivalents held in trust accounts for payment of employee benefits. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, we invested $2,002 million, $1,204 million and $1,051 million, respectively, in short term investments, primarily to pre fund health and welfare benefits. Proceeds from the sales of all short term investments, principally for the payment of these benefits, were $1,595 million, $983 million and $954 million in the years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2001, Other, net investing activities include loans to Genuity of $1,150 million. In addition, we received a deposit of $191 million related to a sale of telephone lines, $167 million in connection with CANTVs share repurchase program and proceeds of $515 million related to prior year wireless asset sales. Also, Other, net investing activities include capitalized non network software of $1,250 million, $1,044 million and $923 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The loans to Genuity of $1,150 million are a part of an agreement to provide up to $2.0 billion in financing to Genuity with a maturity of 2005. In addition, under the terms of an investment agreement, Vodafone may require us or Verizon Wireless to purchase up to $20 billion worth of its interest in Verizon Wireless between 2003 and 2007 at its then fair market value. The purchase of up to $10 billion may be required during July 2003 or July 2004 and the remainder during the following years. Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities The net cash proceeds from increases in our total debt during 2001 of $6,064 million was primarily due to the issuance of $7,002 million of long term debt by Verizon Global Funding Corp., partially offset by repayments of $980 million of maturities of corporate long term debt. In addition, Verizon Wireless issued $4,555 million of long term debt and repaid $4,690 million of revolving loans, while Domestic Telecom incurred $2,303 million of long term debt, repaid $573 million of net short term debt and retired $1,430 million of long term debt. In 2000, the net cash proceeds from increases in our total debt of $5,058 million was primarily due to the issuance of $5,500 million of long term notes issued by Verizon Global Funding. The increase in total debt was also attributable to the issuance of $893 million of notes under a medium term note program, $657 million of financing transactions of cellular assets, $398 million of long term bank debt at Verizon Wireless and an increase in other short term borrowings, partially offset by repayments of long term debt. In 1999, we increased our total debt (including capital lease obligations) by approximately $6,592 million, primarily due to the issuance of $4,375 million of long term debt issued by GTE. Our debt balance at December 31, 1999 also included $456 million of additional debt issued by Iusacell in 1999. These factors were partially offset by the use of cash proceeds received from the disposition of our remaining investment in Viacom. The pre funding of employee benefit trusts also contributed to the increase in debt levels in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Additionally, the purchases of shares to fund employee stock option exercises contributed to the increase in debt levels in 2000 and 1999. Our debt to equity ratio was 66.4% at December 31, 2001, compared to 62.4% at December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately $7.9 billion of unused bank lines of credit and $449 million in bank borrowings outstanding. As of December 31, 2001, our telephone and financing subsidiaries had shelf registrations for the issuance of up to $11.9 billion of unsecured debt securities. The debt securities of our telephone and financing subsidiaries continue to be accorded high ratings by primary rating agencies. However, in April 2001, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) revised our credit rating outlook from stable to negative. Moodys cited concern about our ability to complete an initial public offering (IPO) of Verizon Wireless in a timely fashion in order to pay for the anticipated FCC spectrum auction purchases of $8.8 billion (see "Other Factors That May Affect Future Results FCC Auction" for additional information on the current status of the spectrum purchases). A change in an outlook does not necessarily signal a rating downgrade but rather highlights an issue whose final resolution may result in placing a company on review for possible downgrade. As in prior years, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. We determine the appropriateness of the level of our dividend payments on a periodic basis by considering such factors as long term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements, and the expectations of our shareowners. In 2001, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $.385 per share. In the first, third and fourth quarters of 2000, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.385 per share. In the second quarter of 2000, we announced two separate pro rata dividends to ensure that the respective shareowners of Bell Atlantic and GTE received dividends at an appropriate rate. In 1999, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $.385 per share. In 2001 and 2000, common stock repurchases were primarily the result of the two year share buyback program approved by the Board of Directors in March 2000 and repurchase of GTE common stock. In 2001 and 2000, .4 million and 35.1 million Verizon common shares were repurchased, respectively. In January 2002, the Board of Directors approved an extension of the existing buy back program to February 2004. In August 1999, GTE announced the initiation of a share repurchase program to offset shares issued under its employee benefit and dividend reinvestment programs. Under the program, we repurchased approximately 17.7 million shares of GTE common stock in 1999, and completed the program with the purchase of an additional 8.4 million shares valued at approximately $600 million through February 2000. Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001 totaled $979 million, a $222 million increase over cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2000 of $757 million. The December 31, 2000 balance decreased by $1,276 million compared to 1999. This change is primarily attributable to the increase in cash at December 31, 1999 for the anticipated funding requirements in early 2000 for our investment in MFN, which occurred in March 2000. Leasing Arrangements We are the lessor in leveraged and direct financing lease agreements under which commercial aircraft and power generating facilities, which comprise the majority of the portfolio, along with industrial equipment, real estate property, telecommunications and other equipment are leased for remaining terms of 1 to 46 years as of December 31, 2001. Minimum lease payments receivable represent unpaid rentals, less principal and interest on third party nonrecourse debt relating to leveraged lease transactions. Since we have no general liability for this debt, which holds a senior security interest in the leased equipment and rentals, the related principal and interest have been offset against the minimum lease payments receivable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All recourse debt is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments. Additional detail about these items is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term debt $ 51,215 $ 5,787 $ 11,322 $ 10,028 $ 24,078 Capital lease obligations 279 50 113 39 77 Operating leases 5,477 723 1,267 1,261 2,226 Other long term obligations 115 90 20 5 Total contractual cash obligations $ 57,086 $ 6,650 $ 12,722 $ 11,333 $ 26,381 Market Risk We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in equity investment prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies using a variety of derivatives, including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate caps and floors, foreign currency forwards and options, equity options and basis swap agreements. We do not hold derivatives for trading purposes. It is our general policy to enter into interest rate, foreign currency and other derivative transactions only to the extent necessary to achieve our desired objectives in limiting our exposures to the various market risks. Our objectives include maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt to lower borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters and to protect against earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in market conditions. We do not hedge our market risk exposure in a manner that would completely eliminate the effect of changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates on our earnings. While we do not expect that our liquidity and cash flows will be materially affected by these risk management strategies, our net income may be materially affected by market risks associated with the exchangeable notes discussed below. Exchangeable Notes In 1998, we issued exchangeable notes as described in Notes 10 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements and discussed earlier under "Mark to Market Adjustment Financial Instruments." These financial instruments expose us to market risk, including: ... Equity price risk, because the notes are exchangeable into shares that are traded on the open market and routinely fluctuate in value. ... Foreign exchange rate risk, because the notes are exchangeable into shares that are denominated in a foreign currency. ... Interest rate risk, because the notes carry fixed interest rates. Periodically, equity price or foreign exchange rate movements may require us to mark to market the exchangeable note liability to reflect the increase or decrease in the current share price compared to the established exchange price, resulting in a charge or credit to income. The following sensitivity analysis measures the effect on earnings and financial condition due to changes in the underlying share prices of the TCNZ, C&W and NTL stock. ... At December 31, 2001, the exchange price for the TCNZ shares (expressed as American Depositary Receipts) was $44.93. The C&W and NTL notes in the amount of $3,180 million are exchangeable into 128.4 million shares of C&W stock and 24.5 million shares of NTL stock. ... For each $1 increase in the value of the TCNZ shares above the exchange price, our pretax earnings would be reduced by approximately $55 million. Assuming the aggregate value of the C&W and NTL stocks exceeds the value of the debt liability, each $1 increase in the value of the C&W shares (expressed as American Depositary Receipts) or NTL shares would reduce our pretax earnings by approximately $43 million or $24 million, respectively. A subsequent decrease in the value of these shares would correspondingly increase earnings, but not to exceed the amount of any previous reduction in earnings. ... Our cash flows would not be affected by mark to market activity relating to the exchangeable notes. ... If we decide to deliver shares in exchange for the notes, the exchangeable note liability (including any mark to market adjustments) will be eliminated and the investment will be reduced by the fair market value of the related number of shares delivered. Upon settlement, the excess of the liability over the book value of the related shares delivered will be recorded as a gain. We also have the option to settle these liabilities with cash upon exchange. Interest Rate Risk The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our long term debt, interest rate derivatives and exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis did not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.

These investments are subject to changes in the market prices of the securities. As noted earlier, the fair values of our exchangeable notes are also affected by changes in equity price movements. The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our investments and exchangeable notes and provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming a 10% increase or decrease in equity prices.

The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of these entities into U.S. dollars are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2001, our primary translation exposure was to the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, Italian lira, and beginning January 1, 2002, the Euro. We have not hedged our accounting translation exposure to foreign currency fluctuations relative to the carrying value of these investments, except for $167 million in hedges which protect a portion of U.S. dollar debt at Iusacell from foreign currency fluctuations. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, our earnings were affected by foreign currency gains or losses associated with the unhedged portion of U.S. dollar denominated debt at Iusacell. Equity income from our international investments is affected by exchange rate fluctuations when an equity investee has assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the investees functional currency. Several of our equity investees have assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the investees functional currency, such as our investments in Venezuela, Canada, the Philippines and Slovakia. Foreign Exchange Risk The fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and investments accounted for under the cost method are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to offset foreign exchange gains and losses on British pound and Japanese yen denominated debt obligations. The table that follows summarizes the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives, cost investments, and the exchangeable notes as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming a 10% decrease and increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the various currencies to which we are exposed. Our sensitivity analysis does not include potential changes in the value of our international investments accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2001, the carrying value of our equity method international investments totaled approximately $5.7 billion.

The transition of Genuity to a public company was part of a comprehensive proposal filed with the FCC on January 27, 2000, to permit the Bell Atlantic GTE merger to close by addressing regulatory restrictions associated with Verizons ability to provide long distance and Internet related data service offerings that GTE had previously provided to consumers and businesses. In accordance with the provisions of an FCC order, in June 2000 Genuity sold 174 million of its Class A common shares, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock and 90.5% of the overall voting equity in Genuity, in an IPO. GTE retained 100% of Genuitys Class B common stock, which currently represents 8.2% of the voting equity in Genuity, as permitted by the 1996 Act. Our investment also includes a contingent conversion right. Our contingent conversion right currently permits us to increase our ownership interest to as much as 79.6% of the total equity of Genuity, representing 95.1% of Genuitys total voting rights (before giving effect to outstanding options granted to Genuity employees), if we eliminate the applicable restrictions of Section 271 of the 1996 Act as to 100% of the total telephone access lines owned by Bell Atlantic in 1999 in its region. This option expires if we do not eliminate these restrictions within five years of the merger, subject to possible extension. If we eliminate Section 271 restrictions as to 95% of the former Bell Atlantic in region lines, we may require Genuity to reconfigure its operations in one or more former Bell Atlantic in region states where we have not eliminated those restrictions in order to bring those operations into compliance with Section 271. The FCC order also allows us to transfer our Class B common stock to a disposition trustee for sale to one or more third parties once we eliminate Section 271 restrictions on at least 50% of the former Bell Atlantic in region access lines. As of December 31, 2001, we have eliminated Section 271 restrictions as to more than 50% of the former Bell Atlantic in region access lines. The IPO transferred the majority ownership and control of Genuity to the public shareholders and, accordingly, we deconsolidated our investment in Genuity on June 30, 2000. In addition to the transfer, we are also required to adhere to safeguards in the FCCs order that prohibit us from exercising influence over Genuitys operations. Therefore, we are accounting for our investment in Genuity using the cost method. Federal and state regulatory conditions to the merger also included commitments to, among other things, promote competition and the widespread deployment of advanced services while helping to ensure that consumers continue to receive high quality, low cost telephone services. In some cases, there are significant penalties associated with not meeting these commitments. The cost of satisfying these commitments could have a significant impact on net income in future periods. The pretax cost to begin compliance with these conditions was approximately $200 million in 2000 and approximately $300 million in 2001. We expect an impact of $200 million to $300 million in 2002. Recent Developments VERIZON WIRELESS FCC Auction On January 29, 2001, the bidding phase of the FCC reauction of 1.9 GHz C and F block broadband Personal Communications Services spectrum licenses, which began December 12, 2000, officially ended. Verizon Wireless was the winning bidder for 113 licenses. The total price of these licenses was $8,781 million, $1,822 million of which has already been paid. Most of the licenses that were reauctioned relate to spectrum that was previously licensed to NextWave Personal Communications Inc. and NextWave Power Partners Inc. (collectively NextWave), which have appealed to the federal courts the FCCs action canceling NextWaves licenses and reclaiming the spectrum. In a decision on June 22, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCCs cancellation and repossession of NextWaves licenses was unlawful. The FCC sought a stay of the courts decision which was denied. The FCC subsequently reinstated NextWaves licenses, but it has neither returned Verizon Wirelesss payment on the NextWave licenses nor has it acknowledged that the courts decision extinguished Verizon Wirelesss obligation to purchase the licenses. On October 19, 2001 the FCC filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuits decision. On March 4, 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the FCCs petition and agreed to hear the appeal. Timing of Initial Public Offering In November 2001, Verizon Wireless Inc. filed an amended registration statement with the SEC in connection with the proposed IPO of its common stock. Since August 2000, when the Verizon Wireless Inc. registration statement was initially filed with the SEC, we have periodically reiterated that the IPO would occur when market conditions are favorable. Acquisition of Several Dobsons Wireless Operations In November and December 2001, we announced that Verizon Wireless signed definitive agreements to acquire several of Dobson Communications Corporations (Dobson) wireless operations in California, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Arizona. The transactions closed in February 2002. The acquired Dobson properties serve a population of approximately 1.2 million. SALE OF ACCESS LINES In July 2001, we announced that we were exploring the sale of 1.2 million access lines in Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri. In October 2001, we agreed to sell all 675,000 of our switched access telephone lines in Alabama and Missouri to CenturyTel Inc. for $2.2 billion. The sale must be approved by the Missouri public service commission, the FCC and the DOJ. The Alabama public service commission approved the sale in December 2001. We expect to close the sale and transfer our operations to CenturyTel during the second half of 2002. Also in October 2001, we agreed to sell approximately 600,000 access lines in Kentucky to ALLTEL for $1.9 billion. The sale has been approved by the Kentucky public service commission, and remains subject to approval by the FCC and the DOJ. We expect to close the sale and transfer our operations to ALLTEL during the second half of 2002. Regulatory and Competitive Trends COMPETITION AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 We face increasing competition in all areas of our business. The 1996 Act, regulatory and judicial actions and the development of new technologies, products and services have created opportunities for alternative telecommunication service providers, many of which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints. Current and potential competitors in telecommunication services include long distance companies, other local telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, foreign telecommunications providers, electric utilities, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services. Many of these companies have a strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition and may affect our future revenue growth. We are unable to predict definitively the impact that the ongoing changes in the telecommunications industry will ultimately have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. The financial impact will depend on several factors, including the timing, extent and success of competition in our markets, the timing and outcome of various regulatory proceedings and any appeals, and the timing, extent and success of our pursuit of new opportunities resulting from the 1996 Act and technological advances. In Region Long Distance We offer long distance service nationwide, except in those states served by the former Bell Atlantic telephone operations where we have not yet received authority to offer long distance service under the 1996 Act. Under the 1996 Act, our ability to offer in region long distance services in the states where the former Bell Atlantic telephone subsidiaries operate as local exchange carriers is largely dependent on satisfying specified requirements. The requirements include a 14 point "competitive checklist" of steps which we must take to help competitors offer local services through resale, through purchase of unbundled network elements, or by interconnecting their own networks to ours. We must also demonstrate to the FCC that our entry into the in region long distance market would be in the public interest. We now have authority to offer in region long distance service in five states in the former Bell Atlantic territory, accounting for more than half of the lines served by the former Bell Atlantic. In addition to its New York order released in December 1999, the FCC released orders on April 16, 2001, July 23, 2001, September 19, 2001 and February 22, 2002 approving our applications for permission to enter the in region long distance market in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, respectively. Both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania orders are currently on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. We have filed applications with the FCC to offer long distance service in New Jersey and Vermont. We expect the FCC to rule on those applications by March 20, 2002 and April 17, 2002, respectively. We have also filed state applications for support of anticipated applications with the FCC for permission to enter the in region long distance market in New Hampshire, Maine and Delaware. Third party testing of our operations support systems is in its final stages in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES Our telephone operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to interstate services and related matters. In 2001, the FCC continued to implement reforms to the interstate access charge system and to implement the "universal service" and other requirements of the 1996 Act. Access Charges and Universal Service On May 31, 2000, the FCC adopted the CALLS plan as a comprehensive five year plan for regulation of interstate access charges. The CALLS plan has three main components. First, it establishes a portable interstate access universal service support of $650 million for the industry. This explicit support replaces implicit support embedded in interstate access charges. Second, the plan simplifies the patchwork of common line charges into one subscriber line charge (SLC) and provides for de averaging of the SLC by zones and class of customers in a manner that will not undermine comparable and affordable universal service. Third, the plan sets into place a mechanism to transition to a set target of $.0055 per minute for switched access services. Once that target rate is reached, local exchange carriers are no longer required to make further annual price cap reductions to their switched access prices. The annual reductions leading to the target rate, as well as annual reductions for the subset of special access services that remain subject to price cap regulation was set at 6.5% per year. On September 10, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled on an appeal of the FCC order adopting the plan. The court upheld the FCC on several challenges to the order, but remanded two aspects of the decision back to the FCC on the grounds that they lacked sufficient justification. The court remanded back to the FCC for further consideration its decision setting the annual reduction factor at 6.5% and the size of the new universal service fund at $650 million. The entire plan (including these elements) will continue in effect pending the FCCs further consideration of its justification of these components. As a result of tariff adjustments which became effective in July 2001, approximately 80% of our access lines reached the $0.0055 benchmark. The FCC has adopted rules for special access services that provide for pricing flexibility and ultimately the removal of services from price regulation when prescribed competitive thresholds are met. In order to use these rules, carriers must forego the ability to take advantage of provisions in the current rules that provide relief in the event earnings fall below prescribed thresholds. In 2001 we were authorized to remove special access and dedicated transport services from price caps in 35 of the 57 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the former Bell Atlantic territory and in three additional MSAs in the former GTE territory. In addition, the FCC found that in 10 MSAs we have met the stricter standards to remove special access connections to end user customers from price caps. We have an application pending that, if granted, would remove special access services from price cap regulation in 16 additional MSAs. In November 1999, the FCC adopted a new mechanism for providing universal service support to high cost areas served by large local telephone companies. This funding mechanism provides additional support for local telephone services in several states served by our telephone operations. This system has been supplemented by the new FCC access charge plan described above. On July 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed and remanded to the FCC for further proceedings. The court concluded that the FCC had failed to adequately explain some aspects of its decision and had failed to address any need for a state universal service mechanism. The current universal service mechanism remains in place pending the outcome of any FCC review as a result of these appeals. Unbundling of Network Elements In November 1999, the FCC announced its decision setting forth new unbundling requirements, eliminating elements that it had previously required to be unbundled, limiting the obligation to provide others and adding new elements. Appeals from this decision are pending. In addition to the unbundling requirements released in November 1999, the FCC released an order in a separate proceeding in December 1999, requiring incumbent local exchange companies also to unbundle and provide to competitors the higher frequency portion of their local loop. This provides competitors with the ability to provision data services on top of incumbent carriers voice services. Appeals from this order are also pending. In July 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that some aspects of the FCCs requirements for pricing UNEs were inconsistent with the 1996 Act. In particular, it found that the FCC was wrong to require incumbent carriers to base these prices not on their real costs but on the imaginary costs of the most efficient equipment and the most efficient network configuration. This portion of the courts decision has been stayed pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, the court upheld the FCCs decision that UNEs should be priced based on a forward looking cost model rather than historical costs. The U.S. Supreme Court currently has this case under review. In December 2001, the FCC opened its triennial review of unbundled network elements. This rulemaking reopens the question of what network elements must be made available on an unbundled basis under the 1996 Act and will revisit the unbundling decisions described above. In this rulemaking, the FCC also will address other pending issues relating to unbundled elements, including the question of whether competing carriers may substitute combinations of unbundled loops and transport for already competitive special access services. Compensation for Internet Traffic On April 27, 2001, the FCC released an order addressing intercarrier compensation for dial up connections for Internet bound traffic. The FCC found that Internet bound traffic is interstate and subject to the FCCs jurisdiction. Moreover, the FCC again found that Internet bound traffic is not subject to reciprocal compensation under Section 251(b)(5) of the 1996 Act. Instead, the FCC established federal rates for this traffic that decline from $0.0015 to $0.0007 over a three year period. The FCC order also sets caps on the total minutes of this traffic that may be subject to any intercarrier compensation and requires that incumbent local exchange carriers must offer to pay reciprocal compensation for local traffic at the same rate as they are required to pay on Internet bound traffic. Several competing carriers and state regulators appealed this order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The court denied a motion to stay the FCC order, and the order went into effect. The appeal remains pending. STATE REGULATION On January 28, 2002, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order mandating reductions in the rates that Verizon New York Inc. may charge its local exchange competitors for access to unbundled network elements. Assuming current volumes, the revenue impact of the reductions is estimated to be $200 million per year, although this amount may change if volumes change. Verizon New York has separately been involved in proceedings before the New York Public Service Commission relating to an alternative regulation plan to replace and succeed the current Performance Regulation Plan, put in place in 1995. Under the new two year plan, Verizon New York would be permitted to exercise rate flexibility up to 3% of its total intrastate revenues annually, or approximately $160 million. Other Matters Recent Accounting Pronouncements Business Combinations In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," which applies to business combinations occurring after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used and includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the combination. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets must be reviewed annually (or more frequently under various conditions) for impairment in accordance with this statement. This impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The goodwill impairment test under SFAS No. 142 requires a two step approach, which is performed at the reporting unit level, as defined in SFAS No. 142. Step one identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. Step two, which is only performed if there is a potential impairment, compares the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to its implied value, as defined in SFAS No. 142. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to that excess. The amortization of goodwill included in our investments in equity investees is no longer recorded in accordance with the new rules. Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." The initial impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of 2002 resulting in a charge of $496 million, net of tax. This charge is comprised of $204 million ($203 million after tax) for goodwill and $294 million ($293 million after tax) for wireless licenses and goodwill of equity method investments and for other intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, on January 1, 2002 we ceased amortizing existing goodwill (including goodwill recorded on our equity investments), acquired workforce intangible assets and wireless licenses which we determined have an indefinite life (see discussion below). Wireless Licenses In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we have reassessed the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets. A significant portion of our intangible assets are licenses, including licenses associated with equity method investments, that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide cellular communication services. While licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the Federal Communications Commission. Renewals of licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. As a result, the wireless licenses will be treated as an indefinite lived intangible asset under the provisions of SFAS No. 142 and will not be amortized but rather will be tested for impairment. We will reevaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Previous wireless business combinations have been for the purpose of acquiring existing licenses and related infrastructure to enable us to build out our existing nationwide wireless network. The primary asset acquired in such combinations has been wireless licenses. In the allocation of the purchase price of these previous acquisitions, amounts classified as goodwill have related predominately to the expected synergies of placing the acquired licenses in our national footprint. Further, in purchase accounting, the values assigned to both wireless licenses and goodwill were principally determined based on an allocation of the excess of the purchase price over the other acquired net assets. We believe that the nature of our wireless licenses and related goodwill are fundamentally indistinguishable. In light of these considerations, on January 1, 2002, amounts previously classified as goodwill, approximately $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001, were reclassified into wireless licenses. Also, assembled workforce, previously included in other intangible assets, will no longer be recognized separately from wireless licenses. Amounts for 2001, 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted on January 1, 2002. In conjunction with this reclassification, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," we have recognized in the first quarter of 2002 a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.6 billion related to the difference in the tax basis versus book basis of the wireless licenses. This reclassification, including the related impact on deferred taxes, had no impact on our results of operations. This reclassification and the methodology to be subsequently used to test wireless licenses for impairment under SFAS No. 142 as described in the next paragraph have been reviewed with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. When testing the carrying value of the wireless licenses for impairment, we will determine the fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses by subtracting from wireless operations discounted cash flows the fair value of all of the other net tangible and intangible assets of our wireless operations. If the fair value of the aggregated wireless licenses as determined above is less than the aggregated carrying amount of the licenses, an impairment will be recognized. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, a test for impairment of wireless licenses was performed with no impairment recognized. Future tests for impairment will be performed at least annually and more often if events or circumstances warrant. Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This standard provides the accounting for the cost of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that companies recognize the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which the obligations are incurred and capitalize that amount as a part of the book value of the long lived asset. That cost is then depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying long lived asset. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations or financial position. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144. This standard supersedes SFAS No. 121 and the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale and addresses several SFAS No. 121 implementation issues. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
