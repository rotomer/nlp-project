Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Walgreens is engaged in the retail sale of prescription and nonprescription drugs and general merchandise. General merchandise includes, among other things, cosmetics, toiletries, household items, food, beverages, and photofinishing. Customers can have prescriptions filled at the drugstore counter, as well as through the mail, by telephone, and on the Internet. The total number of drugstores (including three mail service facilities) at August 31, 2004, was 4,582 located in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The drugstore industry is highly competitive. In addition to other drugstore chains, independent drugstores, mail order prescription providers and Internet pharmacies, we also compete with various other retailers including grocery stores, mass merchants and dollar stores. The long term outlook for prescription sales is strong due in part to the aging population, as well as the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs. Although the effect of the new Medicare prescription drug legislation on retail pharmacy is difficult to fully ascertain at this time, we are experiencing additional prescription sales as a result of the new senior discount cards; however, gross margin rates on these sales are lower. As an efficient provider, we feel we are positioned well for these industry developments. We continue with expansion into new markets and increased penetration in existing markets. We believe we are well staffed with pharmacists for both current demands and future growth, with only select market needs. Restatement and Reclassification of Financial Statements As disclosed in our March 21, 2005 Form 8 K, we recorded a non cash correction of lease accounting errors. These adjustments conform the accounting for leases to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as described in a recent letter issued by the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we do not believe that these errors resulted in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements for any annual or interim period previously reported, the effect of correcting the cumulative impact of the errors in the current quarter would have had a material effect on the current quarter and fiscal year results. Historically, when accounting for leases, we recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the firm term of the lease, with the term commencing when actual rent payments began. Depreciation of buildings on leased land occurred over a period that may have included both the firm term of the lease as well as certain option periods. We have revised our accounting such that the commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date we become legally obligated to make rent payments or the date we have the right to control the property. Additionally, we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over a time period that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation of buildings on leased land. As a result, we have restated our consolidated statements of earnings and balance sheets for the periods presented. Refer to Restatement Note on pages 29 and 30. The following discussion of Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources reflect those restatements. Additionally, auction rate securities of $1,251.5 million which were previously classified as cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2004 have been reclassified as short term investments available for sale. The cash flows related to these investments are now disclosed as investing activities in the companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Net earnings were $1.350 billion, or $1.31 per share (diluted), an increase of 15.9% from last years earnings of $1.165 billion, or $1.13 per share (diluted). Net earnings increases resulted from improved sales and gross profit ratios partially offset by higher expense ratios. Included in this years results was a $16.3 million pre tax gain ($.010 per share) from the receipt of litigation settlements. Last years results included $29.6 million ($.018 per share) of comparable receipts. Excluding these gains, fiscal year earnings rose 16.8%. Net sales increased by 15.4% to $37.5 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to increases of 13.3% in 2003 and 16.5% in 2002. Drugstore sales increases resulted from sales gains in existing stores and added sales from new stores, each of which include an indeterminate amount of market driven price changes. Sales in comparable drugstore (those open at least one year) were up 10.9% in 2004, 8.6% in 2003 and 10.5% in 2002. The company operated 4,582 drugstores as of August 31, 2004, compared to 4,227 as of August 31, 2003 and 3,883 at August 31, 2002. Prescription sales increased 17.8% in 2004, 17.4% in 2003 and 21.2% in 2002. Comparable drugstore prescription sales were up 14.0% in 2004, 13.2% in 2003 and 16.3% in 2002. Prescription sales were 63.2% of total sales for fiscal 2004 compared to 62.0% in 2003 and 59.8% in 2002. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.2% for fiscal 2004, 2.1% for 2003 and 1.5% for 2002. The shift of Prilosec in September 2003 to over the counter status and its related effect on Omeprazole (generic Prilosec) also reduced prescription sales. Similarly, the shift of Claritin in December 2002 from prescription to over the counter status reduced prescription sales. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations as well as government and private insurance, were 91.7% of pharmacy sales in 2004, 90.6% in 2003 and 89.8% in 2002. Non prescription (front end) sales increased 11.7% in 2004, 7.5% in 2003 and 10.1% in 2002, primarily driven by improved customer counts. Front end sales were 36.5% of total sales in fiscal 2004, 37.8% in 2003 and 39.8% in 2002. Gross margins as a percent of total sales were 27.2% in 2004, 27.1% in 2003 and 26.5% in 2002. Both prescription and front end margins increased in fiscal 2004. Prescription margins increased primarily because of higher generic drug utilization. Partially offsetting these increases was the shift in sales mix toward prescriptions, which carry a lower margin than front end merchandise. In addition, third party sales, which typically have lower profit margins than cash prescriptions, continue to become a larger portion of prescription sales. Non prescription margins increased due to our sales mix moving to higher margin categories, especially digital film processing. Contributing to the fiscal 2003 increase was the shift in vendor allowances from advertising to cost of sales. As of January 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor." The impact of EITF Issue No. 02 16 in fiscal 2003 resulted in an increase to advertising costs of $75.0 million (.23% of total sales), a reduction to cost of sales of $56.2 million (.17% of total sales), and a reduction to pre tax earnings and inventory of $18.8 million. We use the last in, first out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation. The LIFO provision is dependent upon inventory levels, inflation rates and merchandise mix. The effective LIFO inflation rates were .14% in 2004, .84% in 2003 and 1.42% in 2002, which resulted in charges to cost of sales of $6.7 million in 2004, $36.2 million in 2003 and $55.9 million in 2002. Inflation on prescription inventory was .7% in 2004, 3.8% in 2003 and 4.3% in 2002. In all three fiscal years, we experienced some deflation in non prescription inventories. Selling, occupancy and administration expenses were 21.5% of sales in fiscal 2004, 21.4% in fiscal 2003 and 20.9% in fiscal 2002. The increase in fiscal 2004, as a percent to sales, was caused by higher advertising costs as well as costs associated with our ongoing conversion from analog to digital photo labs. Lower sales as a result of new generic drugs also increased expense ratios in 2004 and 2003. In addition, fiscal 2003 was affected by the shift in vendor allowances from advertising to cost of sales, as well as higher store salaries and occupancy as a percent to sales. Interest income increased in 2004 principally due to higher investment levels. Average net investment levels were approximately $1.281 billion in 2004, $631 million in 2003 and $162 million in 2002. The effective income tax rate was 37.5% for fiscal 2004 and 37.75% for both 2003 and 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from these judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future statements. Some of the more significant estimates include liability for closed locations, liability for insurance claims, vendor allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts and cost of sales. We use the following techniques to determine estimates: Liability for closed locations The present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. Liability for insurance claims Provisions for these losses are recorded based upon estimates for claims incurred. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. Vendor allowances Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchase levels, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, occupancy and administration expense to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Allowance for doubtful accounts Based on both specific receivables and historic write off percentages. Cost of sales Primarily derived based upon point of sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventories. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $444.0 million at August 31, 2004, compared to $1.268 billion at August 31, 2003. Short term investment objectives are to minimize risk, maintain liquidity and maximize after tax yields. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in top tier money market funds and commercial paper. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.644 billion in fiscal 2004 and $1.503 billion in fiscal 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings, partially offset by higher accounts receivables that were affected by the timing of payment cycles. Our profitability is the principal source of funds for expansion and remodeling programs, dividends to shareholders, the stock repurchase program and various technological improvements. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.166 billion versus $700.8 million last year. Investments in auction rate securities net of redemptions used $1.244 billion over last year for the twelve month period. We actively invest in municipal bonds and student obligations and purchase these securities at par. While the underlying security is issued as a long term investment, they typically can be purchased and sold every 7, 28 and 35 days. The trading of auction rate securities takes place through a dutch auction with an interest rate reset at the beginning of each holding period. At the end of each holding period the interest is paid to the investor. Additions to property and equipment were $939.5 million compared to $795.1 million last year. There were 446 new or relocated stores, including seven home medical centers, three home infusion centers and two clinical pharmacies opened during the year. This compared to 439 last year, which included nine home medical centers and two clinical phar macies. New stores are owned or leased. There were 46 owned locations opened during the year and 63 under construction at August 31, 2004, versus 54 owned and 43 under construction as of August 31, 2003. During the year, a new distribution center opened in Moreno Valley, California. Last year, a distribution center was opened in Perrysburg, Ohio. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Stores are expected to be 47% of this total, distribution 15%, store technology 26% and other projects 12%. We expect to open about 450 new stores in fiscal 2005, with a net increase of approximately 365 stores, and anticipate having a total of 7,000 drugstores by the year 2010. We are continuing to relocate stores to more convenient and profitable freestanding locations. In addition to new stores, expenditures are planned for technology and distribution centers. A new distribution center is planned for South Carolina with an anticipated opening date in 2007. Net cash used for financing activities was $302.1 million compared to $222.1 million last year. On July 14, 2004, the Board of Directors announced a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion, which we plan to execute over the next four years. During fiscal 2004 we purchased $21.9 million of company shares related to the stock repurchase program. An additional $277.3 million of shares were purchased to support the long term needs of the employee stock plans, which compares to similar purchases of $149.2 million last year. This year we had proceeds related to employee stock plans of $145.1 million versus $82.0 million last year. There were no new borrowings or outstanding borrowings during either period. At August 31, 2004, we had a syndicated bank line of credit facility of $200 million to support our short term commercial paper program. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2004 (In Millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Over 5 Years Operating leases* $21,692.7 $1,279.8 $2,606.1 $2,425.3 $15,381.5 Purchase obligations: Open inventory purchase orders* 770.0 770.0 Real estate development* 378.4 378.4 Other corporate obligations* 84.4 44.6 39.8 Insurance 353.3 130.2 119.0 68.7 35.4 Retiree health & life 204.5 7.1 14.6 19.2 163.6 Closed location obligations 77.6 19.4 28.1 16.8 13.3 Long term debt 14.7 2.3 9.7 0.6 2.1 Capital lease obligations 36.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 30.0 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 160.6 12.3 11.4 17.7 119.2 Total $23,772.2 $2,646.1 $2,830.7 $2,550.3 $15,745.1 * Not on balance sheet. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Letters of credit are issued to support purchase obligations and commitments (as reflected on the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table) as follows (In Millions): Inventory obligations $ 77.2 Real estate development 1.6 Insurance 156.2 Total $235.0 We have no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed on the previous Contractual Obligations and Commitments table. Both on and off balance sheet financing are considered when targeting debt to equity ratios to balance the interest of equity and debt (real estate) investors. This balance allows us to lower our cost of capital while maintaining a prudent level of financial risk. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03 10, "Application of EITF Issue No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers," which will be effective in fiscal year 2005. We are already in conformity with this new pronouncement; therefore, the implementation will not impact the financial statements. In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106," to include additional disclosures. The interim disclosure requirements were presented in our fiscal year 2004 third quarter statements. The annual disclosure requirements are reflected in our fiscal 2004 annual financial statements. (See Note "Retirement Benefits" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvements and Modernization Act of 2003." This statement requires the company to disclose the effects of the Act and to assess the impact of the subsidy on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. The effective date for the company is the quarter ending November 30, 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Act on our postretirement benefit plan.
