Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Overview: Sales grew by 8% in 2003 and by 4% in 2002. Excluding currency effects, sales remained flat in 2003 and grew 2% in 2002. In 2003, HPLC and thermal analysis sales grew by approximately 5% and 11%, respectively, while MS declined approximately 18% excluding the Inorganic business, which was sold in March 2003. Operating income for 2003 and 2002 was $219.2 million and $196.4 million, respectively. The increase of $22.8 million or 12% for the year is primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit, a decrease in litigation provisions from $7.9 million to $1.5 million and a decrease in restructuring and other unusual charges, net associated with the integration of the worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service and support organizations from $7.4 million to $0.9 million. In addition, in 2002 the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of a long lived asset, for which there was no such charge in 2003. Offsetting the increase in operating income is the loss on sale of the inorganic MS product line of $5.0 million, a charge for the expensed in process research and development of $6.0 million and increased research and development expenses relating to acquisitions and the Companys continued commitment to invest significantly in new product development and existing product enhancements. The Company completed the $200 million stock repurchase program during 2003 by purchasing $100.6 million of the Companys common stock. On May 6, 2003 the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $400 million in outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company believes that the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding number of shares through open market purchases. The Company believes it has the resources to fund this effort as well as to meet on going operational cash flow needs and pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. As of December 31, 2003, 7,540 shares had been purchased under the 2003 plan for $224.0 million. In the aggregate, the Company repurchased 11,939 shares of its common stock for $324.6 million during 2003. The Company had net borrowings at the end of 2003 of $246.3 million, primarily relating to borrowings in the U.S. under the Companys credit facility and term loan facility for the stock repurchases. In April 2003, the Company paid $53.7 million for damages and interest relating to the Applera patent litigation. Similar claims have been asserted against the Company in other countries and there is a possibility that claims may be made with respect to other products in the MS line. During 2003, approximately 55% of the Companys combined net sales were derived from operations outside the United States. The Company believes that the geographic diversity of its sales reduces its dependence on any particular region. The U.S. dollar value of these revenues varies with currency exchange fluctuations, and such fluctuations can affect the Companys results from period to period. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 (The Company has included references to the Notes of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.) Net Sales: Net sales for 2003 were $958.2 million and were an increase of 8% compared to $890.0 million for 2002. Excluding the favorable currency effects, net sales remained essentially flat over 2002. In 2003, product sales increased $25.9 million or 4% and service sales increased $42.4 million or 22% over sales in 2002. With respect to the Companys performance by product line (excluding the effects of currency translation), HPLC sales overall grew approximately 5%. In 2003, HPLC chemistry grew 11% primarily as a result of continued strength in sales related to pharmaceutical production. HPLC service sales grew 14% over 14 Table of Contents 2002 due to increased sales of service plans to our growing installed base of customers. Growth in chemistry and service were offset by a decline of 1% in instrument sales during 2003. The decline in instrument sales is largely attributable to a combination of postponements and delays in purchase decisions for such instruments by the Companys customers for new and replacement products. For the HPLC business, service revenue was approximately 27% of total HPLC revenue in 2003 compared to 25% of revenue in 2002. The growth of service revenue was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand from large multi national customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography consumables account for approximately 19% of overall HPLC sales and grew by approximately 11% in 2003. Chromatography consumable growth was driven by increased utilization of existing HPLC equipment and by the successful launch of a new line of chromatography columns and sample preparation devices. Geographically, the strongest growth areas of the world for HPLC in 2003 were Asia, Japan and Eastern Europe, achieving 16%, 10% and 40% growth, respectively. The U.S. grew modestly at 2%, while Europe experienced a decline of 4%. Sales growth in Asian and Eastern European geographies is related to economic modernization and development of basic infrastructure. Japan continues to be a robust market as Waters continues to offer Japanese language software products that meet local needs. Markets in the U.S. and Europe languished in 2003 as we saw a continuation of delays in instrument replacements early in the year at many of our pharmaceutical customers. MS sales declined approximately 18% in 2003, excluding the impact of the sale of the inorganic product line. The decline in sales over 2002 was across most geographic areas, primarily due to the impact of the Applera patent litigation, reduced MS instrument prices and a decline in pharmaceutical capital spending. Sales to customers working on proteomics applications in the pharmaceutical industry, government and academic sector and biotech all experienced declines in instrument purchases in 2003. We believe that our sales decline is a result of a temporary market decline in 2003 as well as a loss of market share to competing technologies that resulted in the overall 18% sales decline in MS. Service revenue for the MS product line accounted for approximately 19% of total MS revenue in 2003 compared to 12% in 2002, and grew approximately 27% during this period. The growth in MS service revenue as a percentage of overall MS revenue was primarily due to the decline in MS instrument revenue, which is attributed to reduced demand from proteomics customers. Sales for thermal analysis products grew 20% in 2003, excluding the impact of the acquired rheology business. The growth of this business is geographically broad based with increased spending by core industrial chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The impact of sales in 2003 from the rheology business acquisition added an additional 16% to the thermal analysis business growth. TAI service revenue was approximately 26% of total TAI revenue. Compared to 2002, TAI service revenue grew by approximately 41% primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments and the Rheometrics acquisition. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2003 was $560.4 million compared to $516.5 million for 2002, an increase of $43.9 million or 8%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.5% in 2003 from 58.0% in 2002. The increase in gross profit of 8% is generally linear with the net sales increase of 8% which is mostly attributed to favorable foreign exchange in 2003. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general, and administrative expenses for 2003 and 2002 were $264.3 million and $246.8 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 27.6% for 2003 compared to 27.7% for 2002. The $17.4 million or 7% increase in total selling, general and administrative expenses for 2003 included an increase of approximately $17.7 million as a result of currency translation, offset by a reduction in operating expenses of $0.3 million. The reduction in operating expenses includes cost savings of $4.5 million from the recently completed HPLC and MS field sales and service integration efforts, generating lower headcount and labor costs, associated fringe benefits and travel costs. These reductions were offset by annual merit increases across most divisions and other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs associated with the 2003 acquisitions totaling approximately 15 Table of Contents $4.2 million. The Company experienced realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains of approximately $2.2 million in 2003 compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2002, an increase of $3.0 million. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $59.2 million for 2003 and $51.9 million for 2002, an increase of $7.3 million or 14%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to acquisitions, specifically Creon and Rheometrics, and to the Companys continued commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and improved HPLC, MS, thermal analysis and rheology products. In addition, the Company incurred contract research and development costs of $1.8 million related to new product development efforts for the Q Tof product line. Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles Amortization: Purchased intangibles amortization for 2003 was $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million for 2002, an increase of $0.6 million or 18%. The increase primarily relates to amortization associated with the intangible assets purchased as part of the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions. Litigation Provisions: Litigation provision for 2003 was $1.5 million compared to $7.9 million for 2002. The Company recorded $1.5 million and $5.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to an environmental matter concerning the Companys Taunton facility (Note 13). In 2002, the Company recorded $2.8 million for the Applera patent litigation (Note 12) for liabilities associated with product sales made prior to the day of the unfavorable jurys verdict in March 2002. Loss on Sale of Business: The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the loss on the sale (Note 8) of the inorganic MS product line in 2003. There was no such charge in 2002. Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Variagenics, as the technology collaboration program was discontinued (Note 5). There was no such charge in 2003. Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net: The Company recorded $2.6 million in 2003 and $7.4 million in 2002 for restructuring and other directly related incremental costs relating to its integration of the worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service, manufacturing and support organizations. The charge in 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor terminations and other directly related incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge in 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people, contract cancellation fees, non cancelable lease obligations and other directly related incremental costs. During 2003, the Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to distribution and facility settlements being less than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees previously selected for employment termination. There were no such reversals in 2002. The Company has included in the consolidated balance sheet in other long term liabilities approximately $1.1 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for non cancelable lease obligations with a portion to be paid out extending to 2012. The remaining $1.5 million and $3.7 million of the liability is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 16 Table of Contents The following is a rollforward of the Companys HPLC and MS integration restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2002 Charges Utilization Reversals 2003 Severance $ 1,655 $ 1,553 $ (2,672 ) $ (505 ) $ 31 Facilities 2,388 (60 ) (391 ) 1,937 Distributor terminations 1,350 400 (325 ) (950 ) 475 Other 78 661 (568 ) (8 ) 163 Total $ 5,471 $ 2,614 $ (3,625 ) $ (1,854 ) $ 2,606 The amount of expected annual cost savings is approximately $6.0 million. The Company began realizing savings of approximately $1.5 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter of 2003. The Company believes that there were no material increases in other expenses or reductions in revenues as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost savings is comprised of head count reductions of approximately $4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility closures of approximately $0.2 million. The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision of $0.1 million at its TAI subsidiary for severance and other related costs in 2003. There were no such charges in 2002. Expensed In Process Research and Development: In connection with the acquisition of Creon, the Company wrote off the fair value of purchased in process research and development (IPR&D) of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and had no alternative future uses. As of the acquisition date, there were four projects that met the above criteria. The significant IPR&D projects identified consist of the E Lab notebook and the automatic LC MS dereplication system. The IPR&D charges associated with these projects were $4.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Management determined the valuation of the IPR&D using a number of factors, including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This valuation included consideration of (i) the stage of completion of each of the projects, (ii) the technological feasibility of each of the projects, (iii) whether the projects had an alternative future use, and (iv) the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product has met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. As of the acquisition date, none of the IPR&D projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. In assessing the technological feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome. As of the acquisition date, the Company estimated the E Lab notebook to be 90% complete and the automatic LC MS dereplication system to be 85% complete. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from 55% to 60% per annum, depending on the projects stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased IPR&D resulted in a total valuation of $6.0 million. Although work on the projects related to the IPR&D continued after the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was written 17 Table of Contents off because the projects underlying the IPR&D that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2003, the IPR&D projects still had not reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining costs to complete these projects are not considered material to the Company and there are currently no expected material variations between projected results from the projects versus those at the time of the acquisition. The Company expects the projects to be completed within the next twelve months. Other Income (Expense), Net: In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $0.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in pre tax charges for other than temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments, including investments in GeneProt and Variagenics (Note 5). During 2002, the Company recorded a $1.0 million charge to other income (expense), in the consolidated statements of operations, for an other than temporary impairment of the equity investment and warrants resulting from Variagenics public stock price declines that the Company believes reflected the lack of profitable operations and a capital market that had little liquidity for small biotech companies. In addition, in 2002, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $12.6 million to other income (expense) for an other than temporary impairment of its investment in GeneProt. This charge was recorded because to the Companys knowledge, GeneProt had been unable to generate enough commercial interest to expand its business in the U.S. market. Additionally, during 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a $0.3 million and $0.1 million charge, respectively, to other income (expense) for the impairment of certain other equity investments. The impairment charges in 2002, were offset by a $7.7 million termination fee received from GeneProt for cancellation of its $20.0 million order. There were no such off setting charges in 2003. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total interest expense in 2003 was offset by a $0.9 million reduction in an interest expense estimate relating to the calculation of interest expense for the Applera litigation paid in April 2003 (Note 12). Excluding this reduction, interest expense for 2003 would have been $3.3 million, or an increase of 32%. This increase primarily relates to interest expense on borrowings against the Companys credit facility to fund the stock repurchase program (Note 10). In 2002, the interest expense primarily related to accrued post judgment interest associated with the Applera litigation. Interest Income: Interest income for 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The decline in interest income is primarily due to lower yields and lower cash balances in the United Kingdom. Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective income tax rate was 23.6% in 2003 and 22.1% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate increased primarily due to lower effective tax rates on special charges and the expensed in process research and development charge related to the Creon acquisition of $6.0 million not being tax deductible under German statutory law. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle: In 2002, the method of accounting for patent related costs associated with patent litigation was changed effective January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated remaining economic life to expensing the costs as incurred. The Company believes that this change is preferable because it will provide a better comparison with the Companys industry peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred. The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is included as a charge to net income for 2002. There were no such changes for 2003. 18 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net Sales: Net sales for 2002 were $890.0 million and were an increase of 4% compared to $859.2 million for 2001. Excluding the favorable effects of a weaker U.S. dollar, 2002 net sales increased by 2% over 2001. Product line sales growth in 2002 before the effects of currency was 7% for HPLC and 3% for TAI, offset by an 8% decline for MS. Sales grew by 4% in 2002 and by 8% in 2001. Excluding currency effects, sales grew 2% in 2002 and 10% in 2001. Sales growth, before currency effects, in both years reflected increased customer demand for new products. In both years, sales growth was primarily driven by a combination of the replacement of existing instruments, increased service revenues from a larger installed instrument base and the sales of new instruments and consumables to customers to address their increased sample testing needs. In addition, sales growth before currency effects in 2001 reflected increased demand for new MS products such as the Q Tof UltimaTM used in drug and life science research. In 2002, Waters growth was driven primarily by improved HPLC instrument sales outside of the United States and increased global demand for HPLC consumables and services. HPLC instrument sales outside of the United States were driven by new AllianceTM HPLC configurations introduced in early 2002. Product line sales growth in 2002 before the effects of currency was 7% for HPLC, offset by a decline of 8% for MS, and growth of 3% for TAI. Sales for MS systems were adversely impacted by the effect of on going patent litigation in the United States. As a result of this litigation, the Company withdrew the Quattro UltimaTM triple quadrupole MS and versions of the Q Tof UltimaTM, configurations from the US market effective mid March 2002. The Company estimates that total MS sales in 2002 were reduced by approximately $35 million as a result of this litigation. Sales of high performance triple quadrupole instruments (Quattro UltimaTM and its predecessor) in the United States in 2001 were approximately $20 million. The Q Tof UltimaTM was first shipped in mid 2001 and 2001 sales in the United States were approximately $20 million. Sales growth for HPLC was driven by relatively healthy life science and pharmaceutical demand in Europe and new business associated with recent economic modernization in Eastern Europe. However, this growth was somewhat offset by flat sales growth in the United States. The weakness in demand experienced in the United States was primarily related to reduced order volume from large pharmaceutical accounts during the fourth quarter. TAIs sales growth was largely due to the success of its newly introduced Q SeriesTM differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) systems and thermal gravimetric analysis systems (TGA). For the HPLC business, service revenue grew 19% in 2002 and was approximately 25% of total HPLC revenue in 2002 compared to 23% of revenue in 2001. The growth of service revenue was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand from large multi national customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography consumables account for approximately 18% of overall HPLC sales and grew by approximately 1% in 2002. However, the consumables business in 2001 included a bulk media chromatography supply contract that terminated in early 2002. The growth of the chromatography business, without considering sales of this bulk media in the prior year, was approximately 10%. Chromatography consumable growth was driven by increased utilization of existing HPLC equipment and by the successful launch of a new line of chromatography columns and sample preparation devices. The Companys MS product line was affected in the U.S. by the March 2002 unfavorable patent litigation ruling involving sales of certain MS products. Service revenue accounted for approximately 17% of total MS revenue in 2002 compared to 15% in 2001, and grew approximately 11% during this period. The growth in MS service revenue as a percentage of overall MS revenue was primarily due to the decline in MS instrument revenue, which is attributed to the Applera litigation. TAI service revenue was approximately 9% of total TAI revenue. Compared to 2001, TAI service revenue grew by approximately 18% primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments. 19 Table of Contents Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2002 was $516.5 million compared to $497.3 million for 2001, an increase of $19.2 million or 4%. The majority of the increase in gross profit is due to a 4% increase in sales volume from 2001 to 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0% in 2002 from 57.9% in 2001. These gross profit amounts and gross profit percentages reflect a reclassification of certain labor and related costs associated with service revenues that were previously classified in operating expenses and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company experienced a higher mix of sales of more profitable consumables and services in 2002 as well as reductions in HPLC manufacturing costs due to lower material costs. The Company experienced growth in its HPLC chromatography column and sample preparation businesses, especially in the newly introduced X TerraTM, AtlantisTM columns as well as in OasisTM sample prep cartridges. Service revenue growth across all product groups was a result of higher demand for service plan contracts from major multi national pharmaceutical and chemical customers. In addition, the Company acquired the businesses of its Irish and Korean distributors in early 2002 and mid 2001, respectively. As such, the incremental profit from direct billings have increased gross profit and gross profit percentages in 2002, as well as operating expenses. The Company experienced an increase in service labor costs, offsetting some of the above mentioned increases in gross profit and gross profit percentage. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2002 and 2001 were $246.8 million and $219.0 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 27.7% for 2002 from 25.5% for 2001 after considering the reclassification of certain labor and related costs discussed above. The $27.8 million or 13% increase primarily resulted from increased headcount and related costs required to support anticipated increased current and future sales levels, including the acquisitions of Irish and Korean distributor businesses. Headcount rose from 2,133 at December 31, 2001 to 2,230 at December 31, 2002 or 5%. In addition, the Company recorded an increase of approximately $2.5 million in patent defense costs during 2002. The Company changed its method of accounting for legal costs associated with litigating patents effective January 1, 2002 and current year patent related expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company also recorded a provision of $1.5 million for estimated damages incurred with respect to ongoing patent infringement litigation during 2002. Expenses also slightly increased due to the effects of currency translation. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses were negligible in fiscal year 2002. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $51.9 million for 2002 and $46.6 million for 2001, an increase of $5.3 million or 11%. The Company continued to invest significantly in the development of new and improved HPLC, MS, thermal analysis and rheology products. Goodwill and Purchased Technology Amortization: Goodwill and purchased technology amortization for 2002 was $3.6 million compared to $7.1 million for 2001, a decrease of $3.5 million or 50%. The change was primarily related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002 in accordance with recently adopted accounting standards. Litigation Provisions: The Company recorded $2.8 million and $75.0 million for the Applera patent litigation in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2002 charge of $2.8 million was for additional liabilities associated with related product sales made in 2002 prior to the day of the jurys verdict in March 2002. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a litigation provision of $5.1 million relating to an estimated settlement of an outstanding case with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection regarding the Companys Taunton, Massachusetts facility. The provisions represent managements best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable loss related to this litigation. 20 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license asset with Variagenics, as the technology collaboration program was discontinued. There was no such charge in 2001. Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges: The Company recorded $7.4 million of charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 for restructuring and other directly related incremental costs relating to its integration of the worldwide sales, service and distribution groups of the Micromass division with the Waters HPLC division. The charges in 2002 include severance costs for 42 people, cancellation penalties for distributor contracts, facility closure costs and other specific incremental costs related to this integration. The objective of this strategy is to leverage the strengths of both divisions and align operating expenses to a more rational level as a percentage of sales. There was no such charge in 2001. The Company has included in the consolidated balance sheet in other long term liabilities approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2002, for non cancelable lease obligations with a portion to be paid out extending to 2012. The remaining $3.7 million of the liability is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2002. The following table provides additional information about the 2002 restructuring and other unusual charges (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, December 31, 2001 Charges Payments 2002 Severance $ $ 2,210 $ (555 ) $ 1,655 Facilities 2,400 (12 ) 2,388 Distributor terminations 1,350 1,350 Other 1,444 (1,366 ) 78 Total $ $ 7,404 $ (1,933 ) $ 5,471 The amount of expected annual cost savings was approximately $6.0 million. The Company believes that there were no material increases in other expenses or reductions in revenues as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost savings is comprised of head count reductions of approximately $4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility closures of approximately $0.2 million. Other Income (Expense), Net: In 2002, the Company recorded $13.7 million in pre tax charges for other than temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments, including investments in GeneProt and Variagenics. The impairment charges were offset by a $7.7 million termination fee received from GeneProt for cancellation of its $20.0 million order. To the Companys knowledge, this cancellation was due to changes in GeneProts ability to generate enough commercial interest to expand its business in the U.S. market. In 2001, the Company recorded a $7.1 million pre tax charge for an other than temporary impairment to the carrying amount of certain equity investments, primarily its investment in Variagenics. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $2.5 million and $1.3 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in interest expense due to accrued post judgment interest associated with the Applera patent litigation (Note 12). Interest Income: Interest income for 2002 and 2001 was $7.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million or 20% was due to higher cash balances in 2002. 21 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective income tax rate was 22.1% in 2002 and 22.3% in 2001. The 2002 tax rate decreased primarily due to the continued favorable shift in the mix of taxable income to lower tax rate jurisdictions. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle: In 2002, the method of accounting for patent related costs associated with patent litigation was changed effective January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated remaining economic life, to expensing the costs as incurred. The Company believes that this change is preferable because it will provide a better comparison with the Companys industry peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred. The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is included as a charge to net income for 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2003, net cash provided by the Companys operating activities was $152.8 million, primarily as a result of net income for 2003 and adding back depreciation of $22.0 million, amortization of intangible assets of $11.9 million, loss on sale of business of $5.0 million, tax benefits related to stock option exercises of $17.6 million, expensing of in process research and development of $6.0 million and changes in working capital needs primarily accounts payable and accrued expenses. During 2003, the Company paid approximately $59.6 million in connection with both the Applera patent litigation and the DEP settlement. Excluding the effects of currency translation and the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions, accounts receivable decreased approximately $7.2 million due to improved collection efforts at the end of 2003 compared to 2002. Days sales outstanding stood at 71 days at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Within liabilities, a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities used $31.0 million, primarily as income and other tax liabilities, and annual incentive payments were made. The Company completed its $200 million stock repurchase program during 2003 by purchasing $100.6 million of the Companys common stock. On May 6, 2003 the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $400 million in outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company believes that the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding number of shares through open market purchases. The Company believes it has the resources to fund this effort as well as to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. As of December 31, 2003, 7,540 shares had been purchased under the 2003 plan for $224.0 million. In the aggregate, the Company repurchased 11,939 shares of its common stock for $324.6 million during 2003. The Company had net borrowings at the end of 2003 of $246.3 million, primarily relating to borrowings in the U.S. under the Companys credit facility and term loan facility for the stock repurchases. In December 2003, the Company amended its existing $250.0 million Senior Revolving Credit Agreement dated February 2002 by closing on a $125.0 million Add On Term Loan Facility. The applicable interest to be charged changed from being based on the ratio of debt to total capitalization to debt to EBITDA. Loans under the amended Senior Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest for each quarter at a floating rate equal to, at the Companys option, 1) the applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 0.60% and 1.50% or 2) prime rate. Other uses of cash flow during the 2003 were $35.2 million for acquisitions (Note 5) and $34.6 million for property, plant and equipment and software capitalization investments. From financing activities, the Company received $27.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans. The Company believes that the existing cash and cash equivalent balance of $356.8 million and expected cash flow from operating activities together with borrowings available from its credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs beyond twelve months. The Company also held approximately $49.9 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2002 in connection with the standby letter of credit issued by the Company for the 22 Table of Contents unfavorable judgment in the Applera patent litigation (Note 12). As a result of the March 2003 affirmed judgment in the case, the Company paid approximately $53.7 million to Applera in April 2003, and the Company is no longer required to maintain a restricted cash balance. In March 2004, the Company made a one time payment to the Plaintiffs in the Applied BioSystems/MDS Sciex Instruments matter of $18.1 million, which is fully accrued at December 31, 2003. In July 2003, the Company paid $5.9 million in settlement of the environmental matter with the DEP in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts matter (Note 13). Commitments: The Company paid $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2004 for the acquisition of NuGenesis Technologies Corporation, (NuGenesis). The Company has various ongoing license and collaboration agreements in conjunction with its research and development efforts, totaling $1.2 million for the periods 2004 through 2008. Capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be modestly higher than 2003 levels, as the Company is evaluating its future facility needs. The Company has commitments for lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2019, covering certain buildings, office equipment and automobiles. The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid for licenses was approximately $2.9 million in 2003, $5.4 million in 2002, and $4.0 million in 2001. Future minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2003 are $0.8 million, $0.4 million, and immaterial for 2004, 2005 and 2008 and thereafter, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Long term debt $ 125,000 $ $ 20,000 $ 20,000 $ 85,000 $ Operating Leases 84,910 18,270 14,892 11,503 8,567 31,678 Other long term liabilities 350 350 Total $ 210,260 $ 18,270 $ 35,242 $ 31,503 $ 93,567 $ 31,678 Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 After 2007 Letters of Credit $ 2,284 $ 2,273 $ 11 $ $ $ From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation described in Note 12, Patent Litigation and Note 13, Environmental Contingency, will not be material to the financial position or results of operations. The Company paid $43.2 million in the first quarter of 2004 for the NuGenesis acquisition. This is described in more detail in Note 22, Subsequent Events. During fiscal year 2004, the Company expects to contribute $10.0 million to the Companys retirement plans. The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to product technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending, competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the Companys existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there are no provisions in the new credit facility, its real estate leases, and supplier and collaborative agreements that would accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical 23 Table of Contents transactions. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary: The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition: Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term, and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2003, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $55.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, installation hours and amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, independent credit reports, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003 was $214.3 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $5.6 million. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. 24 Table of Contents The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2003 was $128.8 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $15.1 million. Valuation of Equity Investments: The Company holds minority equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices. For investments where a company is not publicly traded, the Company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements and progress of technological expectations. The Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a $0.3 million charge to other expense, in the consolidated statements of operations, for the impairment of certain equity investments. At December 31, 2003, the Company had equity investments totaling $18.2 million included in other assets on the balance sheet. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Net intangible assets, long lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $376.9 million as of December 31, 2003. In 2002, SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, became effective and as a result, the Company ceased amortization of approximately $163.5 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2001. The Company had recorded approximately $4.0 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001. In lieu of amortization, the Company is required to perform annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2003 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty: Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2003, the Companys warranty liability was $11.1 million. 25 Table of Contents Income Taxes: As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. The Company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options. The corresponding credit was to additional paid in capital. Because of the outstanding stock options, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. income. Litigation: As described in Item 3 of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make both of these determinations, and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the headings Applera Corporation and Hewlett Packard Company. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. Recent Accounting Standards Changes In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued revised FASB Statement No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The revised standard provides additional required disclosures for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve disclosure transparency in financial statements. The revised standard replaces existing pension disclosure requirements. The revised SFAS 132 is effective, with some exceptions, for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, relating to consolidation of certain entities. FIN 46 requires identification of the Companys participation in variable interest entities (VIE), which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity 26 Table of Contents holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as a VIE, FIN 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the VIE, if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns. FIN 46 applies immediately to VIEs created or acquired after January 31, 2003. The Company has not invested in any variable interest in any VIEs subsequent to January 31, 2003. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in VIEs that are deemed significant, even if consolidation is not required. The application of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN 46R) to address various technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen since its issuance. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective for financial periods ending after March 15, 2004, thus the Company will implement the new provisions effective March 31, 2004. As FIN 46R was recently issued and contains provisions that the accounting profession continues to analyze, the Companys assessment of the impact of FIN 46R on all VIEs with which it is involved is ongoing. However, at this time and based on managements current interpretation, the Company does not believe that the implementation of FIN 46R will have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated financial statements, earnings or capital resources. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 established standards for how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS 150 were effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The application of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The changes in SFAS 149 improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for similarly. SFAS 149 is effective, with some exceptions, for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The application of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. The guidance in the consensus is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue 00 21 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial risk in several areas including changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. Further information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in Notes 2 and 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Foreign Exchange The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 29% of its sales denominated in Euros, 9% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign 27 Table of Contents currency exchange rates. The Company uses debt swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts to partially mitigate such effects, and these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. The debt swap agreements effectively swap higher U.S. dollar variable rate borrowings for lower variable rate borrowings denominated in the respective currencies. During 2003, the Company opened and subsequently closed debt swap agreements in Japanese yen. In December 2003, the Company entered into new debt swap agreements in Japanese yen, with notional amounts totaling $25.0 million, with terms of three months and an interest rate of 0.06%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $1.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which consisted of realized gains of $1.3 million relating to the closed debt swap agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million relating to the Japanese yen swap agreements, both of which partially offset hedged foreign exchange impacts. At December 31, 2002, the Company held debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional amounts totaling $25.0 million, with terms of three months and an interest rate of 0.07%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $1.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which consisted of realized losses of $1.4 million and unrealized gains of $0.4 million. During 2003, the Company also opened forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded realized losses of $3.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds that were entered in to and closed in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no open forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds. At December 31, 2002, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts in British pounds with notional amounts totaling $40.0 million and terms of forty five days. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $0.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the debt swap agreements as of December 31, 2003 would decrease by $2.5 million. The Company also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro and British pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. At December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $32.0 million and $69.0 million, respectively. Interest Rates The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations when borrowing in connection with its credit agreement. As a result, the Company may periodically attempt to minimize its interest rate exposures by using certain financial instruments such as interest swap agreements for purposes other than trading. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no outstanding interest swap agreements. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. 28 Table of Contents
