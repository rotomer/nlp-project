Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview: The Companys business in 2004 continued to benefit from stable pharmaceutical customer demand, improved industrial chemical customer demand and the impact of new product initiatives. Sales grew by 15% in 2004 and by 8% in 2003. Excluding currency effects, sales grew by 11% in 2004 and were flat in 2003. Geographically, business was strongest in the U.S., Japan, and Asia, particularly India and China, while trending positively in Europe during the second half of the year. Growth in these geographies was across all of the Companys product lines and in particular mass spectrometry (MS) products and ACQUITY UPLC systems, which accelerated sales in the second half of the year. From a product line perspective and excluding the impact of currency translation, the Waters Division liquid chromatography products (LC) including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) grew approximately 9% in 2004 and benefited from shipment of the ACQUITY systems, growth in LC service revenues of 13% and growth in LC chemical products of 10%. In mass spectrometry, sales grew approximately 6% in 2004, as initial shipments of the Q T of Premiertm augmented the full year performance of tandem quadrupole instrument sales. As a result of the acquisition of Creon Lab Control AG (Creon) in July 2003 and NuGenesis Technologies Corporation (NuGenesis) in February 2004, the Waters Division entered the laboratory informatics market (Laboratory Informatics). Laboratory Informatics products and service added approximately 2% to the Companys sales growth in 2004. The Thermal Analysis Division (TA) sales grew approximately 11% in 2004, benefiting from overall stronger industrial chemical customer demand, recent new product introductions and from the expansion of the business into overseas markets. Operating income was $284.9 million and $219.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, an increase of $65.7 million or 30% for the year. In 2004, operating income included the benefit of a litigation judgment in the amount of $17.1 million from Perkin Elmer Corporation offset by litigation provisions of $7.8 million and 15 Table of Contents a technology license asset impairment of $4.0 million. In 2003, operating income included expensed in process research and development of $6.0 million, a loss on sale of a business of $5.0 million, restructuring charges of $0.9 million and litigation provisions of $1.5 million. The remaining increase in operating income of $47.0 million is primarily a result of sales volume growth, reductions in manufacturing costs, operating expense leverage, and the effects of currency translations. Operating cash flow increased to $259.4 million in 2004 compared to $157.0 million in 2003. The increase of $102.4 million for the year is primarily attributable to the increase in net income and a decrease in the change of accrued litigation from $60.1 million in 2003 to $16.1 million in 2004 primarily related to the Applera patent litigation. In addition, the Company received $17.1 million in 2004 related to the Perkin Elmer Corporation patent litigation judgment. Capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment, software capitalization and other intangibles were $66.2 million in 2004 compared to $34.6 million in 2003. During 2004, the Company purchased a 250,000 square foot building adjacent to the Companys headquarters for $18.1 million. The Company intends to use this building to consolidate certain functions and facilities in Massachusetts in 2005 and spent an additional $3.2 million in 2004 to prepare the building for its intended use. In June 2004, the Company effectively concluded its $400.0 million stock buyback program previously announced in May 2003. The Company repurchased approximately 11.8 million shares under this program. In October 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company believes that the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the outstanding shares and has financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels. In 2004, the Company repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares of its common stock for $231.3 million, of which 1.2 million shares were purchased under the October 2004 program for $56.3 million. This follows a 2003 repurchase of a total 11.9 million shares of common stock for $324.6 million. In December 2004, the Company terminated its existing credit agreement early without penalty and entered into a new Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, many of which participated in the prior credit agreement. The new Credit Agreement increases the Companys borrowing capacity from $375.0 million to $700.0 million and provides for lower borrowing costs and less restrictive covenants. The Company believes that this additional borrowing capacity will provide the Company the flexibility to fund working capital needs, potential acquisitions and stock repurchases. The Company had outstanding borrowings at the end of 2004 of $456.7 million, primarily relating to borrowings in the U.S. under the Companys new Credit Agreement. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 (The Company has included references to the Notes of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.) Net Sales: Net sales for 2004 were $1,104.5 million, an increase of 15% compared to $958.2 million for 2003. Excluding currency effects, net sales grew 11% over 2003. Currency translation effect increased sales growth in 2004 by 4% primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In 2004, product sales increased $83.7 million or 12% and service sales increased $62.7 million or 27% over sales in 2003. The increase in product sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency translation, is primarily due to the continued strength of LC, MS and TA sales growth, the mid year launch of the ACQUITY UPLC system and the impact of acquired businesses. The increase in service sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency translation, is primarily due to growth in the Companys instrument installed base and sales of service contracts, including the effect of the Companys recent acquisitions. Waters Division Net Sales: With respect to the Waters Divisions performance by product line (excluding the effects of currency translation), LC sales (Liquid Chromatography including HPLC and UPLC product lines) grew approxi 16 Table of Contents mately 9%. The growth in LC instrument sales in 2004 was 7%. This growth was due principally to the introduction of new products, such as the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, and steady demand for existing instruments. In 2004, the sales of LC consumables (sample preparation devices) in the Companys chemistry operations grew 10% primarily as a result of continued strength in demand related to pharmaceutical production and the introduction of new chromatography columns, most notably the Sunfiretm product line. LC service sales grew 13% over 2003 due to increased sales of service plans to the Companys growing installed base of customers. For the LC business, service revenue was approximately 28% of total LC revenue in 2004. The growth of LC service revenue was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand primarily from large multi national customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters instruments. LC consumables account for approximately 19% of overall LC sales. MS sales grew approximately 6% in 2004 (excluding the effects of currency translation). The increase in sales over 2003 is primarily a result of strong growth of tandem quadrupole instruments throughout the year and the positive impact of new product shipments, especially the Q Tof Premier, late in the year. The growth in 2004 is also a result of weak 2003 MS performance, during which MS sales declined 18% over the prior year, due primarily to the effects of a patent litigation loss sustained in 2002. During 2004, the Company re entered all instrument categories impacted by the patent litigation loss. Service revenue for the MS product line accounted for approximately 19% of total MS revenue in 2004 and 2003, and grew approximately 12% in 2004 due to increased sales of service plans to the Companys growing installed base of customers. The Laboratory Informatics product line was expanded in 2004 with the acquisition of NuGenesis in the first quarter. In 2003, the Laboratory Informatics product and service offerings consisted of those from Creon, a company that Waters acquired in 2003. In 2004, Laboratory Informatics sales added approximately 2% to sales growth. Revenues consisted of new product sales as well as revenue associated with the servicing of the user base. Geographically, Waters LC and MS sales in Asia had the highest growth in 2004. Growth in Asia was highlighted by business associated with growth of the pharmaceutical industry in India and more broad based growth in China. More regulations for food and drinking water testing contributed to sales growth in Japan and in Southeast Asia. In Asia and in Japan, the Companys growth rates in sales (excluding the effects of currency translation) were 27% and 14%. respectively. Sales in the U.S. grew 12% while Europe experienced a modest 1% increase in sales due to slower sales volume in the first half of the year. TA Instruments Division Net Sales: Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments and related service revenues grew 11% in 2004 (excluding the effects of currency translation). The growth of this business was influenced by strong sales growth of 16% outside of the U.S., primarily from Europe and Asia, as a result of expanded sales and marketing efforts in the regions. Sales in the U.S. grew 5%. In 2004 and 2003, service revenue was approximately 26% of overall revenue and grew approximately 10% in 2004 primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2004 was $649.7 million compared to $560.4 million for 2003, an increase of $89.3 million or 16% and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.8% in 2004 from 58.5% in 2003. The increase in gross profit percentage is a net result of favorable foreign currency translation along with the continuing success of the Companys manufacturing cost reduction programs, offset by costs associated with additional service resources added to the Waters Division in support of the service product line growth. Within MS, there was a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales as a result of a product mix shift away from the higher margin Q Tof product line. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 and 2003 were $300.2 million and $264.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses declined slightly to 27.2% for 2004 compared 17 Table of Contents to 27.6% for 2003. The $35.9 million, or 14%, increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2004 included an increase of approximately $11.9 million as a result of currency translation; an incremental $10.4 million attributed to the Laboratory Informatics acquisition; an increase of $18.6 million in personnel costs attributed to higher headcount, selling related expenses related to the higher sales volume, annual merit increases and increased employee incentive plans costs as a result of the Companys 2004 performance. An increase in costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance of $3.2 million was offset by a decrease in litigation costs of $3.8 million. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was partially offset by $6.6 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains compared to the $2.2 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in 2003. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $65.2 million for 2004 and $59.2 million for 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 10%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to Laboratory Informatics acquisitions, the effects of foreign currency translation, and to the Companys continued commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. Purchased Intangibles Amortization: Purchased intangibles amortization for 2004 was $4.8 million compared to $4.2 million for 2003, an increase of $0.6 million or 14%. The increase primarily relates to the amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from the Laboratory Informatics acquisitions. Litigation Settlement and Provisions: Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2004 were a $9.3 million benefit compared to a litigation provision of $1.5 million for 2003. The Company recorded the benefit of a litigation judgment in the second quarter of 2004 in the amount of $17.1 million and a provision expense of $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. The benefit in 2004 is related to the conclusion of the Companys litigation with Perkin Elmer. The provision in 2004 is related to the on going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. In 2004, the Company made payments for legal fees and potential award deposits regarding the Hewlett Packard litigation in the amount of approximately $4.1 million. The Company recorded a $1.5 million expense in 2003 for an environmental matter concerning the Companys Taunton facility (Note 13). Loss on Sale of Business: The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the loss on the sale (Note 8) of the inorganic MS product line in 2003. There was no such charge in 2004. Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Sandia National Laboratories, as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. The remaining value of the license is approximately $1.0 million at December 31, 2004. There was no such charge in 2003. Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net: 2004 Restructuring: In January 2004, the Company initiated a restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various support functions and field sales and service organizations around the world. As a result, 70 employees were terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2004. The provision of $2.1 million represents costs incurred, including severance costs, for the 70 people and other directly related incremental costs of this realignment effort. 18 Table of Contents The following is a rollforward of the Companys 2004 restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2003 Charges Utilization Reversals 2004 Severance $ $ 1,968 $ (1,968 ) $ $ Other 115 (115 ) Total $ $ 2,083 $ (2,083 ) $ $ 2002 Restructuring: In July 2002, the Company took action to restructure and combine its field sales, service and distribution of its Micromass and LC operations. The objective of this integration was to leverage the strengths of both divisions and align and reduce operating expenses. The integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada, continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately 55 employees were terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company originally committed to closing four sales and distribution facilities, two of which were closed by December 31, 2004. The Company recorded $2.6 million of charges for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, for restructuring and other directly related incremental charges relating to its integration of the worldwide LC and MS sales, service and support organizations. The charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor termination costs and other directly related incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people, contract cancellation fees, non cancelable lease obligations and other directly related incremental costs. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reversed approximately $2.2 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to a change in plans with respect to two facilities previously selected for closure and distributor contract settlements being less than previously estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility closure and distributor termination costs being less than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees previously selected for termination. The following is a rollforward of the Companys LC and MS integration restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2003 Charges Utilization Reversals 2004 Severance $ 31 $ 23 $ (54 ) $ $ Facilities 1,937 (338 ) (1,599 ) Distributor terminations 475 (75 ) (400 ) Other 163 5 (10 ) (158 ) Total $ 2,606 $ 28 $ (477 ) $ (2,157 ) $ The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision of $0.1 million at its TA subsidiary for severance and other related costs in the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no such charges for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2002. Expensed In Process Research and Development: In 2003, in connection with the acquisition of Creon, the Company wrote off the fair value of purchased in process research and development (IPR&D) of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses. As of the Creon acquisition date (the Acquisition Date), there were four projects that met the above criteria. The 19 Table of Contents significant IPR&D projects identified consist of the eLab Notebook and the automatic LC MS dereplication system. The IPR&D charges associated with these projects were $4.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Management determined the valuation of the IPR&D using a number of factors, including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This valuation included consideration of (i) the stage of completion of each of the projects, (ii) the technological feasibility of each of the projects, (iii) whether the projects had an alternative future use, and (iv) the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. As of the Acquisition Date, none of the IPR&D projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. In assessing the technological feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from 55% to 60% per annum, depending on the projects stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased IPR&D resulted in a total valuation of $6.0 million. Although work on the projects related to the IPR&D continued after the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was written off because the projects underlying the IPR&D that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the Acquisition Date. As of December 31, 2004, the IPR&D automatic LC MS dereplication system project still had not reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining cost to complete this project is not considered material to the Company and there are currently no expected material variations between projected results from the projects versus those at the time of the acquisition. The Company expects the project to be completed within the next twelve months. Other Income (Expense), Net: In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of pre tax charges for other than temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments (Note 5). The 2004 pre tax charge of $1.0 million is for the Companys remaining investment carrying value of GeneProt. This charge was recorded based on the Companys current assessment of GeneProts financial condition. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $10.1 million and $2.4 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 interest expense is primarily attributed to the additional borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs (Note 10). Interest Income: Interest income for 2004 and 2003 was $11.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2004 and 23.6% in 2003. The change in effective tax rates for the period was impacted by the net tax effect of the Perkin Elmer litigation judgment received and litigation provisions and restructuring charges made during 2004, compared to the tax effect of certain litigation provisions, restructuring charges, expensed in process research and development and loss on sale of a business incurred during 2003. The effective tax rates, excluding these items and corresponding tax effects, were 21.0% 20 Table of Contents and 23.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 (The Company has included references to the Notes of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.) Net Sales: Net sales for 2003 were $958.2 million, an increase of 8% compared to $890.0 million for 2002. Excluding the favorable currency effects, net sales remained essentially flat over 2002. In 2003, product sales increased $25.9 million or 4% and service sales increased $42.4 million or 22% over sales in 2002. With respect to the Companys performance by product line (excluding the effects of currency translation), LC sales overall grew approximately 5%. In 2003, LC chemistry grew 11% primarily as a result of continued strength in sales related to pharmaceutical production. LC service sales grew 14% over 2002 due to increased sales of service plans to our growing installed base of customers. Growth in chemistry and service were offset by a decline of 1% in instrument sales during 2003. The decline in instrument sales is largely attributable to a combination of postponements and delays in purchase decisions for such instruments by the Companys customers for new and replacement products. For the LC business, service revenue was approximately 27% of total LC revenue in 2003 compared to 25% of revenue in 2002. The growth of service revenue was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand from large multi national customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters instruments. Chromatography consumables account for approximately 19% of overall LC sales and grew by approximately 11% in 2003. Chromatography consumable growth was driven by increased utilization of existing LC equipment and by the successful launch of a new line of chromatography columns and sample preparation devices. Geographically, the strongest growth areas of the world for LC in 2003 were Asia, Japan and Eastern Europe, achieving 16%, 10% and 40% growth, respectively. The U.S. grew modestly at 2%, while Europe experienced a decline of 4%. Sales growth in Asian and Eastern European geographies is related to economic modernization and development of basic infrastructure. Japan continues to be a robust market as Waters continues to offer Japanese language software products that meet local needs. Markets in the U.S. and Europe languished in 2003 as we saw a continuation of delays in instrument replacements early in the year at many of our pharmaceutical customers. MS sales declined approximately 18% in 2003, excluding the impact of the sale of the inorganic product line. The decline in sales over 2002 was across most geographic areas, primarily due to the impact of the Applera patent litigation, reduced MS instrument prices and a decline in pharmaceutical capital spending. Sales to customers working on proteomics applications in the pharmaceutical industry, government and academic sector and biotech all experienced declines in instrument purchases in 2003. The Company believes that its sales decline is a result of a temporary market decline in 2003 as well as a loss of market share to competing technologies that resulted in the overall 18% sales decline in MS. Service revenue for the MS product line accounted for approximately 19% of total MS revenue in 2003 compared to 12% in 2002, and grew approximately 27% during this period. The growth in MS service revenue as a percentage of overall MS revenue was primarily due to the decline in MS instrument revenue, which is attributed to reduced demand from proteomics customers. Sales for thermal analysis products grew 20% in 2003, excluding the impact of the acquired rheometry business. The growth of this business is geographically broad based with increased spending by core industrial chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The impact of sales in 2003 from the rheometry business acquisition added an additional 16% to the thermal analysis business growth. TA service revenue was approximately 26% of total TA revenue. Compared to 2002, TA service revenue grew by approximately 41% primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments and the Rheometrics acquisition. 21 Table of Contents Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2003 was $560.4 million compared to $516.5 million for 2002, an increase of $43.9 million or 8%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.5% in 2003 from 58.0% in 2002. The increase in gross profit of 8% is generally linear with the net sales increase of 8%, which is mostly attributed to favorable foreign exchange in 2003. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2003 and 2002 were $264.3 million and $246.8 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 27.6% for 2003 compared to 27.7% for 2002. The $17.4 million or 7% increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2003 included an increase of approximately $17.7 million as a result of currency translation, offset by a reduction in operating expenses of $0.3 million. The reduction in operating expenses includes cost savings of $4.5 million from the recently completed LC and MS field sales and service integration efforts, generating lower headcount and labor costs, associated fringe benefits and travel costs. These reductions were offset by annual merit increases across most divisions and other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs associated with the 2003 acquisitions totaling approximately $4.2 million. The Company experienced realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains of approximately $2.2 million in 2003 compared to losses of $0.8 million in 2002, an increase of $3.0 million. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $59.2 million for 2003 and $51.9 million for 2002, an increase of $7.3 million or 14%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to acquisitions, specifically Creon and Rheometrics, and to the Companys continued commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. In addition, the Company incurred contract research and development costs of $1.8 million related to new product development efforts for the Q Tof product line. Purchased Intangibles Amortization: Purchased intangibles amortization for 2003 was $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million for 2002, an increase of $0.6 million or 18%. The increase primarily relates to amortization associated with the intangible assets purchased as part of the Rheometrics and Creon acquisitions. Litigation Provisions: Litigation provision for 2003 was $1.5 million compared to $7.9 million for 2002. The Company recorded $1.5 million and $5.1 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to an environmental matter concerning the Companys Taunton facility (Note 13). In 2002, the Company recorded $2.8 million for the Applera patent litigation for liabilities associated with product sales made prior to the day of the unfavorable jurys verdict in March 2002 (Note 12). Loss on Sale of Business: The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the loss on the sale of the inorganic MS product line in 2003. There was no such charge in 2002 (Note 8). Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2002, the Company recorded a $2.4 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Variagenics, as the technology collaboration program was discontinued (Note 5). There was no such charge in 2003. Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net: The Company recorded $2.6 million in 2003 and $7.4 million in 2002 for restructuring and other directly related incremental costs relating to its integration of the worldwide LC and MS sales, service, manufacturing and support organizations. The charge in 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor terminations and other directly related incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge in 2002 includes severance 22 Table of Contents costs for 42 people, contract cancellation fees, non cancelable lease obligations and other directly related incremental costs. During 2003, the Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to distribution and facility settlements being less than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees previously selected for employment termination. There were no such reversals in 2002. The Company has included in the consolidated balance sheet in other long term liabilities approximately $1.5 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for non cancelable lease obligations with a portion to be paid out extending to 2012. The remaining $1.1 million and $3.7 million of the liability is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following is a rollforward of the Companys LC and MS integration restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2002 Charges Utilization Reversals 2003 Severance $ 1,655 $ 1,553 $ (2,672 ) $ (505 ) $ 31 Facilities 2,388 (60 ) (391 ) 1,937 Distributor terminations 1,350 400 (325 ) (950 ) 475 Other 78 661 (568 ) (8 ) 163 Total $ 5,471 $ 2,614 $ (3,625 ) $ (1,854 ) $ 2,606 The amount of expected annual cost savings is approximately $6.0 million. The Company began realizing savings of approximately $1.5 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter of 2003. The Company believes that there were no material increases in other expenses or reductions in revenues as a result of this restructuring. The annual cost savings is comprised of head count reductions of approximately $4.2 million, reductions in related travel, promotional and other expenses of approximately $1.6 million and facility closures of approximately $0.2 million. The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision of $0.1 million at its TA subsidiary for severance and other related costs in 2003. There were no such charges in 2002. Expensed In Process Research and Development: See Expensed In Process Research and Development herein under the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 discussion. Other Income (Expense), Net: In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $0.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in pre tax charges for other than temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments, including investments in GeneProt and Variagenics (Note 5). During 2002, the Company recorded a $1.0 million charge to other income (expense), in the consolidated statements of operations, for an other than temporary impairment of the equity investment and warrants resulting from Variagenics public stock price declines. In addition, in 2002, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $12.6 million to other income (expense) for an other than temporary impairment of its investment in GeneProt. This charge was recorded because to the Companys knowledge, GeneProt had been unable to generate enough commercial interest to expand its business in the U.S. market. Additionally, during 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a $0.3 million and $0.1 million charge, respectively, to other income (expense) for the impairment of certain other equity investments. The impairment charges in 2002 were offset by a $7.7 million termination fee received from GeneProt for cancellation of its $20.0 million order. There were no such off setting charges in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Interest Expense: Interest expense was $2.4 million and $2.5 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total interest expense in 2003 was offset by a $0.9 million reduction in an interest expense estimate relating to the calculation of interest expense for the Applera litigation paid in April 2003 (Note 12). Excluding this reduction, interest expense for 2003 would have been $3.3 million, or an increase of 32%. This increase primarily relates to interest expense on borrowings against the Companys credit facility to fund the stock repurchase program (Note 10). In 2002, the interest expense primarily related to accrued post judgment interest associated with the Applera litigation. Interest Income: Interest income for 2003 and 2002 was $7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The decline in interest income is primarily due to lower yields on cash investments. Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective income tax rate was 23.6% in 2003 and 22.1% in 2002. The 2003 effective tax rate increased primarily due to lower effective tax rates on special charges and the expensed in process research and development charge related to the Creon acquisition of $6.0 million not being tax deductible under German statutory law. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle: In 2002, the method of accounting for patent related costs associated with patent litigation was changed effective January 1, 2002 from a method of capitalizing the patent related costs and amortizing them over their estimated remaining economic life to expensing the costs as incurred. The Company believes that this change is preferable because it will provide a better comparison with the Companys industry peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred. The $4.5 million cumulative effect of the change on prior years (after reduction for income taxes of $1.3 million) is included as a charge to net income for 2002. There were no such charges for 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Net income $ 224,053 $ 170,891 Depreciation and amortization 41,926 33,848 Tax benefit related to stock option plans 32,012 17,582 Change in accounts receivable (36,453 ) 11,973 Change in inventories (11,575 ) (4,302 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 12,203 (30,005 ) Change in accrued litigation (16,095 ) (60,120 ) Other changes in operating activities 13,378 17,138 Net cash provided by operating activities 259,449 157,005 Net cash used in investing activities (108,605 ) (18,663 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 21,507 (63,640 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 9,945 18,767 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 182,296 $ 93,469 Net cash provided from operating activities was $259.4 million and $157.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The primary sources of net cash provided from operating activities were net income, the effect of depreciation and amortization, and the increase in the tax benefit related to stock option plans from stock 24 Table of Contents options exercised. Included in net income for 2004 was $17.1 million in proceeds for the Perkin Elmer litigation judgment. Depreciation and amortization increased in 2004 primarily from the increase in capital spending, higher software capitalization amortization and the effect of the Laboratory Informatics acquisitions. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased by 5 days to 76 days in 2004 from 71 days in 2003. The increase in accounts receivable and DSO are directly related to the timing of the Companys sales within the quarter, and foreign currency translation. The increase in inventory at December 31, 2004 is related to the development of new products, primarily the ACQUITY UPLC and the Q Tof Premier. The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities are primarily related to the timing of payments of income tax, compensation, and retirement accruals. Accrued litigation decreased by $16.1 million primarily due to the $18.1 million payment to Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments for the settlement of a patent litigation matter and approximately $4.1 million of payments in connection with the Hewlett Packard patent litigation matter, offset by a $7.8 million provision for the Hewlett Packard patent litigation in 2004. The remaining change in accrued litigation is attributed to payment of legal fees directly associated with existing litigation accruals. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $108.6 million in 2004 compared to $18.7 million in 2003. Additions to fixed assets and intangible assets were $66.2 million in 2004 and $34.6 million in 2003. Included in 2004 was a 250,000 square foot building purchase adjacent to the Companys headquarters for $18.1 million as well as approximately $3.2 million of costs in construction in progress related to improvements made to the building. The Company intends to use this building to consolidate certain functions and facilities in Massachusetts in 2005 and to accommodate growth over the next several years. Aside from the purchase of this building, fixed asset and intangible asset additions were consistent with capital spending trends and expectations throughout the respective years. Business acquisitions were $42.4 million and $35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as the Company continues to seek growth opportunities through acquisitions. Included in 2003 was approximately $49.9 million of cash provided by a decrease in restricted cash. The Company held approximately $49.9 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2002 in connection with the standby letter of credit issued by the Company in 2002 for the unfavorable judgment in the Applera patent litigation. Due to the March 2003 affirmed judgment in the case, the Company paid $53.7 million to Applera in April 2003. As a result of that payment, the Company will no longer be required to maintain a restricted cash balance. Regarding cash provided by (used in) financing activities, the Company repurchased 5.5 million and 11.9 million common stock shares at a cost of $231.3 million and $324.6 million, during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In October 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company believes that the share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding shares through open market purchases and that it has adequate financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels. During 2004, the Company purchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $56.3 million under the October 2004 Board of Directors authorized repurchase program and 4.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $175.0 million under a previously authorized program under which the Company has purchased the maximum amount of authorized shares. The Company believes it has the resources to fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue acquisition opportunities in the future. The Company received $45.0 million and $27.8 million of proceeds from other financing activities, including the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plans in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2004, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) to replace its existing credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million term loan facility, a $300.0 million revolving facility (US Tranche), and a $150.0 million revolving facility (European Tranche). The term loan facility and the revolving facilities both mature on December 15, 2009, and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $250.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility which is classified as long term debt and $190.0 million outstanding under the US Tranche revolving facility. The Company terminated its existing credit agreement early without penalty. The interest rates applicable to the term loan and revolving loans under the new credit agreement are 25 Table of Contents equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 29.5 basis points and 80.0 basis points. The Credit Agreement is unsecured in nature, and requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.5:1, and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3:1, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. The minimum interest coverage ratio on the terminated agreement was 5:1 and the maximum leverage ratio test was 2.5:1. In addition, the new credit agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The new credit agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. The new Credit Agreement increased the Companys committed syndicated borrowing capacity from $375.0 million to $700.0 million and provides for lower borrowing costs. The additional borrowing capacity will provide the Company the flexibility to fund working capital needs, potential acquisitions and stock repurchases. The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $539.1 million at the end of 2004 and expected cash flow from operating activities together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs beyond the next twelve months. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It has been the Companys practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company determine that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it will be required to establish an income tax expense and related tax liability on such earnings. If the Company elects this provision before it expires at the end of 2005, the Company could repatriate a maximum of $500.0 million in qualified foreign earnings. If the maximum was repatriated, the Company estimates an increase in the income tax provision of between $20.0 million and $45.0 million depending on the final technical clarifications. Commitments: The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid for licenses were approximately $1.1 million in 2004, $2.9 million in 2003 and $5.4 million in 2002. Future minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2004 are immaterial. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 Long term debt $ 250,000 $ $ $ $ $ 250,000 Operating leases 85,105 17,520 13,349 10,529 8,297 35,410 Other long term liabilities 527 527 Total $ 335,632 $ 18,047 $ 13,349 $ 10,529 $ 8,297 $ 285,410 26 Table of Contents Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 After 2008 Letters of credit $ 3,222 $ 3,222 $ $ $ $ From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation described in Note 12, Patent Litigation, will not be material to the financial position or results of operations. During fiscal year 2005, the Company expects to contribute approximately $7.5 million to the Companys retirement plans. Capital expenditures are expected to be modestly higher in 2005, excluding the recent building purchase, due to expected capital needs to support the growth in the business. The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to product technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending, competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the Companys existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there are no provisions in the new credit facility, its real estate leases, and supplier and collaborative agreements that would accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary: The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition: Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term, and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2004, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $66.8 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred 27 Table of Contents when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 was $271.7 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $7.1 million. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2004 was $139.9 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $14.1 million. Valuation of Equity Investments: The Company holds minority equity interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus, some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices. For investments where a company is not publicly traded, the Company obtains and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements and progress of technological expectations. The Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.3 million charges to other expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations, for the impairment of certain equity investments. At December 31, 2004, the Company had equity investments totaling $17.9 million included in other assets on the balance sheet. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures 28 Table of Contents any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology licenses with Sandia National Laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. Net intangible assets, long lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $85.2 million, $135.9 million, and $228.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2004 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty: Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2004, the Companys warranty liability was $10.6 million. Income Taxes: As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. The Company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options. The corresponding credit was to additional paid in capital. Because of the outstanding stock options, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. income. In the future event there is U.S. taxable income, the valuation allowance would be reversed and deferred tax assets recorded with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. Litigation: As described in Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination, and thus has recorded charges, with respect to the claims described under the heading Hewlett Packard Company. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. 29 Table of Contents Pension and Other Post retirement Benefits: Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other post retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00%. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, and changes as long term interest rates change. At year end 2004, the Company determined this rate to be 5.75%. Post retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the Companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits other than Pensions. Recent Accounting Standards Changes In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payments, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. The standard is effective for public companies for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The final standard allows alternative methods for determining fair value. At the present time, the Company has not determined which valuation method it will use; however, under the Black Scholes valuation model, it is estimated that the pre tax compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the second half of 2005 would be approximately $14.5 million. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29. This standard requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. This standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and should be applied prospectively. At the present time, the Company does not believe that adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. At the present time, the Company is evaluating SFAS 151 but does not believe that it will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA contains a series of provisions, several of which are pertinent to the Company. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It has been the Companys practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations and the Company currently still plans to continue to reinvest foreign earnings permanently into its foreign operations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the AJCA. As such, the Company is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Should the Company determine that it plans to repatriate any foreign earnings, it will be required to establish an income tax expense and related tax liability on such earnings. If the Company elects this provision before it expires at the end of 2005, the Company could repatriate a maximum of $500.0 million in qualified foreign earnings. If 30 Table of Contents the maximum was repatriated, the Company estimates an increase in the income tax provision of between $20.0 million and $45.0 million depending on the final technical clarifications. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. Further information regarding the Companys accounting policies for financial instruments and disclosures of financial instruments can be found in Notes 2 and 10 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of $1.6 million. The total pre tax amount of the gain that was re classified to earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The remaining $0.9 million will be re classified to earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding cash flow hedges. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 31% of its sales denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company. During 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in Yen foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately $25.0 million to approximately $37.0 million. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the notional amounts of outstanding contracts were approximately $37.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consisted of realized losses 31 Table of Contents of $1.6 million relating to closed cross currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of $0.8 million relating to the Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $1.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consisted of realized gains of $1.3 million and unrealized gains of $0.3 million.
