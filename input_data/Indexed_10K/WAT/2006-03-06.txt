Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Beginning in 2005, the Waters Division has included single quadrupole instruments within its reported mass spectrometry (MS) instrument system revenues. These had previously been categorized as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument systems. In addition, service sales for HPLC and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, LC) and MS have been consolidated into a single service sales classification. These changes were made to reflect current business reporting processes subsequent to the consolidation of the Waters Divisions LC and MS organizations. All product line and service sales, as well as sales growth percentages reported for the periods herein for Waters Division, reflect the new classifications as described above. Business and Financial Overview: The Companys sales grew 5% in 2005 over 2004 and 15% in 2004 over 2003. Sales, in constant currency, grew 5% in 2005 and 11% in 2004. In 2005, the Companys business was impacted by a weakness in demand from the Companys large pharmaceutical customers while sales to all other customers increased 7% in 2005 over 2004. This increase in sales was driven primarily by the Companys food and environmental testing, government and university and fine chemical customers. Demand for the Companys products from U.S. pharmaceutical customers was constrained due to new drug pipeline issues and the effects of merger and litigation issues affecting those customers in 2005 which led to a reduction in capital spending in comparison to the 2004 levels. Despite this weakness in the U.S., sales to non U.S. based pharmaceutical customers increased 8% in 2005. This sales growth was driven primarily by the Companys new products, the ACQUITY UPLCtm, the Q Tof Premiertm and Quattro Premiertm XE systems. Geographically, sales growth in 2005, before the effects of currency translation, was strongest in Japan (10%) and Asia (12%), particularly India and China, while sales in the U.S. (2%) and Europe (4%) grew more modestly. In order to capitalize on the strong sales growth anticipated in Asia and Japan in 2006, 16 Table of Contents the Company expects to accelerate its investment in these operations and fund this investment, in part, by managing expense growth in other geographies. These realignment efforts will result in one time expenses in 2006. From a product line perspective and excluding the impact of currency translation, Waters Division LC sales grew approximately 6% in 2005 and benefited from the shipment of ACQUITY UPLC systems, growth in service sales of 9% and growth in LC chemical product sales of 9%. In MS, sales grew approximately 2% in 2005, as full year growth in the shipments of the new Q Tof Premier and Quattro Premier systems was offset by softer sales of single quadrupole and magnetic sector devices. The Thermal Analysis Division (TA) sales grew approximately 9% in 2005, benefiting from overall stronger industrial chemical customer demand, recent new product introductions and from the expansion of its business into Asian markets. In February 2006, the Company began implementing a cost reduction plan, primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe that resulted in the employment of approximately 70 employees being terminated with effective dates through the third quarter of 2006. In addition, the Company plans to close a sales and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the third quarter of 2006. The Company expects to incur a one time estimated restructuring charge in 2006 in the range of $5.0 million to $7.0 million. The Company expects the entire restructuring plan to be completed by the third quarter of 2006. Cash expenditures associated with this restructuring are estimated to be similar to the timing of recording the expense. The Company is implementing this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world. Operating income was $283.2 million and $284.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, a decrease of $1.7 million. Operating income in 2005 was impacted by a litigation provision of $3.1 million related to a patent litigation settlement with Hewlett Packard Company in February 2006. In 2004, operating income included the benefit of a litigation judgment in the amount of $17.1 million from Perkin Elmer Corporation partially offset by the sum of litigation provisions of $7.8 million and a technology license asset impairment of $4.0 million. The remaining increase in operating income of $6.7 million was primarily a result of sales growth. Operating cash flow increased to $298.1 million in 2005 compared to $259.4 million in 2004. The increase of $38.7 million in 2005 is primarily attributable to improvements in days sales outstanding (DSO) and improving inventory turns. DSO improved to 70 days in 2005 from 76 days in 2004 while inventory turns improved to 3.6 turns in 2005 from 3.3 turns in 2004. Capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment, software capitalization and other intangibles were $51.0 million in 2005 compared to $66.2 million in 2004. In 2004, capital expenditures included the purchase of a building adjacent to the Companys headquarters, in Milford, Massachusetts, costing $18.1 million. In 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The Company will use the repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses and investments in the U.S. In connection with this distribution, all repatriated in the second half of 2005, the Company recorded $24.0 million of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Excluding the impact of this one time income tax expense, the Companys effective rate was 17.7% compared to 21.6% in 2004 as a result of the relative increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates, primarily Ireland. In October of 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company has repurchased 5.6 million shares at a cost of $216.1 million under this new program through December 31, 2005. During 2005, the Company repurchased a total of 15.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $659.3 million. This total includes share repurchases associated with the October 2005 program as well as previously authorized share repurchase programs. The Company believes that the share repurchase programs are beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the number of outstanding shares. The Company also believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given 17 Table of Contents current cash and debt levels, and invest in research, technology acquisitions and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. In October 2005, the Company fully exercised the $100.0 million expansion feature in the credit agreement dated December 2004, increasing the amount from $700.0 million to $800.0 million. In November 2005, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement that provides for a $250.0 million term loan facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $500.0 million of long term debt and $310.0 million of short term debt under these credit agreements for a total of $810.0 million outstanding as compared to $440.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2004, $250.0 million of which was classified as long term debt. The Company plans to use the proceeds of the term loan to finance the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase program previously approved by its Board of Directors and for general corporate purposes. The Company also believes that this additional borrowing capacity will provide the Company the flexibility to fund working capital needs and potential acquisitions. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales: Net sales in 2005 were $1,158.2 million, an increase of 5% compared to sales of $1,104.5 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation had no effect overall on sales growth in 2005. In 2005, product sales increased $27.9 million or 3% and service sales increased $25.8 million or 9% over sales in 2004. The increase in product sales is primarily due to the continued strength of LC, MS and TA instrument sales growth, increases in sales of chromatography columns and consumables and, particularly, the full year sales in 2005 of the ACQUITY UPLC system. The increase in service sales is primarily due to growth in the Companys instrument installed base and sales of service contracts. The Company expects sales to grow in 2006 from higher sales of new products and service sales growth in both of its operating divisions. The following commentary discusses the Companys sales performance by product line in constant currencies. Waters Division Net Sales: With respect to the Waters Divisions performance by product line, overall LC sales in 2005 grew approximately 6%. The growth in LC instrument sales in 2005 was 3%. This growth was due principally to the full year impact of products introduced in 2004, such as the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, in combination with demand for existing LC instruments. In 2005, the sales of LC consumables (sample preparation devices and chromatography columns) grew 9% primarily as a result of continued strength in demand from the introduction of the new XBridgetm, SunFiretm and ACQUITY UPLC chromatography columns and Oasis sample preparation cartridges. Service sales in 2005 grew 9% over 2004 due to increased sales of service plans to the Companys growing installed base of customers. For the LC business, service sales were approximately 33% of total LC revenue in 2005 as compared to 32% in 2004. Service sales growth was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand, primarily from large multi national customers, for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed Waters instruments and their newly purchased Waters instruments. LC consumables accounted for approximately 18% of overall LC sales in 2005 and 2004. MS sales grew approximately 2% in 2005. The increase in sales over 2004 is primarily the result of an increase in Q Tof Premier and Quattro Premier XE system sales substantially offset by weak single quadrupole and magnetic sector instrument sales. The Company plans to introduce new MS instruments in 2006 that it believes should refresh a substantial portion of its quadrupole based MS instrument sales. Geographically, Waters LC sales grew 11% in Asia and 9% in Japan while the U.S. and European sales grew 3% and 5%, respectively. MS sales were strongest in Japan growing at 8% while MS sales in the U.S. declined 6%. The Company believes that the MS sales in the U.S. were significantly and negatively impacted by the weak demand from the Companys large pharmaceutical customers. Sales growth rates in Asia and Japan were driven by business associated with pharmaceutical industry demand in India and more broad based growth in China. Increased regulations for food and drinking water testing also contributed to sales growth in Japan and in Asia. 18 Table of Contents TA Instruments Division Net Sales: Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments and related service sales grew 9% in 2005. Strong demand for TA products from customers outside of the U.S. contributed to the divisions overall sales growth. Sales growth for TA outside of the U.S. was 15% in 2005 compared to 2004. Strong demand for the divisions products in Japan and in Asia overall, associated with expanded sales and marketing efforts, were especially important factors in effecting the divisions positive sales growth performance. Sales in the U.S. grew 3%. In 2005 and 2004, service sales were approximately 27% and 26%, respectively, of overall revenue and grew approximately 16% in 2005, primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2005 was $679.9 million compared to $649.7 million for 2004, an increase of $30.2 million or 5% and generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.7% in 2005 from 58.8% in 2004. The slight decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to a higher mix of more costly new products, in particular the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, as well as lower sales of higher margin MS instruments. These factors negatively affecting gross profit percentage were partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin chromatography consumables and service sales. The Company expects that gross margin percent will decline slightly in 2006 as a result of the continued higher sales of new products with higher manufacturing costs, transitional expenses associated with the movement of Alliance instrument system production to Singapore as well as due to the expensing of stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 and 2004 were $321.7 million and $300.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 27.8% for 2005 compared to 27.2% for 2004. The $21.5 million or 7% increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2005 is primarily attributable to the following: an increase of approximately $4.1 million as a result of foreign currency effects that included a reduction of $2.2 million in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains; annual merit increases effective in April in both years and other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs of approximately $15.4 million; an increase in travel expenses of approximately $6.4 million; and an increase in expenses associated with a new building in Milford, Massachusetts acquired in 2004. The impact of these increases was primarily offset by lower management incentive compensation expense derived from 2005 financial results. The Company expects that selling and administrative expenses will grow in 2006 at a percentage rate that is slightly lower than the expected sales growth rate. This slower growth in expenses will be effected through cost reduction efforts that will result in a one time charge in 2006. This outlook does not include the effect of expensing of stock options under SFAS No. 123(R). Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $66.9 million for 2005 and $65.2 million for 2004, an increase of $1.7 million or 3%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount as the Company continues to invest in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. The Company expects research and development expenses to grow in 2006 at a similar rate to sales growth. This anticipated growth rate does not include the effect of expensing of stock options under SFAS No. 123(R). Litigation Settlement and Provisions: Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2005 were a $3.1 million charge compared to a $9.3 million net benefit for 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded a provision of $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Hewlett Packard Company (Hewlett Packard). This patent litigation was settled in February 2006. The Company recorded the benefit of a litigation judgment in the second quarter of 2004 in the amount of $17.1 million and a provision expense of $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. The benefit in 2004 is related to the conclusion of the Companys litigation with Perkin Elmer. The provision in 2004 was related to the on 19 Table of Contents going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. In 2005, the Company made payments for legal fees regarding the Hewlett Packard litigation in the amount of approximately $2.3 million. Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Sandia National Laboratories, as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. There was no such charge in 2005. The remaining value of the license was approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Income (Expense), Net: In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold all of its equity investment in Nuvello, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company also recorded a $4.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment for the full value of the Companys investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.s financial condition. In 2004, the Company recorded a $1.0 million pre tax charge for an other than temporary impairment to the Companys remaining investment carrying value of GeneProttm. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of GeneProts financial condition. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $24.7 million and $10.1 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 interest expense is primarily attributable to a combination of additional borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs and higher interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt. Interest Income: Interest income for 2005 and 2004 was $19.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes: In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the Companys practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations. On July 12, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the AJCA. The Company will use the repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Companys effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 26.4% and 21.6%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is the $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA. Excluding the income tax expense pertaining to the repatriation, the Companys effective tax rate was 17.7% for 2005. The effective tax rate of 21.6% in 2004 was impacted by the net tax effect of the Perkin Elmer litigation judgment received and the litigation provisions for the on going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. The effective tax rate excluding these items was 21.0% in 2004. The decrease in effective tax rates to 17.7% in 2005 from 21.0% in 2004, excluding the previously described items, is primarily attributable to the relative increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates, primarily Ireland. Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R) which amends SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of 20 Table of Contents operations based on their fair values. This charge will be allocated to line items within the consolidated statements of operations based on underlying employee service. The Company will begin recognizing these charges in the three months ending April 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method. The final standard allows alternative methods for determining fair value. The Company will use the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock based compensation awards. The Company has made changes to its equity compensation structure and will begin granting a combination of restricted stock units and non qualified stock options. The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in a negative impact to earnings per diluted share, net of tax, of approximately $0.21 to $0.24 in 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Sales: Net sales for 2004 were $1,104.5 million, an increase of 15% compared to $958.2 million for 2003. Excluding currency effects, net sales grew 11% over 2003. Currency translation effect increased sales growth in 2004 by 4% primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In 2004, product sales increased $83.7 million or 12% and service sales increased $62.7 million or 27% over sales in 2003. The increase in product sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency translation, is primarily due to the continued strength of LC, MS and TA sales growth, the mid year launch of the ACQUITY UPLC system and the impact of acquired businesses. The increase in service sales, aside from the effects of foreign currency translation, is primarily due to growth in the Companys instrument installed base and sales of service contracts, including the effect of the Companys recent acquisitions. Waters Division Net Sales: With respect to the Waters Divisions performance by product line (excluding the effects of currency translation), LC sales (Liquid Chromatography including HPLC and UPLC product lines) grew approximately 12%. The growth in LC instrument and data sales in 2004 was 13%. This growth was due principally to the introduction of new products, such as the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, the impact of businesses acquired and steady demand for existing instrument systems. In 2004, the sales of LC consumables (sample preparation devices) in the Companys chemistry operations grew 10% primarily as a result of continued strength in demand related to pharmaceutical production and the introduction of new chromatography columns, most notably the SunFiretm product line. Service sales grew 13% over 2003 due to increased sales of service plans to the Companys growing installed base of customers. Service sales were approximately 32% of total LC revenue in 2004. The growth of LC service sales was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand primarily from large multi national customers for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed base and newly purchased Waters instruments. LC consumables account for approximately 18% of overall LC sales. MS sales grew approximately 4% in 2004 (excluding the effects of currency translation). The increase in sales over 2003 is primarily a result of strong growth of tandem quadrupole instruments throughout the year and the positive impact of new product shipments, especially the Q Tof Premier, late in the year. The growth in 2004 is also a result of weak 2003 MS performance, during which MS sales declined over the prior year, due primarily to the effects of a patent litigation loss sustained in 2002. During 2004, the Company re entered all instrument categories impacted by the patent litigation loss. Geographically, Waters LC and MS sales in Asia had the highest growth in 2004. Growth in Asia was highlighted by business associated with growth of the pharmaceutical industry in India and more broad based growth in China. More regulations for food and drinking water testing contributed to sales growth in Japan and in Southeast Asia. In Asia and in Japan, the Companys growth rates in sales (excluding the effects of currency translation) were 16% and 12%, respectively. Sales in the U.S. grew 13% while Europe experienced an 8% increase in sales due to slower sales volume in the first half of the year. TA Instruments Division Net Sales: Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments and related service sales grew 11% in 2004 (excluding the effects of currency translation). The growth of this business was influenced by strong sales 21 Table of Contents growth of 16% outside of the U.S., primarily from Europe, Japan and Asia, as a result of expanded sales and marketing efforts in the regions. Sales in the U.S. grew 5%. In 2004 and 2003, service sales were approximately 26% of overall revenue and grew approximately 10% in 2004 primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2004 was $649.7 million compared to $560.4 million for 2003, an increase of $89.3 million or 16% and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.8% in 2004 from 58.5% in 2003. The increase in gross profit percentage is a net result of favorable foreign currency translation along with the continuing success of the Companys manufacturing cost reduction programs, offset by costs associated with additional service resources added to the Waters Division in support of the service product line growth. Within MS, there was a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales as a result of a product mix shift away from the higher margin Q Tof product line. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2004 and 2003 were $300.2 million and $264.3 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses declined slightly to 27.2% for 2004 compared to 27.6% for 2003. The $35.9 million, or 14%, increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2004 included an increase of approximately $11.9 million as a result of currency translation; an incremental $10.4 million attributed to acquisitions; an increase of $18.6 million in personnel costs attributed to higher headcount, selling related expenses related to the higher sales volume, annual merit increases and increased employee incentive plans costs as a result of the Companys 2004 performance. An increase in costs related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance of $3.2 million was offset by a decrease in litigation costs of $3.8 million. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was partially offset by $6.6 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains compared to the $2.2 million of realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains in 2003. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $65.2 million for 2004 and $59.2 million for 2003, an increase of $6.0 million or 10%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount due to acquisitions, the effects of foreign currency translation, and to the Companys continued commitment to invest significantly in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. Purchased Intangibles Amortization: Purchased intangibles amortization for 2004 was $4.8 million compared to $4.2 million for 2003, an increase of $0.6 million or 14%. The increase primarily relates to the amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from acquisitions. Litigation Settlement and Provisions: Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2004 were a $9.3 million net benefit compared to a litigation provision of $1.5 million for 2003. The Company recorded the benefit of a litigation judgment in the second quarter of 2004 in the amount of $17.1 million and a provision expense of $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. The benefit in 2004 is related to the conclusion of the Companys litigation with Perkin Elmer. The provision in 2004 is related to the on going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. In 2004, the Company made payments for legal fees and potential award deposits regarding the Hewlett Packard litigation in the amount of approximately $4.1 million. The Company recorded a $1.5 million expense in 2003 for an environmental matter concerning the Companys Taunton facility. Loss on Sale of Business: The Company recorded a $5.0 million charge relating to the loss on the sale of the inorganic MS product line in 2003. There was no such charge in 2004. 22 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Sandia National Laboratories, as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. The remaining value of the license is approximately $1.0 million at December 31, 2004. There was no such charge in 2003. Restructuring and Other Unusual Charges, net: 2004 Restructuring: In January 2004, the Company initiated a restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various support functions and field sales and service organizations around the world. As a result, 70 employees were terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2004. The provision of $2.1 million represents costs incurred, including severance costs, for the 70 people and other directly related incremental costs of this realignment effort. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys 2004 restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2003 Charges Utilization Reversals 2004 Severance $ $ 1,968 $ (1,968 ) $ $ Other 115 (115 ) Total $ $ 2,083 $ (2,083 ) $ $ 2002 Restructuring: In July 2002, the Company took action to restructure and combine its field sales, service and distribution of its Micromass and LC operations. The objective of this integration was to leverage the strengths of both divisions and align and reduce operating expenses. The integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada, continental Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately 55 employees were terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2003. In addition, the Company originally committed to closing four sales and distribution facilities, two of which were closed by December 31, 2004. The Company recorded $2.6 million of charges for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, for restructuring and other directly related incremental charges relating to its integration of the worldwide LC and MS sales, service and support organizations. The charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people, distributor termination costs and other directly related incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes severance costs for 42 people, contract cancellation fees, non cancelable lease obligations and other directly related incremental costs. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reversed approximately $2.2 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to a change in plans with respect to two facilities previously selected for closure and distributor contract settlements being less than previously estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reversed approximately $1.9 million in restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility closure and distributor termination costs being less than previously estimated and the retention of certain employees previously selected for termination. 23 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys LC and MS integration restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, Reserve December 31, 2003 Charges Utilization Reversals 2004 Severance $ 31 $ 23 $ (54 ) $ $ Facilities 1,937 (338 ) (1,599 ) Distributor terminations 475 (75 ) (400 ) Other 163 5 (10 ) (158 ) Total $ 2,606 $ 28 $ (477 ) $ (2,157 ) $ The Company also recorded an unrelated restructuring provision of $0.1 million at its TA subsidiary for severance and other related costs in the year ended December 31, 2003. There were no such charges for the year ended December 31, 2004. Expensed In Process Research and Development: In 2003, in connection with the acquisition of Creon, the Company wrote off the fair value of purchased in process research and development (IPR&D) of various projects for the development of new products and technologies in the amount of $6.0 million. The amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses. As of the Creon acquisition date (the Acquisition Date), there were four projects that met the above criteria. The significant IPR&D projects identified consist of the eLab Notebook and the automatic LC MS dereplication system. The IPR&D charges associated with these projects were $4.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Management determined the valuation of the IPR&D using a number of factors, including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This valuation included consideration of (i) the stage of completion of each of the projects, (ii) the technological feasibility of each of the projects, (iii) whether the projects had an alternative future use, and (iv) the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. As of the Acquisition Date, none of the IPR&D projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality. In assessing the technological feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from 55% to 60% per annum, depending on the projects stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased IPR&D resulted in a total valuation of $6.0 million. Although work on the projects related to the IPR&D continued after the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D was written off because the projects underlying the IPR&D that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the Acquisition Date. Other Income (Expense), Net: In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of pre tax charges for other than temporary impairments to the carrying amounts of certain equity investments. The 2004 pre tax 24 Table of Contents charge of $1.0 million is for the Companys remaining investment carrying value of GeneProt. This charge was recorded based on the Companys current assessment of GeneProts financial condition. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $10.1 million and $2.4 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2004 interest expense is primarily attributed to the additional borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs. Interest Income: Interest income for 2004 and 2003 was $11.9 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2004 and 23.6% in 2003. The change in effective tax rates for the period was impacted by the net tax effect of the Perkin Elmer litigation judgment received and litigation provisions and restructuring charges made during 2004, compared to the tax effect of certain litigation provisions, restructuring charges, expensed in process research and development and loss on sale of a business incurred during 2003. The effective tax rates, excluding these items and corresponding tax effects, were 21.0% and 23.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates, primarily Ireland. Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 201,975 $ 224,053 $ 170,891 Depreciation and amortization 43,685 41,926 33,848 Tax benefit related to stock option plans 4,872 32,012 17,582 Deferred Taxes 10,235 1,468 (5,926 ) Change in accounts receivable (6,515 ) (36,453 ) 10,938 Change in inventories (6,973 ) (11,575 ) (4,302 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 26,802 12,203 (30,005 ) Change in accrued litigation 688 (16,095 ) (60,120 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 7,551 1,526 3,277 Other changes 15,747 10,384 20,822 Net cash provided by operating activities 298,067 259,449 157,005 Net cash used in investing activities (51,045 ) (108,605 ) (18,663 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (272,015 ) 21,507 (63,640 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (20,496 ) 9,945 18,767 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (45,489 ) $ 182,296 $ 93,469 Net cash provided by operating activities was $298.1 million, $259.4 million, and $157.0 in 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively. The primary sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities aside from net income, and reasons for their change, are as follows. Depreciation and amortization have increased over the three years presented as a result of higher capital spending on equipment and facilities, and the full year impact of acquisitions, particularly in 2005 and 2004. Deferred income taxes decreased in 2005 primarily as a result of the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards. The change in the tax benefit related to stock option plans is primarily attributable to the significant exercises of stock options in 2003 and 25 Table of Contents 2004 related to previously granted options about to expire which had low exercise prices. The change in accounts receivable is primarily related to the timing of the Companys sales within the quarter, the timing of cash receipts from customers and foreign currency translation. DSO at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 70 days, 76 days and 71 days, respectively. The growth in inventory over the three years is primarily related to the Companys sales growth and the introduction of new products, most recently the ACQUITY UPLC system. Although inventory levels have grown they have not increased at the same rate of sales growth thus resulting in improved inventory turns of 3.6, 3.3 and 3.1 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities are primarily related to the increase in income tax accruals resulting from the repatriation of funds in 2005 and timing of payments of income tax, compensation, and retirement accruals during the three years presented. The 2005 change in accrued litigation is attributed to payment of legal fees directly associated with existing litigation accruals and a provision of $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Hewlett Packard Company, which was settled in February 2006. The 2004 change in accrued litigation of $16.1 million is primarily due to the $18.1 million payment to Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex Instruments for the settlement of a patent litigation matter and a $7.8 million provision offset by approximately $4.1 million of payments in connection with the Hewlett Packard patent litigation matter. The 2003 change in accrued litigation of $60.1 million is primarily attributed to the Company paying $59.6 million in connection with both the Applera patent litigation and the DEP settlement. Changes in deferred revenue and customer advances are primarily attributable to the Companys growth in service sales contracts and the timing of contract billings. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $51.0 million in 2005 compared to $108.6 million in 2004 and $18.7 million in 2003. Additions to fixed assets and intangible assets were $51.0 million in 2005, $66.2 million in 2004 and $34.6 million in 2003. Included in 2004 was a 250,000 square foot building purchase adjacent to the Companys headquarters in Milford, Massachusetts for $18.1 million as well as approximately $3.2 million of costs in construction in progress related to improvements made to the building. Aside from the purchase of this building, fixed asset and intangible asset additions were consistent with capital spending trends and expectations throughout the respective years to accommodate the Companys growth. Business acquisitions were $42.4 million and $35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2005. In addition, net cash used by investing activities in 2003 benefited from the release of the restricted cash related to a payment made to Applera for an unfavorable judgment in patent litigation. Regarding cash provided by (used in) financing activities, the Company repurchased 15.4 million, 5.5 million and 11.9 million common stock shares at a cost of $659.3 million, $231.3 million and $324.6 million, respectively, during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, under previously announced programs. On October 24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company repurchased 5.6 million shares at a cost of $216.1 million under this new program through December 31, 2005 leaving $283.9 million authorized for repurchases in the future. The Company believes that these share repurchase programs benefit shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the outstanding shares while maintaining adequate financial flexibility given current cash and debt levels to fund future share repurchases and pursue acquisition opportunities. The Company received $16.8 million, $45.0 million and $27.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plans in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004 and 2003 were unusually high due to significant exercises of stock options related to previously granted options about to expire. In November 2005, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the November 2005 Credit Agreement) that provides for a $250.0 million term loan facility due in November 2010. The Company may, on a single occasion, request of the lender group that the facility be increased up to an additional $100.0 million. The Company plans to use the proceeds of the term loan to finance the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase program previously approved by its Board of Directors and for general corporate purposes. The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under the November 2005 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR 26 Table of Contents rate, in each case plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 37.5 basis points and 112.5 basis points. The November 2005 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1, and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the November 2005 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in the Companys existing credit facility. The November 2005 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, similar in nature to those in the Companys existing credit facility. In December 2004, the Company had entered into a syndicated committed Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) that provides for a $250.0 million term loan facility due in December 2009 and, subsequent to the amendment discussed below, a $450.0 million revolving facility, which includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. In October 2005, the Company fully exercised the $100.0 million expansion feature in the credit agreement dated December 2004, increasing the amount from $700.0 million to $800.0 million. The Company used the proceeds of the additional borrowings to finance the repurchase of common stock and for general corporate purposes as provided for under the Credit Agreement. In October 2005, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement) to increase the leverage ratio test from not more than 3.0:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, to 3.25:1 and to amend the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to exclude stock based compensation to the extent deducted from consolidated net income pursuant to Statement SFAS No. 123(R). All other terms and conditions under the original Credit Agreement with respect to interest rates, interest coverage ratio test, maturity dates and affirmative and negative covenants remained substantially the same in the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $250.0 million borrowed under the November 2005 Credit Agreement and $560.0 million under the Amended Credit Agreement for a total of $810.0 million borrowed under the two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of $238.4 million after outstanding letters of credit. In total, $500.0 million of the total debt was classified as long term debt and $310.0 million classified as short term debt at December 31, 2005 in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2004, the Company had aggregate borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement of $440.0 million of which $250.0 million was classified as long term debt. The remaining amounts of short term debt of $16.3 million and $16.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, represent various local lines of credit throughout the Companys worldwide subsidiaries. The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $493.6 million at the end of 2005 and expected cash flow from operating activities together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. In July 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the AJCA all of which was repatriated as a cash dividend by December 31, 2005 in accordance with the Board approved plan. The Company will use the repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The Company made $10.0 million in tax payments during 2005 and the Company expects to make tax payments of approximately $9.0 million during the first quarter of 2006. The remaining $5.0 million of this tax liability was offset by the tax benefit of a net operating loss carryforward (NOL), which was credited to additional paid in capital in the third quarter of 2005. The tax benefit of the NOL was previously reserved for as a valuation allowance in additional paid in capital since the NOL was originally associated with non qualified stock option compensation expense recognized for tax purposes. The tax benefit became realizable as a result of the 27 Table of Contents repatriation in the third quarter of 2005, and accordingly, income taxes payable was reduced and additional paid in capital was credited for $5.0 million. Commitments: The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid for licenses were approximately $0.8 million in 2005, $1.1 million in 2004 and $2.9 million in 2003. Future minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2005 are immaterial. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Long term debt(1) $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ $ Operating leases 92,897 19,497 15,859 13,349 10,275 9,135 7,534 17,248 Other long term liabilities(2) Total $ 592,897 $ 19,497 $ 15,859 $ 13,349 $ 260,275 $ 259,135 $ 7,534 $ 17,248 Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Letters of credit $ 1,633 $ 1,633 $ $ $ $ $ $ (1) The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and term loan and revolving loans under the existing credit agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 37.5 basis points and 112.5 basis points. At current and long term debt and interest rate levels consistent with those at December 31, 2005, the Companys interest expense would be approximately $44.0 million, annually. (2) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, will not be material to the financial position or results of operations. The Company paid approximately $13.5 million in the first quarter of 2006 for the net assets of the food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership. This is described in more detail in Note 6, Acquisitions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company, and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2006, the Company expects to contribute approximately $10.0 million to $12.0 million to the Companys pension plans. Capital expenditures in 2006 are expected to be at similar levels expended in 2005 to support the growth in the business. The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to product technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending, competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the Companys existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there are no provisions in its credit facilities, its real estate leases, or supplier and collaborative agreements that would 28 Table of Contents accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary: The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term, and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2005, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $71.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the vendors fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period. With respect to installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash 29 Table of Contents holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition as amended by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Nearly all of the Companys instruments contain embedded operating system and data management software, which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant post delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005 was $256.8 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $6.6 million. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2005 was $131.6 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $13.4 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology licenses with Sandia National Laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. Net intangible assets, long lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $84.4 million, $141.0 million, and $210.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The Company performs annual impairment 30 Table of Contents reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2005 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty: Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2005, the Companys warranty liability was $11.7 million. Income Taxes: As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. The Company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. The Company has a significant income tax benefit associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options recorded to additional paid in capital. Historically, the Company believed that it was more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets associated with this tax benefit would not be realized and as a result, a valuation allowance was established for all the deferred tax assets relating to U.S. income. This valuation allowance against U.S. assets was maintained until an appropriate level of taxable income in the U.S. could be sustained. In 2005, the Company believed it had reached an appropriate sustainable level of profitability in the U.S.; therefore, $92.5 million of the valuation allowance was reversed, of which $78.8 million was credited to additional paid in capital and the balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the Company made in 2004. The Company made this determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time. Litigation: As described in Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination, and thus has recorded charges, with respect to the claims described under the heading Hewlett Packard Company. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. 31 Table of Contents Pension and Other Post retirement Benefits: Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other post retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the Companys benefit obligation and expense. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2005 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At year end 2005, the Company determined this rate to be 5.50% for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the Companys benefit obligation and expense. Post retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the Companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits other than Pensions. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.4 million. A one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.1 million. Recent Accounting Standards Changes In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles. This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. This Statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. At the present time, the Company does not believe that adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The interpretation requires a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The interpretation is effective for years ending after December 15, 2005. The interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment which amends SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. The standard is effective for public companies for the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The final standard allows alternative methods for determining fair value. The Company will use the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock based compensation awards. The Company has made changes to its equity compensation structure and will begin granting a combination of restricted stock units and non qualified stock options. The Company estimates that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), under the modified prospective method, will result in a negative impact to earnings per diluted share, net of tax, of approximately $0.21 to $0.24 in 2006. 32 Table of Contents In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107 Share Based Payments which expresses the SEC Staffs views regarding the application of SFAS No. 123(R). As noted above, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), as applied using standards set forth in SAB 107, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29. This standard requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. This standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. At the present time, the Company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date of June 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax unrealized losses of $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of $1.6 million. The total pre tax amount of the gain that was recognized in earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The remaining $0.9 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap. 33 Table of Contents Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in interest rates, the fair market value of the floating to fixed rate interest rate swap would decrease by approximately $2.7 million and increase interest expense by approximately $2.0 million. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 30% of its sales denominated in Euros, 12% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2005. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company. During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately $30.0 million to approximately $50.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately $50.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross currency interest rate swap agreements. During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately $26.0 million to approximately $37.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional amounts of the outstanding contracts were zero and $37.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax realized losses of $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the closed Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded cumulative pre tax losses of $2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of $1.6 million related to closed Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of $0.8 million relating to the open Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $1.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $1.3 million relating to the closed Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million relating to the open Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in British Pounds ranging from approximately 25.0 million to 75.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements the Company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell British Pounds, and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy British Pounds, with option premiums that offset. At December 31, 2005, the Company had range forward agreements in British Pounds with a notional amount of 30.0 million outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open British Pound range forward agreements. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no range forward agreements in British Pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre tax loss of $8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income, related to the closed range forward agreements. During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its net investment position. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company 34 Table of Contents recorded a cumulative net pre tax gain of $0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $0.5 million related to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of $0.2 million related to the British Pound forward agreements. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts in British Pounds with a notional amount of approximately 45.0 million outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded realized losses of $3.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to forward foreign exchange contracts in British Pounds that were entered into and closed in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no open forward foreign exchange contracts in British Pounds. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the cross currency interest rate swap, range forwards and foreign exchange contracts agreements, designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operations, as of December 31, 2005, would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately $10.4 million. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $72.9 million and $62.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $0.5 million, which consists of realized gains of $1.5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $4.6 million, which consists of realized gains of $4.5 million on closed forward contracts and a $0.1 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded cumulative pre tax gains of $5.4 million, which consists of realized gains of $4.6 million on closed forward contracts and $0.8 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts, as of December 31, 2005, would decrease earnings by approximately $7.3 million. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. 35 Table of Contents
