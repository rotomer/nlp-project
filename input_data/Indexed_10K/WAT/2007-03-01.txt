Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview: The Companys sales were $1,280.2 million, $1,158.2 million and $1,104.5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sales grew 11% in 2006 over 2005 and 5% in 2005 over 2004. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these years can be primarily attributed to the Companys introduction of new products and sustained growth in Asia. The 2006 and 2005 sales growth benefited from the introduction of the ACQUITY UPLC and the Quattro Premiertm XE based systems and an increase in chemistry consumable sales. In addition, the 2006 sales growth also benefited from the introduction of the new SQD, TQD and Synapttm HDMS mass spectrometry systems which were introduced in the second half of 2006. The effect of currency translation benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by less than 1%, principally in Europe, and was neutral to the 2005 sales growth rates. U.S. sales increased 4% and 2%; European sales grew 12% and 3%; and Asian sales (including Japan) grew 19% and 10% during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Asian sales growth was strongest in India and China. In 2006, global sales to pharmaceutical customers rebounded from 2005 levels and industry wide sales grew 8%, as these customers increased their capital spending on the Companys new products. Global sales to pharmaceutical customers were weak in 2005 as the Companys large pharmaceutical customers decreased capital spending as these customers dealt with various new drug pipeline, merger and acquisition and litigation issues. Global sales to industrial and food safety customers continued its positive trend as sales grew 13% in 2006 over 2005. The TA Division (TA) sales, a business with a heavy industrial focus, grew 9% and 8% for 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the sales growth can be attributed to new product introductions and expansion of its Asian businesses. The Waters Division sales grew by 11% in 2006 and 4% in 2005. The Waters Divisions products and services consist of LC & MS instrument systems which include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, herein referred to as LC), mass 16 Table of Contents spectrometry (MS) products, chemistry consumable products, and LC and MS services. The sales growth is strongly influenced by ACQUITY UPLC sales and sales growth in the chemistry consumables business. In 2006, the Company continued to enhance its operations in Asia by expanding an existing partnership to manufacture instrumentation in Singapore. The Company transitioned the manufacturing of the Alliance instrument system and, while the Company expects to achieve cost savings efficiencies in the future, the overall impact during the ramp up in 2006 was slightly negative on gross profit margin percentages in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating income was $295.2 million, $283.2 million and $284.9 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating income was primarily impacted by the following: The $12.0 million net increase in 2006 operating income from 2005 is primarily a result of the increased sales volume being partially offset by the $28.0 million of the additional stock based compensation costs incurred as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R) Share Based Payment and $8.5 million of restructuring costs incurred relating to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. The Company does not expect to incur any significant additional restructuring costs for this initiative in the future. The $1.7 million net decrease in operating income in 2005 from 2004 is primarily attributable to a litigation provision of $3.1 million related to a patent litigation settlement with Hewlett Packard Company in February 2006 that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining increase in 2005 operating income was primarily a result of sales growth. The 2004 operating income included the benefit of a litigation judgment in the amount of $17.1 million from Perkin Elmer Corporation partially offset by litigation provisions of $7.8 million and a technology license asset impairment of $4.0 million. The Company continuously evaluates its equity investments for impairment and, as a result, the Company recorded, in net other expense, a net write down of certain equity investments in the amount of $5.8 million, $3.1 million and $1.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2005 net write down is a gain on the sale of an equity investment of $1.7 million. Operating cash flow was $263.6 million, $298.1 million and $259.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2006 operating cash flow was a $9.0 million tax payment associated with the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), a $3.5 million litigation payment and $7.0 million of severance and other facility related payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative. The 2005 operating cash flow included an AJCA payment of approximately $10.0 million. The decline in the 2006 operating cash flow can also be attributed to an increase in inventories of $29.9 million over 2005. The inventory increase is attributable to the ramp up of new product introductions and an increase in the safety stock levels resulting from the outsourcing of the Alliance instrument system manufacturing. Operating cash flows continue to benefit from the improvement in accounts receivable collection measured in days sales outstanding (DSO). DSOs were 64 days, 70 days and 76 days at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment, software capitalization and other intangibles were $51.4 million, $51.0 million and $66.2 million, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures have remained substantially unchanged over the last three years. Capital expenditures in 2004 included $18.1 million for the purchase of a building adjacent to the Companys headquarters. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. On December 15, 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Environmental Resources Associates, Inc., (ERA), a provider of environmental testing products for quality control, proficiency testing and specialty calibration chemicals used by environmental laboratories, for approximately $62.5 million in cash and the assumption of $3.8 million of debt. The Company expects that ERA will add approximately $17.0 million of product sales and be about neutral to earnings in 2007 after debt service costs. In February 2006, the Company acquired the net assets of the food safety business of VICAM Limited Partnership (VICAM) for approximately $13.8 million. VICAM products added approximately $8.0 million to sales and were about neutral to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 after debt service costs. VICAM product sales in 2007 are expected to be approximately $10.0 million. In August 2006, the Company acquired all of 17 Table of Contents the outstanding capital stock of Thermometric AB (Thermometrics), a manufacturer of high performance microcalorimeters, for a total of $2.5 million in cash and the assumption of $1.2 million of debt. Thermometrics products added approximately $1.5 million to sales and were neutral to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006. Thermometrics sales are expected to be approximately $4.0 million in 2007. During 2006, management continued to apply the Companys net cash flow to repurchase shares of Company stock through the $500.0 million program authorized by the Companys Board of Directors in October 2005. During 2006, the Company purchased 5.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $249.2 million. The Company has repurchased an aggregate of 11.3 million shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of $465.3 million, leaving $34.7 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company believes that the share repurchase programs are beneficial to shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the number of outstanding shares. The Company also believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, and invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. In January 2007, the Company terminated multiple term loan and revolving credit agreements entered into 2005 and 2004. The Company refinanced the credit agreement facilities to expand its debt capacity to $1.1 billion, reduce its borrowing rates and extend the maturity by two years. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales: Net sales for 2006 and 2005 were $1,280.2 million and $1,158.2 million, respectively, an increase of 11%. Foreign currency translation benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by less than 1%. Product sales were $922.5 million and $834.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 11% over 2005. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in LC, MS and TA instrument systems sales, an increase in chemistry consumables sales and the effect of acquisitions. Service sales were $357.7 million and $323.6 million in the 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the Companys installed base of instruments and higher sales of service contracts. The following commentary discusses the Companys sales performance by product line. Waters Division Net Sales: The Waters Division sales grew approximately 11% in 2006. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the 2006 Waters Division sales growth by less than 1%. Chemistry consumables sales grew approximately 18% in 2006. This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology, new XBridgetm columns, Oasis sample preparation products and the sales associated with the acquired VICAM product line. LC and MS service sales grew 9% in 2006 due to increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. LC and MS instrument systems sales grew 9% in 2006. The increase in LC and MS instrument sales during 2006 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC systems and higher MS triple quadrupole system sales, offset by a decline in lower end MS systems sales. Waters Division sales by product mix was substantially unchanged in 2006 and 2005 with instruments, chemistry and service representing approximately 57%, 16% and 27% respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia (including Japan) strengthened approximately 4%, 12% and 19%, respectively, in 2006. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 2% in Europe and decreased sales growth in Asia by 3% in 2006. The growth in Europe was broad based across most major countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, while Asias growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China. U.S. sales growth in 2006 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical and industrial customers. TA Division Net Sales: TA Divisions sales grew 9% in 2006 as a result of TAs new product introductions and expansion of its Asian businesses. Foreign currency translation had no impact to this overall sales growth rate. Instrument sales grew 4% as TA introduced four new differential scanning calorimeters during 2006 and, in late August 2006, the Company entered the field of microcalorimetry through the acquisition of Thermometrics. Instrument system sales represented approximately 70% and 73% of sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. TA service sales grew 22% in 2006 and 18 Table of Contents can be attributed to the increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales growth for 2006 was predominantly in Europe and Asia. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2006 was $744.0 million compared to $679.9 million for 2005, an increase of $64.1 million or 9% and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.1% in 2006 from 58.7% in 2005. The 2006 gross profit was negatively impacted by $4.3 million of stock based compensation costs relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The remaining slight decrease in gross profit percentage in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to product transition costs to Singapore and product introduction costs on new MS instruments. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2006 and 2005 were $357.7 million and $321.7 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.9% for 2006 compared to 27.8% for 2005. The $36.0 million or 11% increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2006 is primarily due to additional stock based compensation costs of $18.6 million, annual merit increases across most divisions, other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs of $11.6 million. Other increases in selling and administration expenses were offset by decreases related to the February 2006 cost saving initiative. The Company has made investments in Asia, largely in the second half of 2006, in support of growing business opportunities and management expects expenses to continue to grow at a modest rate in the future as compared to 2006. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $77.3 million for 2006 and $66.9 million for 2005, an increase of $10.4 million or 16% primarily due to stock based compensation costs of $5.1 million relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)and the merit increases across most divisions, other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs. The remaining increases in research and development expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects the costs of introducing multiple new MS instruments in the second half of 2006. 2006 Restructuring: In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe that resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world. The following is a summary of activity of the Companys 2006 restructuring liability (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, December 31, 2005 Charges Utilization 2006 Severance $ $ 6,443 $ (5,010 ) $ 1,433 Other 2,041 (1,993 ) 48 Total $ $ 8,484 $ (7,003 ) $ 1,481 The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges connection with the February 2006 restructuring initiative. The Company achieved approximately $4.4 million of cost savings in 2006 from this initiative, mostly in the second half of 2006, and expects to achieve approximately $7.4 million in cost savings annually as a result of this restructuring. Other charges include approximately $0.7 million of leasehold improvement assets, net of accumulated amortization, written off as a result of the closure of the facility in the Netherlands. Litigation Provisions: Litigation provisions in 2005 were $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Agilent Corporation and Hewlett Packard Company (Hewlett Packard). This patent litigation was settled in February 2006 and recorded in the 2005 statement of operations. No additional provisions were made in 2006. 19 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net: In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $5.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Caprion). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the Company learned that Caprions financial condition had deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the Companys assessment, would result in the Companys investment being substantially diminished. The remaining value of the Caprion investment was approximately $1.7 million as of December 31, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold all of its equity investment in Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company also recorded a $4.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment for the full value of the Companys investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.s financial condition. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $51.7 million and $24.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in 2006 interest expense is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt and an increase in average borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs. Interest Income: Interest income for 2006 and 2005 was $25.3 million and $19.3 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes: The Companys effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 15.5% and 26.4%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign subsidiaries under the ACJA. The remaining decrease in the effective tax rates for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the proportionate increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates, primarily Ireland and Singapore. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit at a higher effective tax rate in 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales: Net sales in 2005 were $1,158.2 million, an increase of 5% compared to sales of $1,104.5 million in 2004. Foreign currency translation had no significant effect overall on sales growth in 2005. In 2005, product sales increased $27.9 million or 3% and service sales increased $25.8 million or 9% over sales in 2004. The increase in product sales is primarily due to the continued strength of LC, MS and TA instrument sales growth, increases in sales of chemistry consumables and, particularly, the full year sales in 2005 of the ACQUITY UPLC system. The increase in service sales is primarily due to growth in the Companys instrument installed base and sales of service contracts. Waters Division Net Sales: Waters Divisions sales in 2005 grew approximately 4%. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased overall sales by 1%. The growth in LC and MS instrument system sales in 2005 was 2%. This growth was due principally to the full year impact of products introduced in 2004, such as the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, in combination with demand for existing LC instruments, and an increase in Q Tof Premier and Quattro Premier XE system sales substantially offset by weak single quadrupole and magnetic sector instrument sales. In 2005, the sales of chemistry consumables (sample preparation devices and chromatography columns) grew 8% primarily as a result of continued strength in demand from the introduction of the new XBridge, SunFiretm and ACQUITY UPLC chromatography columns and Oasis sample preparation cartridges. Service sales in 2005 grew 8% over 2004 due to increased sales of service plans to the Companys growing installed base of customers. Service sales growth was geographically broad based and was driven by increased demand, primarily from large multi national customers, for service plans to maintain a higher percentage of their installed Waters instruments and their newly purchased Waters instruments. The 2005 Waters Division sales product mix for instruments, chemistry and service was approximately 57%, 16% and 27%, respectively. The 2004 Waters Division sales product mix for instruments, chemistry and service was approximately 59%, 14% and 27%, respectively. 20 Table of Contents Geographically, Waters Division sales grew 10% in Asia and 7% in Japan while the U.S. and European sales grew 1% and 3%, respectively. Foreign currency translation had no significant impact on sales growth in 2005; except in Japan where sales were negatively impacted by 3%. Sales growth rates in Asia and Japan were driven by business associated with pharmaceutical industry demand in India and more broad based growth in China. Increased regulations for food and drinking water testing also contributed to sales growth in Japan and in Asia. TA Division Net Sales: Sales for thermal analysis instruments, rheometry instruments and related service sales grew 8% in 2005. Instrument system sales grew 6% as strong demand for TA products from customers outside of the U.S. contributed to the divisions overall sales growth. Instrument system sales represented approximately 73% of sales in 2005 and 2004. Sales growth for TA outside of the U.S. was 13% in 2005 compared to 2004. TAs positive sales growth performance can be attributed to the strong demand for TAs products in Japan and Asia and TAs worldwide expanded sales and marketing efforts. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew 3% while sales in Japan and Asia grew 20% and 39% in 2005, respectively. In 2005, service sales grew approximately 15% primarily as a result of providing service to a larger installed base of instruments. Gross Profit: Gross profit for 2005 was $679.9 million compared to $649.7 million for 2004, an increase of $30.2 million or 5% and generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.7% in 2005 from 58.8% in 2004. The slight decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to a higher mix of more costly new products, in particular the ACQUITY UPLC instrument, as well as lower sales of higher margin MS instruments. These factors negatively affecting gross profit percentage were partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin chemistry consumables and service sales. Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling and administrative expenses for 2005 and 2004 were $321.7 million and $300.2 million, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased to 27.8% for 2005 from 27.2% for 2004. The $21.5 million or 7% increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2005 is primarily attributable to the following: an increase of approximately $4.1 million as a result of foreign currency effects; annual merit increases and other headcount additions and related fringe benefits and indirect costs of approximately $15.4 million; an increase in travel expenses of approximately $6.4 million; and an increase in expenses associated with a new building in Milford, Massachusetts acquired in 2004. The impact of these increases was primarily offset by lower sales commissions and management incentive compensation expense derived from 2005 financial results. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were $66.9 million for 2005 and $65.2 million for 2004, an increase of $1.7 million or 3%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount as the Company continues to invest in the development of new and improved LC, MS, thermal analysis and rheometry products. Litigation Provisions and Settlement: Net litigation settlements and provisions for 2005 were a $3.1 million charge compared to a $9.3 million net benefit for 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded a provision of $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Hewlett Packard. This patent litigation was settled in February 2006. In 2004, the Company recorded the benefit of a litigation judgment in the amount of $17.1 million and a provision expense of $7.8 million. The benefit in 2004 is related to the conclusion of the Companys litigation with Perkin Elmer. The provision in 2004 was related to the on going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. In 2005, the Company made payments for legal fees regarding the Hewlett Packard litigation in the amount of approximately $2.3 million. Impairment of Long Lived Asset: In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology license with Sandia National Laboratories, as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. There was no such charge in 2005. The remaining value of the license was approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 21 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net: In 2005, the Company sold all of its equity investment in Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1.7 million. In 2005, the Company also recorded a $4.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment for the full value of the Companys investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.s financial condition. In 2004, the Company recorded a $1.0 million pre tax charge for an other than temporary impairment to the Companys remaining investment carrying value of GeneProttm. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of GeneProts financial condition. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $24.7 million and $10.1 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 interest expense is primarily attributable to a combination of additional borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs and higher interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt. Interest Income: Interest income for 2005 and 2004 was $19.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher cash balances and higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes: In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multi national corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the Companys practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into foreign operations. On July 12, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of $500.0 million as a qualified distribution in accordance with the AJCA. The Company has used and will continue to use the repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax liability of $24.0 million for the federal, state and foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period distribution in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The Companys effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 26.4% and 21.6%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA. The 2004 effective tax rate was impacted by the net tax effect of the Perkin Elmer litigation judgment received and the litigation provisions for the on going patent infringement suit with Hewlett Packard. The remaining change in effective tax rates is primarily attributable to the relative increase in income in international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates, primarily Ireland. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 222,200 $ 201,975 $ 224,053 Depreciation and amortization 46,159 43,685 41,926 Stock based compensation 28,813 765 75 Deferred income taxes 506 10,235 1,468 Tax benefit related to stock option plans 4,872 32,012 Change in accounts receivable (9,803 ) (6,515 ) (36,453 ) Change in inventories (29,853 ) (6,973 ) (11,575 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 1,670 26,802 12,203 Change in accrued litigation (4,420 ) 688 (16,095 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 1,230 7,551 1,526 Other changes 7,092 14,982 10,309 Net cash provided by operating activities 263,594 298,067 259,449 Net cash used in investing activities (130,374 ) (51,045 ) (108,605 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (125,906 ) (272,015 ) 21,507 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 13,264 (20,496 ) 9,945 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 20,578 $ (45,489 ) $ 182,296 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities was $263.6 million and $298.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $34.5 million decline in net cash provided from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income and the impact of stock compensation under SFAS 123(R): The change in accounts receivable in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2006 as compared to 2005. The days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 64 days at December 31, 2006 from 70 days at December 31, 2005. The change in inventory in 2006 compared to 2005 results from the increase in inventory due to the ramp up of new MS products, an increase in LC instrument inventory associated with the transition to higher production levels of ACQUITY systems from Alliance systems and a planned increase in the Alliance inventory levels during the outsourcing transition. The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by cash payments made on increased inventory levels, severance and other facility related payments of $7.0 million in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a litigation payment of $3.5 million to settle the Hewlett Packard litigation. Also included in the change in accounts payable and other current liabilities in 2006 was a tax payment in the amount of $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation of cash under the AJCA. During 2005, the income tax accrual was increased by $24.0 million resulting from the repatriation of funds under the AJCA. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2006 and 2005 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. 2006 net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2005 was impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Under SFAS No. 123(R), $16.5 million of benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as cash from financing activities in 2006; prior to the adoption 23 Table of Contents of SFAS No. 123(R), this benefit of $4.9 million in 2005 was reported as part of cash from operating activities. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities was $298.1 million and $259.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $38.7 million increase in the net cash provided from operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 can be attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of the net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: Depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of higher capital spending on equipment and facilities, and the full year impact of acquisitions, particularly in 2004. Deferred income taxes decreased in 2005 primarily as a result of the utilization of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards. The change in accounts receivable is primarily related to the timing of the Companys sales within the quarter, the timing of cash receipts from customers and foreign currency translation. DSO at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were 70 days and 76 days, respectively. The growth in inventory over the two years is primarily related to the Companys sales growth and the introduction of new products. Although inventory levels have grown, they have not increased at the same rate as sales growth, thus resulting in improved inventory turns of 3.6 and 3.3 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities are primarily related to the increase in income tax accruals resulting from the repatriation of funds in 2005 and timing of payments of income tax, compensation, and retirement accruals. The 2005 change in accrued litigation is attributed to payment of legal fees directly associated with existing litigation accruals and a provision of $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Hewlett Packard, which was settled in February 2006. The 2004 change in accrued litigation of $16.1 million is primarily due to the $18.1 million payment to Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments for the settlement of a patent litigation matter and a $7.8 million provision offset by approximately $4.1 million of payments in connection with the Hewlett Packard patent litigation matter. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2005 and 2004 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $130.4 million in 2006 compared to $51.0 million in 2005 and $108.6 million in 2004. Additions to fixed assets and intangible assets were $51.4 million in 2006, $51.0 million in 2005 and $66.2 million in 2004. Included in 2004 was a building purchase adjacent to the Companys headquarters in Milford, Massachusetts for $18.1 million, as well as approximately $3.2 million of costs in construction in progress related to improvements made to the building. Aside from the purchase of this building, fixed asset and intangible asset additions were consistent with capital spending trends and expectations throughout the respective years to accommodate the Companys growth. Business acquisitions were $79.0 million and $42.4 million in 2006 and 2004, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2005. Cash Used in Financing Activities During 2006, the Companys net change in debt borrowings was a $72.2 million increase compared to a $369.6 million increase in 2005 and a $210.4 million increase in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had $885.0 million borrowed under two existing credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of $163.4 million after outstanding letters of credit. In total, $500.0 million of the total debt was classified as long term debt and $385.0 million classified as short term debt at December 31, 2006 in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining amount of short term debt of $18.5 million at December 31, 2006 consists of various local lines of credit throughout the Companys worldwide subsidiaries. 24 Table of Contents The Company repurchased 5.8 million, 15.4 million and 5.5 million common stock shares at a cost of $249.2 million, $659.3 million and $231.3 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, under previously announced stock repurchase programs. On October 24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares over a two year period. The Company has repurchased 11.3 million shares at a cost of $465.3 million under this new program through December 31, 2006, leaving $34.7 million authorized for repurchases in the future. The Company believes that these share repurchase programs benefit shareholders by increasing earnings per share through reducing the outstanding shares while maintaining adequate financial flexibility given current cash and debt levels. The Company received $39.9 million, $16.8 million and $45.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plans in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Proceeds from stock options exercised in 2004 were unusually high due to significant exercises of stock options related to previously granted options about to expire. The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $514.2 million at the end of 2006 and expected cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from a number of financing alternatives and external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. On January 11, 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement (the 2007 Credit Agreement). The 2007 Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million term loan facility, a $350 million revolving facility (U.S. Tranche), which includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility, and a $250 million revolving facility (European Tranche) that is available to Waters Corporation in U.S. dollars and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either U.S. dollars or Euro. Waters Corporation may on one or more occasions request of the lender group that commitments for the U.S. Tranche or European Tranche be increased by an amount of not less than $25 million, up to an aggregate additional amount of $250 million. Existing lenders are not obligated to increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. On January 11, 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million under the new term loan facility, $115 million under the new European Tranche, and $270 million under the new U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay the outstanding amounts under the Companys existing multi borrower credit agreement dated as of December 15, 2004 and amended as of October 12, 2005 and the Companys existing term loan agreement dated as of November 28, 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such agreements early without penalty. The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. The facility fee on the 2007 Credit Agreement ranges between 7 basis points and 15 basis points. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively, the same as the terminated credit agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in nature to those in the terminated credit agreements. Commitments: The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid for licenses were approximately $0.6 million in 2006, $0.8 million in 2005 and $1.1 million in 2004. Future minimum licenses fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2006 are immaterial. 25 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Long term debt(1) $ 500,000 $ $ $ 250,000 $ 250,000 $ $ $ Operating leases 84,228 18,894 15,679 12,260 9,404 8,195 7,605 12,191 Other long term liabilities(2) Total $ 584,228 $ 18,894 $ 15,679 $ 262,260 $ 259,404 $ 8,195 $ 7,605 $ 12,191 Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Letters of credit $ 1,608 $ 1,608 $ $ $ $ $ $ (1) The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under the existing credit agreement and term loan and revolving loans under the existing credit agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 37.5 basis points and 112.5 basis points. At current and long term debt and interest rate levels consistent with those at December 31, 2006, the Companys interest expense would be approximately $52.0 million annually. This amount considers the credit margins under the 2007 Credit Agreement mentioned above. (2) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, will not be material to the financial position or results of operations. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2007, the Company expects to contribute approximately $4.0 million to $8.0 million to the Companys pension plans. Capital expenditures in 2007 are expected to be at similar levels expended in 2006 to support the growth in the business. The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, product technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending, competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and changes in foreign exchanges rates, that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the Companys existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there are no provisions in its credit facilities, its real estate leases, or supplier and collaborative agreements that would accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary: The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term, and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2006, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $76.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the vendors fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Nearly all of the Companys instruments contain embedded operating system and data management software, which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant post delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. 27 Table of Contents Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006 was $272.2 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $8.4 million. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2006 was $168.4 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $14.3 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. In 2004, the Company recorded a $4.0 million charge for an other than temporary impairment of its technology licenses with Sandia National Laboratories as a significant portion of the technology collaboration program was suspended. Net intangible assets, long lived assets, and goodwill amounted to $131.7 million, $149.3 million, and $265.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2006 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty: Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2006, the Companys warranty liability was $12.6 million. 28 Table of Contents Income Taxes: As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization, and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a Company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had determined that it was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of $167.5 million of its deferred tax assets would not be realized. The Company had therefore recorded a cumulative $167.5 million valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting purposes as of December 31, 2004. The valuation allowance was determined based on the Companys review of its future estimated U.S. taxable income levels and the estimated future stock option exercises. Included in this $167.5 million valuation allowance was $154.9 million related to the future tax benefit of U.S. net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options. As required by SFAS No. 109 and APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the Company had originally recorded all $154.9 million of these future tax benefits as increased additional paid in capital. Accordingly, when the Company recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax benefits, the Company also reduced additional paid in capital by $154.9 million. As required by SFAS No. 109, the Company maintained this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined, during 2005, that it was more likely than not that it would realize the actual tax benefit of $92.5 million of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been previously provided. The Company made this determination based on the level of the Companys actual 2005 U.S. taxable income, the Companys projected future U.S. taxable income levels, the Companys actual 2005 tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options and the fact that the Companys future tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options would most likely be less than in the past as those options, which were significantly in the money, were expiring and exercised by December 31, 2005. The Company therefore recorded, in 2005, a $92.5 million reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Because this reduction in the valuation allowance included $78.8 million related to the future tax benefit of U.S. net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options, the Company also restored $78.8 million to the Companys additional paid in capital in 2005, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 and APB No. 25. The remaining balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the Company made in 2004. The Company made the determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time. Litigation: As described in Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination, and thus has recorded charges, with respect to the claims described under the heading Hewlett Packard Company. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges, which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. 29 Table of Contents Pension and Other Retirement Benefits: Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is the majority of the Companys benefit obligation and expense. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2006 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2006, the Company determined this rate to be 5.82% for the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is the majority of the Companys 2006 benefit obligation and 2007 expense. Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the Companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.4 million. A one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. pension plan by approximately $0.2 million. Stock based Compensation: The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, on January 1, 2006. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs associated with awards for 2006 now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. The after tax stock based compensation and the impact to diluted earnings per share of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $20.6 million with a $0.20 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has capitalized stock based compensation costs of $0.6 million and $1.0 million to inventory and capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25 and related interpretations, including Financial Interpretation (FIN) 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, for its plans. Under this accounting method, stock option compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at the current fair 30 Table of Contents value of the Companys common stock as of the date of the award generally did not require compensation expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock based compensation expense recognized for the Companys fixed employee stock option plans, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan was $0.8 million in 2005. The 2005 stock based compensation expense amounts were all recorded in selling and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): Unrecognized Compensation Weighted Average Costs Life in Years Stock options $ 61.1 3.1 Restricted stock units $ 11.8 2.8 Restricted stock $ 0.3 1.1 Total $ 73.2 3.0 Recent Accounting Standards Changes In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, and SAB 107, Share Based Payment. These standards require that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. The adoption of these standards did have a material effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. See Note 13, Stock Based Compensation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles. This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 Chapter 4. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140. This standard permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133; requires evaluation of interests in securitized financial assets; clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. This standard is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company does not believe that adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes new methodology by which a company must measure, report, present, and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take. The interpretation requires financial 31 Table of Contents statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of the tax reporting positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of these effects for the time value of money. In addition, the interpretation also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax reporting positions. The interpretation will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This standard addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which amends SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and SFAS No. 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This standard requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans, previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. This standard also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. In addition, this statement will require disclosure of the effects of the unrecognized gains or losses, prior service costs and transition asset or obligation on the next fiscal years net periodic benefit cost. This standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 and retrospective application of this standard is not permitted. The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Companys financial position. See Note 16, Retirement Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as to the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. This standard addresses quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7a: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified 32 Table of Contents intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date of June 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax realized gain of $0.5 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out the swap, resulting in a pre tax gain of $0.4 million. The gain was deferred and will be recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate swap. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of $125.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date of 21 months. The Company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of $1.6 million. The total pre tax amount of the gain that was recognized in earnings in 2004 was $0.7 million. The remaining $0.9 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 over the original term of the interest rate swap. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 34% of its sales denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2006. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company. During 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately $30.0 million to approximately $100.0 million. At December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately $100.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $11.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of $9.7 million and unrealized losses of $1.3 million. At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding contracts was approximately $50.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $0.7 million relating to closed Euro cross currency interest rate swap agreements. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements, designated as hedges of net investment in foreign operation, as of December 31, 2006, would decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately $10.0 million. During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately $26.0 million to approximately $37.0 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional amounts of the outstanding contracts were zero and $37.0 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax realized losses of $0.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the closed Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded cumulative pre tax losses of $2.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of 33 Table of Contents $1.6 million related to closed Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized losses of $0.8 million relating to the open Japanese Yen cross currency interest rate swap agreements. During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in British Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements in British Pounds ranging from approximately 25.0 million to 75.0 million. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company purchases an option below the current spot rate to sell British Pounds and sells an option to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy British Pounds, with option premiums that offset. At December 31, 2005, the Company had range forward agreements in British Pounds with a notional amount of 30.0 million outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open British Pound range forward agreements. At December 31, 2004, the Company had no range forward agreements in British Pounds outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre tax loss of $8.6 million to accumulated other comprehensive income, related to the closed range forward agreements. During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts in British Pounds. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its net investment position. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $1.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax gain of $0.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $0.5 million related to closed forward agreements and unrealized gains of $0.2 million related to the British Pound forward agreements. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $70.9 million and $72.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $3.9 million, which consists of realized gains of $2.5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1.4 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $0.5 million, which consists of realized gains of $1.5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1.0 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $4.6 million, which consists of realized gains of $4.5 million on closed forward contracts and a $0.1 million of unrealized gains on the open forward contracts. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts, as of December 31, 2006, would decrease earnings by approximately $7.1 million. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with weighted average original maturities of 90 days or less, in commercial paper, bank deposits, repurchase agreements and money market funds. Cash equivalents are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company periodically maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits. 34 Table of Contents
