Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Restatement of Fiscal 2007 Quarterly Financial Data As further described in Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has restated its unaudited consolidated balance sheets and unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the first three quarters in fiscal 2007, to change the classification of certain marketable securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments. Business and Financial Overview The Companys sales were $1,473.0 million, $1,280.2 million and $1,158.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales grew 15% in 2007 over 2006 and 11% in 2006 over 2005. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these years can be primarily attributed to the Companys introduction of new products; an increase in spending by 17 Table of Contents the Companys pharmaceutical, industrial, governmental and academic customers; the benefits from acquisitions and the effects of foreign currency translation. Net income per diluted share was $2.62, $2.13 and $1.74 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew at a rate of 23% in 2007 over 2006 and 22% in 2006 over 2005. The effect of currency translation benefited the 2007 sales growth rate by 3% and benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by less than 1%, both increases principally resulting from European sales. U.S. sales increased 17% and 4%; European sales increased 17% and 12%; and Asian sales (including Japan) increased 12% and 19% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, global sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 13% and 8%, respectively, as these customers increased their capital spending on the Companys new products. Global sales to government and academic customers were 24% higher in 2007 and 16% higher in 2006 and can be primarily attributed to strong demand of the Companys new products in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Global sales to industrial and food safety customers grew 16% in 2007 and 13% in 2006 primarily as a result of the benefit from acquisitions and strong demand for the Companys new products. The Waters Division sales grew by 14% in 2007 and 11% in 2006. The Waters Divisions products and services consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, herein referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and chemistry consumable products and related services. The Waters Division sales growth was strongly influenced by ACQUITY UPLC sales; the new high resolution Q Tof Premiertm and new Synapttm HDMStm systems; organic sales growth from the chemistry consumables business and the 2006 acquisitions. These acquisitions added 1% to the 2007 sales growth. Sales growth for the TA Division (TA), a business with a heavy industrial focus, grew 27% and 9% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. TAs sales growth can be primarily attributed to new product introductions and the impact of the August 2007 acquisition of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation (CSC), a privately held company that designs, develops and manufactures highly sensitive calorimeters and the August 2006 Thermometric AB (Thermometric) acquisition. The CSC and Thermometric sales benefited TAs sales growth rate by 4% in 2007. CSCs earnings after debt service were about neutral for the year ended December 31, 2007. CSC product sales in 2008 are expected to be approximately $5.0 million. TA sales growth for 2007 also benefited from a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007. In September 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved various amendments to freeze the pay credit accrual under the Waters Retirement Plan and the Waters Retirement Restoration Plan (the U.S. Pension Plans) effective December 31, 2007 and, effective January 1, 2008, the employer matching contribution in the Waters Employee Investment Plan (a 401(k) defined contribution plan) was increased by 3%. The Companys Board of Directors also approved a transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan to assist employees in transitioning to the new pension benefit design. The Company recorded a $12.6 million charge in 2007 relating to this transition benefit that will be contributed to the Waters Employee Investment Plan in the first quarter of 2008. Operating income was $348.9 million, $295.2 million and $283.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $53.7 million net increase in 2007 operating income over 2006 is primarily a result of the benefits from the increased sales volume and the impact of the $8.5 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2006 relating to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. This increase was offset by the $12.6 million charge taken in 2007 related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The $12.0 million net increase in 2006 operating income over 2005 is primarily a result of the benefit from the increased sales volume being partially offset by $28.0 million of the additional stock based compensation costs incurred as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, and $8.5 million of restructuring costs incurred relating to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. Operating cash flow was $370.5 million, $263.6 million and $298.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $106.9 million increase in the 2007 operating cash flow as compared to 2006 is primarily the result of higher net income; the leveling off of the inventory ramp up in 2006 for new product introductions and safety stock related to outsourcing; and the timing of payments to vendors. Included in the 2006 operating cash flow was a 18 Table of Contents $9.0 million tax payment associated with the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), a $3.5 million litigation payment and $7.0 million of severance and other facility related payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative. The decline in the 2006 operating cash flow as compared to 2005 can be attributed to an increase in inventories of $29.9 million over 2005. The 2006 inventory increase is attributable to the ramp up of new product introductions and an increase in the safety stock levels resulting from the outsourcing of the Alliance instrument system manufacturing. Operating cash flows continue to benefit from the improvement in accounts receivable collection measured in days sales outstanding (DSO). DSOs were 66 days, 64 days and 70 days at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $60.3 million, $51.4 million and $51.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar Instruments, Inc., a privately held global leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $3.5 million in cash. In August 2007, the Company paid $7.1 million in cash, including the assumption of $1.1 million of liabilities, for CSC. In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 3.4 million shares at a cost of $200.5 million under the February 2007 and October 2005 stock repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels and invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales Net sales for 2007 and 2006 were $1,473.0 million and $1,280.2 million, respectively, an increase of 15%. Foreign currency translation benefited sales growth for 2007 by 3%. Product sales were $1,072.9 million and $922.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 16%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry consumables and the effect of acquisitions. The impact of the 2006 acquisitions accounted for 2% of the product sales growth in 2007. Service sales were $400.2 million and $357.7 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 12%. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to growth in the Companys installed base of instruments and higher sales of service contracts. Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division net sales grew 14% in 2007. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales growth by 3%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 24% in 2007. This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology products, new XBridgetm columns, Oasis sample preparation products and the sales associated with the 2006 acquisitions (Environmental Resources Associates (ERA) and VICAM Limited Partnership (VICAM) product lines). These acquisitions benefited the chemistry consumable sales growth rate by 9%. Waters Division service sales grew 11% in 2007 due to increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales (LC and MS) grew 13% in 2007. The increase in instrument systems sales during 2007 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC systems and Synapt HDMS system sales. Waters Division sales by product mix were essentially unchanged in 2007 and 2006 with instrument systems, chemistry and service representing approximately 56%, 17% and 27%, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia strengthened approximately 15%, 16% and 10% in 2007, respectively. Sales to the rest of the world increased 10% in 2007. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 9% in Europe and increased sales growth in Asia by 1% in 2007. U.S., Europe and Asia sales growth in 2007 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The growth in Europe was broad based across most major countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. Asias growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China which was offset by a 1% sales decrease in Japan. Japans 2007 instrument systems and consumable sales were impacted by strong 2006 sales attributed to drinking water and food safety regulation changes. 19 Table of Contents TA Division Net Sales TAs sales grew 27% in 2007 primarily as a result of TAs new product introductions, strong sales growth in the U.S. and Europe and expansion of its Asian businesses, as well as a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007. The sales growth rate in 2007 also benefited from the CSC and Thermometric acquisitions which added 4% to the TA sales growth rate. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales growth by 3% in 2007. Instrument system sales grew 29% and represented approximately 70% and 69% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. TA service sales grew 23% in 2007 and can be primarily attributed to the higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales growth for 2007 was predominantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2007 was $841.9 million compared to $744.0 million for 2006, an increase of $97.9 million, or 13%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 57.2% in 2007 from 58.1% in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to increased sales of new products which have higher manufacturing costs and the unfavorable foreign currency impact related to the cost of products manufactured in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by $2.6 million related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 were $403.7 million and $357.7 million, respectively, an increase of 13%. Included in selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is a $7.4 million charge related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining $38.6 million increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is primarily due to annual merit increases across most divisions; headcount additions to support the increased sales volume; costs from new acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.4% for 2007 compared to 27.9% for 2006. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $80.6 million and $77.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $3.3 million, or 4%. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the $2.2 million charge related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. 2006 Restructuring In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan, primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world. The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges in connection with the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. The following is a summary of activity of the Companys restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, December 31, 2006 Charges Utilization 2007 Severance $ 1,433 $ $ (667 ) $ 766 Other 48 (48 ) Total $ 1,481 $ $ (715 ) $ 766 Other Expense, Net In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $5.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Caprion). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the Company learned that Caprions financial condition had deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the 20 Table of Contents Companys assessment, would result in the Companys investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007, Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Thallion). Thallion is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Companys investment is accounted for under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The market value of the Thallion investment was approximately $0.3 million and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest Expense Interest expense was $56.5 million and $51.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt during 2007. Interest Income Interest income was $30.8 million and $25.3 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes In January 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). This interpretation prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure, report, present and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take. See Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Companys effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 17.1% and 15.5%, respectively. This net increase is primarily attributable to increased net income in jurisdictions with comparatively higher tax rates. Included in the 2007 tax provision is a tax benefit of $4.4 million associated with the charge related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales Net sales for 2006 and 2005 were $1,280.2 million and $1,158.2 million, respectively, an increase of 11%. Foreign currency translation benefited the 2006 sales growth rate by less than 1%. Product sales were $922.5 million and $834.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems sales, chemistry consumables sales and the effect of acquisitions. Service sales were $357.7 million and $323.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in the Companys installed base of instruments and higher sales of service contracts. Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division sales grew 11% in 2006. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales growth by less than 1%. Chemistry consumables sales grew approximately 18% in 2006. This growth was primarily driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology, new XBridge columns, Oasis sample preparation products and the sales associated with the acquired VICAM product line. Waters Division service sales grew 9% in 2006 primarily due to increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales grew 9% in 2006. The increase in Waters instrument system sales during 2006 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC systems and higher MS triple quadrupole system sales, offset by a decline in lower end MS systems sales. Waters Division sales by product mix were essentially unchanged in 2006 and 2005 with instruments, chemistry and service representing approximately 57%, 16% and 27%, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales in Asia, Europe and the U.S. strengthened approximately 19%, 12% and 4% in 2006, respectively. Sales to the rest of the world increased 5% in 2006. The effects of foreign currency translation decreased sales growth in Asia by 3% and increased sales growth by 2% in Europe in 2006. Asias growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China while the growth in 21 Table of Contents Europe was broad based across most major countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. U.S. sales growth in 2006 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical and industrial customers. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales grew 9% in 2006 primarily as a result of TAs new product introductions and expansion of its Asian businesses. Foreign currency translation had no impact to this overall sales growth rate. Instrument system sales grew 4% as TA introduced four new differential scanning calorimeters during 2006 and, in late August 2006, the Company entered the field of micro calorimetry through the acquisition of Thermometric. Instrument system sales represented approximately 69% and 73% of sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. TA service sales grew 22% in 2006 and can be attributed to the increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales growth for 2006 was predominantly in Europe and Asia. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2006 was $744.0 million compared to $679.9 million for 2005, an increase of $64.1 million, or 9%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 58.1% in 2006 from 58.7% in 2005. The 2006 gross profit was negatively impacted by $4.3 million of stock based compensation costs relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The remaining slight decrease in gross profit percentage in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to product transition costs to Singapore and product introduction costs on new MS instruments. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2006 and 2005 were $357.7 million and $321.7 million, respectively, an increase of 11%. The $36.0 million increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2006 is primarily due to additional stock based compensation costs of $18.6 million; annual merit increases across most divisions and headcount additions to support the increased sales volume. Other increases in selling and administration expenses were offset by decreases related to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. The Company made investments in Asia, largely in the second half of 2006, in support of growing business opportunities. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.9% for 2006 compared to 27.8% for 2005. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $77.3 million and $66.9 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, an increase of $10.4 million, or 16%. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to stock based compensation costs of $5.1 million relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The remaining increases in research and development expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily reflects the costs of introducing multiple new MS instruments in the second half of 2006. 2006 Restructuring In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan, primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world. The following is a summary of activity of the Companys restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, December 31, 2005 Charges Utilization 2006 Severance $ $ 6,443 $ (5,010 ) $ 1,433 Other 2,041 (1,993 ) 48 Total $ $ 8,484 $ (7,003 ) $ 1,481 22 Table of Contents Litigation Provisions Litigation provisions in 2005 were $3.1 million relating to patent litigation with Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Agilent). This patent litigation was settled in February 2006 and recorded in the 2005 statement of operations. No additional provisions were made in 2006. Other Expense, Net In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $5.8 million charge for an other than temporary impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Caprion). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the Company learned that Caprions financial condition had deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the Companys assessment, would result in the Companys investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007, Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Thallion). Thallion is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Companys investment is accounted for under SFAS No. 115. The market value of the Thallion investment was approximately $1.7 million as of December 31, 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold all of its equity investment in Nuvelo, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company also recorded a $4.8 million pre tax charge for an other than temporary impairment for the full value of the Companys investment in Beyond Genomics, Inc. This charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of Beyond Genomics, Inc.s financial condition. Interest Expense Interest expense was $51.7 million and $24.7 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to increases in interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt and an increase in average borrowings in the U.S. to fund the stock repurchase programs. Interest Income Interest income was $25.3 million and $19.3 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher interest rate yields. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 15.5% and 26.4%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is the effect of $24.0 million of income tax expense related to the repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA. The remaining decrease in the effective tax rates for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to increased income in jurisdictions with comparatively low tax rates. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit at a higher effective tax rate in 2006. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005 Net income $ 268,072 $ 222,200 $ 201,975 Depreciation and amortization 53,317 46,159 43,685 Stock based compensation 28,855 28,813 765 Deferred income taxes 5,946 506 10,235 Tax benefit related to stock option plans 4,872 Change in accounts receivable (26,266 ) (7,210 ) (4,041 ) Change in inventories (6,368 ) (29,853 ) (6,973 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 32,309 1,670 26,802 Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 6,244 1,230 7,551 Other changes 8,398 79 13,196 Net cash provided by operating activities 370,507 263,594 298,067 Net cash used in investing activities (167,907 ) (130,374 ) (51,045 ) Net cash used in financing activities (119,686 ) (125,906 ) (272,015 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 253 13,264 (20,496 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 83,167 $ 20,578 $ (45,489 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities was $370.5 million and $263.6 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $106.9 million increase in net cash provided from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2007 as compared to 2006. DSO increased to 66 days at December 31, 2007 from 64 days at December 31, 2006. Inventory growth was much lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to 2006 having a higher ramp up of new products launched later in that year and the increased levels of Alliance inventory during the 2006 outsourcing transition to Singapore. The 2007 changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities and other changes compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the reclassification within these line items of certain income tax liabilities from current to long term liabilities required by the adoption of FIN 48. The overall net change in these items can be attributed to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing of payments to vendors, an increase in income tax liabilities and an increase in accrued compensation resulting from the $12.6 million transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan partially offset by the reduction in the pension liability relating to the freezing of the U.S. Pension Plans. The one time transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan will be made in the first quarter of 2008. The change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was also impacted by a tax payment in 2006 in the amount of $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation of cash under the AJCA. No such payment was made in 2007. Also, included in the change in accounts payable and other current liabilities in 2006 were $7.0 million of severance and other facility related payments in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a litigation payment of $3.5 million to settle the Agilent litigation. 24 Table of Contents Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2007 and 2006 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities was $263.6 million and $298.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $34.5 million decline in net cash provided from operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 is attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income and the impact of stock compensation under SFAS No. 123(R): The change in accounts receivable in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2006 as compared to 2005. DSO decreased to 64 days at December 31, 2006 from 70 days at December 31, 2005. The change in inventory in 2006 compared to 2005 results from the increase in inventory due to the ramp up of new MS products, an increase in LC instrument inventory associated with the transition to higher production levels of ACQUITY systems from Alliance systems and a planned increase in the Alliance inventory levels during the outsourcing transition. The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by cash payments made on increased inventory levels, severance and other facility related payments of $7.0 million in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a litigation payment of $3.5 million to settle the Agilent litigation. Also included in the change in accounts payable and other current liabilities in 2006 was a tax payment in the amount of $9.0 million related to the distribution and repatriation of cash under the AJCA. During 2005, the income tax accrual was increased by $24.0 million resulting from the repatriation of funds under the AJCA. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2006 and 2005 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. 2006 net cash provided by operating activities as compared to 2005 was impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Under SFAS No. 123(R), $16.5 million of benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as cash from financing activities in 2006; prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), this benefit of $4.9 million in 2005 was reported as part of cash from operating activities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $167.9 million in 2007 compared to $130.4 million in 2006 and $51.0 million in 2005. Additions to fixed assets and software capitalization were $60.3 million in 2007, $51.4 million in 2006 and $51.0 million in 2005. Capital spending and software capitalization additions were consistent with capital spending trends and expectations throughout the respective years to accommodate the Companys growth. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $9.1 million and $79.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, in 2007, the Company received $0.7 million from the former shareholders of ERA in connection with the finalization of the purchase price in accordance with the purchase and sales agreement. There were no business acquisitions in 2005. In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar Instruments, Inc., a privately held global leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $3.5 million in cash. During 2007, the Company purchased a net $95.7 million of short term investments. Cash Used in Financing Activities In January 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement (the 2007 Credit Agreement). The 2007 Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million term loan facility; a $350 million revolving facility (U.S. Tranche), which includes both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility; and a $250 million revolving facility (European Tranche) that is available to Waters Corporation in U.S. dollars and Waters Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either U.S. dollars or Euros. Waters Corporation may on one or more 25 Table of Contents occasions request of the lender group that commitments for the U.S. Tranche or European Tranche be increased by an amount of not less than $25 million, up to an aggregate additional amount of $250 million. Existing lenders are not obligated to increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving facilities both mature on January 11, 2012 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. In January 2007, the Company borrowed $500 million under the new term loan facility, $115 million under the new European Tranche and $270 million under the new U.S. Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay the outstanding amounts under the Companys previous multi borrower credit agreements entered into in December 2004 and November 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such agreements early without penalty. The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. The facility fee on the 2007 Credit Agreement ranges between 7 basis points and 15 basis points. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively, the same as the terminated credit agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in nature to those in the terminated credit agreements. During 2007, the Companys net debt borrowings decreased by $19.3 million compared to an increase of $72.2 million in 2006 and $369.6 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $865.0 million borrowed under the credit agreement dated as of January 2007 and an amount available to borrow of $233.2 million after outstanding letters of credit. In August 2007, the Company entered into two new floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50.0 million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. The maturity dates of the swaps are April 2009 and October 2009. In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2007, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares at a cost of $166.1 million under this program, leaving $333.9 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company repurchased 3.4 million, 5.8 million and 15.4 million shares at a cost of $200.5 million, $249.2 million and $659.3 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, under the February 2007 and previously announced programs. The Company received $91.4 million, $39.9 million and $16.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from stock option exercises were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2005 and are believed to be attributable to the increase in the Companys stock price. The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $597.3 million and the short term investments balance of $95.7 million as of December 31, 2007 and expected cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by Standard Poors and P1 by Moodys Investors Service; bank deposits; repurchase agreements; U.S. Government Agency Debt and AAA rated money market funds. Similar 26 Table of Contents investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset backed conduits. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Long term debt(1) $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ $ 500,000 $ $ Operating leases 94,247 23,683 19,524 15,771 12,022 9,247 5,105 8,895 Other long term liabilities(2) Total $ 594,247 $ 23,683 $ 19,524 $ 15,771 $ 12,022 $ 509,247 $ 5,105 $ 8,895 Amount of Commitments Expiration per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Letters of credit $ 1,757 $ 1,757 $ $ $ $ $ $ (1) The interest rates applicable to any U.S. borrowings under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. At current and long term debt levels and interest rates consistent with those at December 31, 2007, the Companys interest expense would be approximately $44.0 million annually, which is not disclosed in the above table. (2) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid for licenses were approximately $0.3 million in 2007, $0.6 million in 2006 and $0.8 million in 2005. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2007 are immaterial. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2008, the Company expects to contribute approximately $3.5 million to $7.0 million to the Companys pension plans. Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be at similar levels expended in 2007 to support the growth in the business. FIN 48, which became effective on January 1, 2007, requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2007 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $67.0 million in the income tax provision. As of December 31, 2007, however, the Company is not able to estimate the portion of that total potential reduction that may occur within the next twelve months. As a result, this information is not disclosed in the above table. 27 Table of Contents The Company is not aware of any undisclosed risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, product technical obsolescence, regulatory compliance, protection of intellectual property rights, changes in pharmaceutical industry spending, competitive advantages, current and pending litigation, and changes in foreign exchange rates, that are reasonably likely to occur and could materially and negatively affect the Companys existing cash balance or its ability to borrow funds from its credit facility. The Company also believes there are no provisions in its credit facilities, its real estate leases or supplier and collaborative agreements that would accelerate payments, require additional collateral or impair its ability to continue to enter into critical transactions. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Once the product is shipped, all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2007, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $87.3 million and $13.3 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial 28 Table of Contents Statements. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant post delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2007 was $317.8 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $9.6 million. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders; and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2007 was $175.9 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $11.3 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and, significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patent, trademark and intellectual properties, such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Net intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill amounted to $141.8 million, $160.9 million and $272.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during 2007 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there 29 Table of Contents can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2007, the Companys warranty liability was $13.1 million. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. The Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 were $68.5 million. Litigation As described in Item 3 of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. Pension and Other Retirement Benefits Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the Companys benefit obligation and expense. 30 Table of Contents At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2007 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2007, the Company determined this rate to be 6.40% for the Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the Companys 2007 benefit obligation and 2008 expense. Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the Companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by approximately $0.3 million. A one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by approximately $0.2 million. Stock based Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs associated with awards for 2007 and 2006 now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. The after tax stock based compensation and the impact to diluted earnings per share of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $20.0 million with a $0.19 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share and $20.6 million with a $0.20 per share reduction to diluted earnings per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has capitalized stock based compensation costs of $0.4 million and $1.6 million to inventory and capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has capitalized stock based compensation costs of $0.6 million and $1.0 million to inventory and capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, for its plans. Under this accounting method, stock option compensation awards that are granted with the exercise price at the current fair value of the Companys common stock as of the date of the award generally did not require compensation expense to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Stock based compensation expense recognized for the Companys fixed employee stock option plans, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. 31 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): Unrecognized Compensation Weighted Average Costs Life in Years Stock options $ 51.2 3.1 Restricted stock units $ 19.5 4.6 Restricted stock $ 0.4 1.7 Total $ 71.1 3.5 Recent Accounting Standards Changes In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes the methodology by which a company must measure, report, present and disclose in its financial statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting positions that a company has taken or expects to take. The interpretation requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. In addition, the interpretation mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in tax reporting positions. The interpretation is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the Companys financial position. See Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as to the impact of adopting this pronouncement. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This standard addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. This standard is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Relative to SFAS No. 157, the FASB proposed FASB Staff Positions (FSP) 157 a, 157 b and 157 c. FSP 157 a amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions, while FSP 157 b delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. FSP 157 c clarifies the principles in SFAS No. 157 on the fair value measurement of liabilities. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets, liabilities and non controlling interests acquired to be measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the business combination. In addition, this statement expands the scope to include all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 32 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50.0 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of $1.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $200.0 million and maturity date of June 2007, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax realized gain of $0.5 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out the swap, resulting in a pre tax gain of $0.4 million.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $125.0 million and maturity date of 21 months, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt. The Company subsequently closed out the swap in the second quarter of 2004 and $0.9 million of the total $1.6 million realized gain was recognized in earnings in 2005 through the original term of the interest rate swap. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in interest rates, the fair market value of the floating to fixed rate interest rate swap would decrease by approximately $1.3 million. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales denominated in Euros, 9% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2007. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in 33 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding range forward agreements in British Pounds with notional amounts totaling 30.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax gain of $6.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of $5.8 million related to the closed range forward agreements and unrealized gains of $0.3 million related to the open British Pound range forward agreements.

Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $101.4 million, $70.9 million and $72.9 million, respectively.
