Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Companys sales were $1,575 million, $1,473 million and $1,280 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales grew 7% in 2008 over 2007 and 15% in 2007 over 2006. Overall, the sales growth achieved in these years can be primarily attributed to the Companys introduction of new products, the increase in chemistry consumable and service sales, the benefits from acquisitions and the effects of foreign currency translation. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company experienced the effects of reduced capital spending by the Companys customers as a result of the global economic conditions and the sudden strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Company sales growth in the fourth 18 Table of Contents quarter of 2008 decreased from the fourth quarter of 2007 by 4% from the effects of foreign currency translation. The Company expects this effect of foreign currency trend to continue into 2009. During 2008 and 2007, U.S. sales increased 1% and 17%; European sales increased 7% and 17%; Asian sales (including Japan) increased 16% and 12%; and sales in the rest of the world increased 3% and 11%, respectively. The effect of currency translation benefited the 2008 and 2007 sales growth rate by 2% and by 3%, respectively, both increases principally resulting from European sales. In 2008 and 2007, global sales to pharmaceutical customers grew 3% and 13%, respectively. Global sales to government and academic customers were 10% higher in 2008 and 24% higher in 2007 over the prior year, respectively, and can be primarily attributed to demand for the Companys new products in the U.S. and Asia. Global sales to industrial and food safety customers grew 13% in 2008 and 16% in 2007 primarily as a result of new governmental regulatory testing requirements, higher awareness of food safety issues, higher chemistry consumable and service sales, the benefit from acquisitions and demand for the Companys new products. The Waters Division sales grew by 7% in 2008 and 14% in 2007. The Waters Divisions products and services consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, herein referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and chemistry consumable products and related services. The Waters Division sales growth was strongly influenced by ACQUITY UPLC sales, shipments of new Synapttm HDMStm, Xevotm TQ and Synapt MS systems and recurring sales growth from the service and chemistry consumables business. In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of Analytical Products Group, Inc. (APG), a provider of environmental testing products for quality control and proficiency testing used in environmental laboratories, for $5 million in cash. APGs product sales in 2009 are expected to be approximately $4 million. In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar Instruments, Inc. (Thar), a privately held global leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction systems, for $4 million in cash. On February 2, 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar for $36 million, including the assumption of $4 million of debt. The Company expects that Thar will add approximately $20 million of product sales and be about neutral to earnings in 2009 after debt service costs. Sales growth for the TA Division (TA) grew 10% and 25% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. TAs products and services consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. TAs sales growth can be primarily attributed to new product introductions, the effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited sales by 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2007. The July 2008 acquisition of VTI Corporation (VTI) and the August 2007 acquisition of Calorimetry Sciences Corporation (CSC) added 3% to TAs sales growth in 2008. TA sales growth for 2007 also benefited from a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007, as well as the benefit of the CSC acquisition and the 2006 acquisition of Thermometric AB, which added 4% to TAs sales growth. Operating income was $390 million, $349 million and $295 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $41 million net increase in operating income in 2008 over 2007 is primarily a result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume, the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of a one time $12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a 401(k) defined contribution plan for U.S. employees. This 2008 increase was partially offset by a patent litigation provision of $7 million and the $9 million impact of an out of period capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during the three months ended June 28, 2008. The $54 million net increase in operating income in 2007 over 2006 is primarily a result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume and the impact of $8 million of restructuring costs recorded in 2006 relating to the February 2006 cost reduction initiative being offset by the $12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the transitional contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. Net income per diluted share was $3.21, $2.62 and $2.13 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew at a rate of 23% in both 2008 over 2007 and 2007 over 2006, respectively. During the second quarter of 2008, the Company identified errors originating in periods prior to the three months ended June 28, 2008. The errors primarily related to (i) an overstatement of the Companys income tax 19 Table of Contents expense of $16 million as a result of errors in recording its income tax provision during the period from 2000 to March 29, 2008 and (ii) an understatement of amortization expense of $9 million for certain capitalized software. The Company incorrectly calculated its provision for income taxes by tax effecting its tax liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an Irish tax rate of 10%. In addition, the Company incorrectly accounted for Irish based capitalized software and the related amortization expense as U.S. Dollar denominated instead of Euro denominated, resulting in an understatement of amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment. The out of period adjustment increased the 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08. In addition, the Company recorded a one time $5 million tax provision in the third quarter of 2008 associated with the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities in October 2008. This $5 million tax provision decreased net income per diluted share by $0.05 in 2008. These entities were effectively liquidated into the U.S. to better align the Companys legal entity structure with its current business objectives. The majority of this legal entity reorganization qualifies as a tax free liquidation and it resulted in the Company being able to utilize $572 million of cash and short term investments domestically. In February 2009, the U.S. Treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations that eliminate concerns with respect to the $5 million unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the third quarter of 2008 through the Companys tax provision. Because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated during the first quarter of 2009, the Company will record this $5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and, therefore, as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2009. In October 2008, the Company utilized the cash from the reorganization described above to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan under the credit agreement entered into in March 2008 (the 2008 Credit Agreement). There was no penalty for prepaying the term loan and the repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company utilized these cash balances to voluntarily repay $340 million of revolving outstanding debt under the credit agreement entered into in January 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement). The Company prepaid debt in order to reduce the Companys exposure to leverage and interest rate risk in the currently volatile capital and investment markets. The Company also recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies, Inc. This litigation provision decreased net income per diluted share by $0.04 in 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million, $371 million and $264 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $47 million increase in operating cash flow in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily the result of higher net income and improved cash collections from customers, partially offset by a $13 million one time transition benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan that was expensed in 2007, increases in inventory and the timing of payments to vendors. The $107 million increase in operating cash flow in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily the result of higher net income, the leveling off of an inventory ramp up in 2006 for new product introductions and an increase in safety stock related to the outsourcing to Singapore and the timing of payments to vendors. In addition, the 2006 operating cash flow included a $9 million tax payment associated with the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), $7 million of severance and other facility related payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a $4 million litigation payment. Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $69 million, $60 million and $51 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In December 2008, the Company acquired the net assets of APG for $5 million in cash. In July 2008, the Company paid $3 million in cash to acquire the net assets of VTI. In August 2007, the Company paid $7 million in cash, including the assumption of $1 million of liabilities, for CSC. In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar for $4 million in cash. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $29 million, $91 million and $40 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily attributed to the change in the Company stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company repurchased 4.1 million, 3.4 million and 5.8 million shares at a cost of $235 million, $201 million and $249 million under the February 2007 authorization 20 Table of Contents and previously announced stock repurchase programs. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels and invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Sales Net sales for 2008 and 2007 were $1,575 million and $1,473 million, respectively, an increase of 7%. Foreign currency translation benefited sales growth for 2008 by 2%. Product sales were $1,140 million and $1,088 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 5%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry consumables and foreign currency translation benefits. Service sales were $435 million and $385 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers and foreign currency translation benefits. Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division net sales grew 7% in 2008. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a benefit to total sales growth of 2%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 9% in 2008. This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology and sales of HPLC columns. Waters Division service sales grew 12% in 2008 due primarily to increased sales of service plans and billings to the higher installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales (LC and MS) grew 3% in 2008. The increase in instrument systems sales during 2008 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC, Synapt HDMS, Synapt MS and the Xevo TQ. Sales were negatively impacted by the slowdown in industrial customer spending which occurred during fourth quarter of 2008 due to the economic recession. Waters Division sales by product line were essentially unchanged in 2008 and 2007 with instrument systems, chemistry consumables and service representing approximately 55%, 17% and 28% of sales, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world grew approximately 6%, 17% and 4% in 2008, respectively. Sales to the U.S. were flat in 2008. The sales growth in 2008 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys government, academic and industrial customers. Asias sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales growth in Europe and Asia by 4% and 5% in 2008, respectively. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales grew 10% in 2008 primarily as a result of new product introductions, acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translation. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales growth by 2% in 2008. Instrument system sales grew 6% and represented approximately 78% and 81% of sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. TA service sales grew 27% in 2008 and can be primarily attributed to the higher installed base of customers and new service sales to the customers of recently acquired companies. Geographically, sales growth for TA in 2008 was predominantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The July 2008 VTI acquisition and the August 2007 acquisition of CSC added 3% to TAs sales growth for 2008. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2008 was $914 million compared to $842 million for 2007, an increase of $72 million, or 9%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0% in 2008 from 57.2% in 2007. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volume, increased comparative benefits of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Also, the overall gross profit increase was negatively impacted by a $9 million out of period capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during 2008. The gross profit increase can also be attributed to the $3 million expense recorded in 2007 relating to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. 21 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 were $427 million and $404 million, respectively, an increase of 6%. Included in selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is the impact of a one time $7 million expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining $16 million increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2008 is primarily due to annual merit increases, modest headcount additions to support increased sales volume and the comparative unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2008 compared to 27.4% for 2007. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $82 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $1 million, or 1%. Included in research and development expenses for 2007 is $2 million of expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining increase in research and development expenses for 2008 is primarily due to the timing of new product introduction costs, annual merit increases and modest headcount additions. Litigation Provision The Company has recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies Inc. Interest Expense Interest expense was $39 million and $57 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowing costs and lower average borrowings during 2008 as compared to 2007. Interest Income Interest income was $21 million and $31 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower yields and lower cash and short term investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. The 2008 effective tax rate includes a $5 million tax provision associated with the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. This one time provision increased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points for 2008. In February 2009, the U.S. Treasury promulgated changes in income tax regulations that eliminate concerns with respect to the $5 million unrecognized tax benefit that was originally recorded in the third quarter of 2008 through the Companys tax provision. Because these changes in income tax regulations were promulgated during the first quarter of 2009, the Company will record this $5 million item as a recognized tax benefit and, therefore, as a reduction of its income tax provision for the first quarter of 2009. The 2008 tax provision also contains out of period adjustments to correct errors relating to capitalized software amortization and the income tax provision. The $16 million tax benefit from the out of period adjustments reduced the Companys effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points for 2008. The 2007 tax provision includes a $4 million tax benefit associated with a one time contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining decrease in the effective tax rate for 2008 is primarily attributable to proportionately greater growth in income in jurisdictions with comparatively lower effective tax rates. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales Net sales for 2007 and 2006 were $1,473 million and $1,280 million, respectively, an increase of 15%. Foreign currency translation benefited sales growth for 2007 by 3%. Product sales were $1,088 million and $936 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 16%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry consumables and the effect of acquisitions. The impact of 2006 acquisitions accounted for 2% of the product sales growth in 2007. Service sales were $385 million 22 Table of Contents and $344 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 12%. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to growth in the Companys installed base of instruments and higher sales of service contracts. Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division net sales grew 14% in 2007. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division sales growth by 3%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 24% in 2007. This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology products, new XBridgetm columns, Oasis sample preparation products and sales associated with the 2006 acquisitions (Environmental Resources Associates (ERA) and VICAM Limited Partnership (VICAM) product lines). These acquisitions benefited the chemistry consumable sales growth rate by 9%. Waters Division service sales grew 11% in 2007 due to increased sales of service plans to the higher installed base of customers. Waters instrument systems sales grew 13% in 2007. The increase in instrument systems sales during 2007 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC and Synapt HDMS system sales. Waters Division sales by product mix were essentially unchanged in 2007 and 2006 with instrument systems, chemistry and service representing approximately 56%, 17% and 27% of sales, respectively. Geographically, Waters Division sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia strengthened approximately 15%, 16% and 10% in 2007, respectively. Sales to the rest of the world increased 10% in 2007. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales growth by 9% in Europe and increased sales growth in Asia by 1% in 2007. U.S., Europe and Asia sales growth in 2007 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical and industrial customers. The growth in Europe was broad based across most major countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. Asias growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China which was offset by a 1% sales decrease in Japan. Japans 2007 instrument systems and consumable sales were impacted by strong 2006 sales attributed to drinking water and food safety regulation changes. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales grew 25% in 2007 primarily as a result of TAs new product introductions, strong sales growth in the U.S. and Europe and expansion of its Asian businesses, as well as a larger than normal backlog of orders in 2006 which were shipped in the first quarter of 2007. The sales growth rate in 2007 also benefited from the CSC and Thermometric acquisitions which added 4% to the TA sales growth rate. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales growth by 3% in 2007. Instrument system sales grew 25% and represented approximately 81% of sales in both 2007 and 2006, respectively. TA service sales grew 25% in 2007 and can be primarily attributed to the higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales growth for 2007 was strongest in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2007 was $842 million compared to $744 million for 2006, an increase of $98 million, or 13%, and is generally consistent with the increase in net sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 57.2% in 2007 from 58.1% in 2006. This decrease is primarily due to increased sales of new products which have higher manufacturing costs and the unfavorable foreign currency impact related to the cost of products manufactured in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by the $3 million expense recorded in 2007 related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 were $404 million and $358 million, respectively, an increase of 13%. Included in selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is a $7 million expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining $39 million increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is primarily due to annual merit increases across most divisions, headcount additions to support increased sales volume, costs from new acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.4% for 2007 compared to 27.9% for 2006. 23 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of $4 million, or 4%. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the $2 million expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. 2006 Restructuring In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan, primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all of which had left the Company as of December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its operating costs with business opportunities around the world. The Company does not expect to incur any additional charges in connection with the February 2006 cost reduction initiative. The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys restructuring liability included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands): Balance Balance December 31, December 31, 2006 Charges Utilization 2007 Severance $ 1,433 $ $ (667 ) $ 766 Other 48 (48 ) Total $ 1,481 $ $ (715 ) $ 766 Other Expense, Net In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a $6 million charge for an other than temporary impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Caprion). The charge was recorded in 2006 when the Company learned that Caprions financial condition had deteriorated and a merger was in process that, in the Companys assessment, would result in the Companys investment being substantially diminished. In March 2007, Caprion merged with Ecopia BioSciences Inc. and is now named Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Thallion). Thallion is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Companys investment is accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The market value of the Thallion investment was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2007 and was $2 million as of December 31 2006. Interest Expense Interest expense was $57 million and $52 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings in the U.S. to fund stock repurchase programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in interest rates on the Companys outstanding debt during 2007. Interest Income Interest income was $31 million and $25 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 17.1% and 15.5%, respectively. This net increase is primarily attributable to increased net income in jurisdictions with comparatively higher tax rates. Included in the 2007 tax provision is a tax benefit of $4 million associated with the charge related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net income $ 322,479 $ 268,072 $ 222,200 Depreciation and amortization 65,271 53,317 46,159 Stock based compensation 30,782 28,855 28,813 Deferred income taxes (19,626 ) 5,946 506 Change in accounts receivable 21,739 (26,266 ) (7,210 ) Change in inventories (20,618 ) (6,368 ) (29,853 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (19,970 ) 32,309 1,670 Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 1,976 6,244 1,230 Other changes 36,215 8,398 79 Net cash provided by operating activities 418,248 370,507 263,594 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 18,811 (167,907 ) (130,374 ) Net cash used in financing activities (572,938 ) (119,686 ) (125,906 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (32,932 ) 253 13,264 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (168,811 ) $ 83,167 $ 20,578 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million and $371 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $47 million increase in net cash provided from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2008 as compared to 2007. Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 63 days at December 31, 2008 from 66 days at December 31, 2007. The change in inventories in 2008 and 2007 is attributable to the increase in sales volume and an increase in ACQUITY UPLC and new mass spectrometry and TA products. The 2008 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes a $13 million one time transition pension benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The 2007 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes the accrual related to the one time transition benefit. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of the timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2008 and 2007 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities was $371 million and $264 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $107 million increase in net cash provided from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is attributed 25 Table of Contents primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2007 as compared to 2006. DSO increased to 66 days at December 31, 2007 from 64 days at December 31, 2006. Inventory growth was much lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to 2006 having a higher ramp up of new products launched later in that year and the increased levels of Alliance inventory during the 2006 outsourcing transition to Singapore. The changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities and other changes in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the reclassification within these line items of certain income tax liabilities from current to long term liabilities required by the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). See Note 10, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The overall net change in these items can be attributed to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing of payments to vendors, an increase in income tax liabilities and an increase in accrued compensation resulting from a $13 million contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan partially offset by the reduction in the pension liability relating to the freezing of the U.S. Pension Plans. The one time contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan was made in the first quarter of 2008. The 2006 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was also impacted by a $9 million tax payment related to the distribution and repatriation of cash under the AJCA, $7 million of severance and other facility related payments made in connection with the cost reduction initiative and a $4 million litigation payment to settle the Agilent litigation. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2007 and 2006 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in 2008 compared to net cash used in investing activities which totaled $168 million in 2007 and $130 million in 2006. Additions to fixed assets and software capitalization were $69 million in 2008, $60 million in 2007 and $51 million in 2006. Capital spending and software capitalization additions were consistent with historical capital spending trends. During 2008 and 2007, the Company purchased $20 million and $391 million of short term investments while $115 million and $295 million of short term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $8 million, $9 million and $79 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, in 2007, the Company received $1 million from the former shareholders of ERA in connection with the finalization of the purchase price in accordance with the purchase and sales agreement. In June 2007, the Company made an equity investment in Thar for $4 million in cash. In October 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase land adjacent to its TA facility in Delaware for approximately $7 million. The Company plans to construct a new 150,000 square foot facility in 2009 that will consolidate TAs existing Delaware operations and accommodate future expansion at a cost of approximately $26 million. In addition, the Company entered into a lease termination agreement with its existing Delaware landlord that requires the Company to pay a lease termination fee of approximately $5 million when the Company vacates the existing leased property. The Company expects to vacate the leased property in the middle of 2009 once the construction of the new facility is complete. Cash Used in Financing Activities During 2008 and 2007, the Companys net debt borrowings decreased by $348 million and $19 million, respectively, compared to an increase of $72 million in 2006. 26 Table of Contents In March 2008, the Company entered into the 2008 Credit Agreement that provides for a $150 million term loan facility. In January 2007, the Company entered into the 2007 Credit Agreement that provides for a $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. Both credit agreements mature on January 11, 2012 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. The interest rates applicable to the 2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 137.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements include negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The 2008 and 2007 Credit Agreements also contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid the term loan in order to reduce interest expense and there was no penalty for prepaying the term loan. The repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008 Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company utilized these cash balances to voluntarily repay $340 million of revolving outstanding debt under the 2007 Credit Agreement. The Company prepaid debt in order to reduce future interest expense since the yield on the Companys existing cash and short term investments had recently declined significantly. There were no penalties for prepaying this debt. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $500 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement that matures in 2012. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount available to borrow under the 2007 Credit Agreement was $599 million after outstanding letters of credit. In February 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased a total of 6.9 million shares at a cost of $402 million under this program, leaving $98 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company repurchased 4.1 million, 3.4 million and 5.8 million shares at a cost of $235 million, $201 million and $249 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, under the February 2007 authorization and previously announced programs. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. The Company received $29 million, $91 million and $40 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to employee stock purchase plan in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Proceeds from stock option exercises were higher in 2007 compared to 2008 and 2006 and are believed to be attributable to the change in the Companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. The Company believes that the cash and cash equivalent balance of $429 million as of December 31, 2008 and expected cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by Standard Poors and P1 by Moodys Investors Service, bank deposits, repurchase agreements, U.S. Government Treasury Bills and AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bill and European government bond money market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry 27 Table of Contents an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Notes payable and debt(1) $ 36,120 $ 36,120 $ $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt(1) 500,000 500,000 Operating leases 90,046 28,031 17,931 13,989 10,057 6,314 5,057 8,667 Other long term liabilities(2) Total $ 626,166 $ 64,151 $ 17,931 $ 13,989 $ 510,057 $ 6,314 $ 5,057 $ 8,667 Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Letters of credit $ 1,437 $ 1,437 $ $ $ $ $ $ (1) The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points. At current and long term debt levels and interest rates consistent with those at December 31, 2008, the Companys interest expense would be approximately $13 million annually, which is not disclosed in the above table. (2) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties which expire at various dates through 2009. Fees paid for licenses were less than $1 million each in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2008 are immaterial. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2009, the Company expects to contribute approximately $7 million to $11 million to the Companys defined benefit plans. Capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to be higher than in 2008 due to the construction of the new TA facility which is estimated to cost approximately $33 million in total. Capital expenditures excluding the TA facility are expected to be about the same in 2009 as in 2008. FIN 48, which became effective on January 1, 2007, requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2008 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $76 million in the income tax provision. As of December 31, 2008, however, the Company is not able to estimate the portion of that total potential reduction that may occur within the next twelve months. As a result, this information is not disclosed in the above table. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. 28 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2008, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of approximately $87 million and $14 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98 9, Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, 29 Table of Contents With Respect to Certain Transactions. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically no significant post delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2008 was $292 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $8 million. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders; and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2008 was $173 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $12 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and, significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the Companys current business model. Net intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill amounted to $150 million, $172 million and $268 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during the fourth quarter of 2008 and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2008, the Companys warranty liability was $10 million. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. The Companys unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 were $77 million. Litigation As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. Pension and Other Retirement Benefits Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 8.00% for its Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the Companys benefit obligation and expense. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2008 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2008, the Company determined this rate to be 6.38% for the Waters Retirement Plan, which is the majority of the Companys 2008 benefit obligation and 2009 expense. Retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the Companys defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one quarter percentage point increase in the 31 Table of Contents assumed long term rate of return would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. Stock based Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. This standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R), the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under SFAS No. 123(R) and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. As of December 31, 2008, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): Unrecognized Compensation Weighted Average Costs Life in Years Stock options $ 41 3.3 Restricted stock units $ 25 3.4 Restricted stock $ 1 1.6 Total $ 67 3.3 Recent Accounting Standards Changes In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The Company did not elect to re measure any of its existing financial assets or liabilities under the provisions of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. This revised standard requires assets, liabilities and non controlling interests acquired to be measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the business combination. In addition, this statement expands the scope to include all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2009. Adoption is not expected to materially impact the Companys consolidated financial position or 32 Table of Contents results of operations directly when it becomes effective, as the only impact that the standard will have on recorded amounts at that time relates to disposition of uncertain tax positions related to prior acquisitions. Following adoption, the resolution of such items at values that differ from recorded amounts will be adjusted through earnings rather than through goodwill. Adoption of this statement is, however, expected to have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions subsequent to January 1, 2009 are reflected in the financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows when it becomes effective, but may affect the accounting for non controlling (or minority) interests from that date forward. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is intended to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure requirements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. This FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The objective of this FSP is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R) and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This FSP applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise, and shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in accordance with GAAP. With the issuance of this statement, the FASB concluded that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor, and reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB as opposed to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement on Auditing Standards No. 69, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to U.S. Auditing Standards Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. This FSP amends the standard to provide guidance on employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The provisions of this FSP are not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company 33 Table of Contents attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Hedge Transactions The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Companys objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of $2 million and $1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively, on these interest rate swap agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap, with a notional amount of $200 million and maturity date of June 2007, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax realized gain of $1 million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out the swap, resulting in a pre tax gain of less than $1 million. The gain was deferred and was recognized in earnings in 2007 over the original term of the interest rate swap. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 35% of its sales denominated in Euros, 10% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2008. As a 34 Table of Contents result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company. During 2007 and 2006, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from $30 million to $100 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of $10 million. At December 31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding contracts totaled $100 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $11 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of $10 million and unrealized losses of $1 million. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances. Principal hedged currencies primarily include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $120 million, $101 million and $71 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $23 million, which consists of realized losses of $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $2 million, which consists of realized gains of $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $4 million, which consists of realized gains of $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 would decrease earnings by approximately $12 million. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in commercial paper rated A1 or A1+ by Standard Poors and P1 by Moodys Investors Service, bank deposits, repurchase agreements, U.S. Government Treasury Bills and AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bill and European government bond money market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset backed conduits. The Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. 35 Table of Contents
