Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Companys sales were $1,499 million, $1,575 million and $1,473 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales declined 5% in 2009 as compared with 2008 and sales grew by 7% in 2008 as compared with 2007. Overall, 20 Table of Contents the 2009 decline in sales is primarily due to lower instrument spending by the Companys customers as a result of global economic recessionary conditions and, to a lesser extent, due to the effect of foreign currency translation, which lowered sales by 2% in 2009. Companies acquired in late 2008 and early 2009 added 2% to sales in 2009 as compared to 2008. 2009 instrument system sales declined 10% while recurring sales of chemistry consumables and service increased 2% as compared with 2008, primarily from the effect of acquisitions. The 2008 sales growth as compared to 2007 was primarily attributed to the Companys introduction of new products, the increase in chemistry consumable and service sales and the effects of foreign currency translation. A decline in sales, as compared to the corresponding quarter in the prior year, started in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic recession and continued into the first three quarters of 2009. This decline ended in the fourth quarter of 2009 when sales increased at a rate of 3% over the 2008 fourth quarter. The increase in the 2009 fourth quarter sales is attributed to favorable currency translation, the benefit from acquisitions, a slight improvement in global economic conditions and the introduction of new products. During 2009, as compared to 2008, sales increased 1% in Asia (including Japan) while sales decreased 4% in the U.S., 9% in Europe and 12% in the rest of the world. The effect of currency translation decreased 2009 sales by 2%. During 2008, as compared to 2007, sales increased 1% in the U.S., 7% in Europe, 16% in Asia and 3% in the rest of the world. The effect of currency translation benefited 2008 sales by approximately 2%. In 2009, as compared to 2008, sales to pharmaceutical and industrial and food safety customers decreased 4% and 11%, respectively. These decreases are primarily a result of reduced spending on instrument systems caused by the global economic recession and, to a lesser extent, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in developing economies, including India, South America and Eastern Europe. Global sales to government and academic customers were 5% higher in 2009 and the increase can be primarily attributed to sales of the newly introduced mass spectrometry instrument systems, higher ACQUITY UPLC instrument system sales and global governmental stimulus spending programs. In 2008, as compared to 2007, global sales to pharmaceutical, industrial and food safety, and government and academic customers grew 3%, 13% and 10%, respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to the demand for the Companys new products in the U.S. and Asia, new governmental regulatory testing requirements, higher awareness of food safety issues and higher chemistry consumable and service sales. The Waters Divisions products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and chemistry consumable products and related services. The Waters Division sales decline of 4% in 2009 as compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to weaker demand for instrument systems due to the reduction in capital spending by the Companys customers as a result of the global recession. The Waters Divisions recurring revenue growth from chemistry consumables and service was 2% in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily from the effect of acquisitions. The Waters Division sales grew by 7% in 2008 as compared with 2007. The Waters Division sales growth in 2008 was strongly influenced by ACQUITY UPLC sales, shipments of new Synapttm HDMStm, Xevotm TQ and Synapttm MS systems and recurring revenue growth from the service and chemistry consumables business. In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc. (Thar), a privately held global leader in the design, development and manufacture of analytical and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography and supercritical fluid extraction (SFC) systems, for $36 million in cash, including the assumption of $4 million of debt. The Company had previously made a $4 million equity investment in Thar in June 2007. Thar added approximately $17 million of product sales and was about neutral to earnings in 2009 after debt service costs. Recently acquired companies, both Thar and the 2008 acquisition of Analytical Products Group, Inc. (APG), added 2% to Waters Divisions sales in 2009. The TA Divisions (TA) products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. Sales for TA decreased by 11% in 2009 as compared to 2008. TAs sales decline in 2009 can be primarily attributed to a decrease in spending by the Companys industrial customers as a result of the global economic recession. The July 2008 acquisition of VTI Corporation (VTI) added 1% to TAs sales in 2009 as compared to 2008. TAs 2008 sales growth of 10% as compared to 2007 can be primarily attributed to new product introductions, the effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of acquisitions. Acquisitions 21 Table of Contents and the effect of foreign currency translation added 3% and 2%, respectively, to TAs 2008 sales as compared to 2007. Operating income was $395 million, $390 million and $349 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $5 million net increase in operating income in 2009 over 2008 is primarily a result of the following: Higher gross margins primarily from the net favorable effect of foreign currency translation; Favorable benefits from product sales mix whereas 2009 contained a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables and service sales than 2008; Lower manufacturing costs; and Lower selling, administrative and research and development expenses achieved through tight controls of discretionary spending and lower incentive compensation. These 2009 increases were partially offset by lower gross margin dollars from lower unit volume; lower prices resulting from competitive situations in certain geographies and the impact of $6 million of expense in connection with the TA building lease termination payment and $3 million of severance costs related to a restructuring in Europe. The $41 million net increase in operating income in 2008 over 2007 is primarily the result of the benefits from an increase in sales volume, the favorable effect of foreign currency translation and the impact of a one time $12 million expense recorded in 2007 related to a contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The 2008 increase was partially offset by a patent litigation provision of $7 million and a $9 million impact of an out of period capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during 2008. During 2008, the Company identified errors originating in periods prior to the three months ended June 28, 2008. The errors primarily relate to (i) an overstatement of the Companys income tax expense of $16 million as a result of errors in recording its income tax provision during the period from 2000 to March 29, 2008 and (ii) an understatement of amortization expense of $9 million for certain capitalized software. The Company incorrectly calculated its provision for income taxes by tax effecting its tax liability utilizing a U.S. tax rate of 35% instead of an Irish tax rate of approximately 10%. In addition, the Company incorrectly accounted for Irish based capitalized software and the related amortization expense as U.S. Dollar denominated instead of Euro denominated, resulting in an understatement of amortization expense and cumulative translation adjustment. For 2008, the errors reduced the Companys effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points. In 2009, the Company recorded approximately $5 million of tax benefit associated with the reversal of a $5 million tax provision which was originally recorded in 2008 relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. The tax benefit recognized in 2009 decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points for 2009. The one time tax provision recorded in 2008 increased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. Net income per diluted share was $3.34, $3.21 and $2.62 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net income per diluted share grew at a rate of 4% in 2009 as compared with 2008 and 23% in 2008 as compared with 2007. Net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2009, 2008 and 2007: The benefits of a weaker British Pound on the Companys manufacturing and operating costs. Lower net interest and lower weighted average shares and equivalents, as a result of the Companys share buyback program, increased net income per diluted share in both 2009 as compared with 2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007. As described in the preceding paragraph, the $5 million tax benefit recorded in 2009 added $0.05 per diluted share to 2009 and the $5 million tax provision recorded in 2008 decreased net income per diluted share in 2008 by $0.05. The $6 million TA lease termination payment decreased the 2009 net income per diluted share by $0.04. 22 Table of Contents The impact of the 2008 out of period adjustments related to capitalized software amortization increased the 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08. The one time contribution to the Waters Employee Investment Plan decreased the 2007 net income per diluted share by $0.08. Higher effective tax rates, excluding the items described above, decreased net income per diluted share in 2009 as compared with 2008. Lower effective tax rates, excluding the items described above, increased net income per diluted share in 2008 as compared with 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million, $418 million and $371 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 cash provided by operating activities was consistent with the 2008 cash provided by operating activities despite the lower sales volume and the global economic recession. The $47 million increase in the operating cash flow in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily the result of higher net income and improved cash collections from customers, partially offset by a $13 million one time transition benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan that was expensed in 2007, increases in inventory and the timing of payments to vendors. Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $94 million, $69 million and $60 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2009 is primarily attributed to $28 million spent to acquire land and construct a new TA facility, which was completed in 2009. In February 2009, the Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar for $36 million in cash. The Company made an equity investment in Thar in June 2007 for $4 million in cash. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $19 million, $29 million and $91 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily attributed to changes in the Companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.1 million and 3.4 million shares at a cost of $210 million, $235 million and $201 million, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In addition, in early March 2010, the Company expects to issue and sell ten year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt would mature in February 2020. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt amounts and for general corporate purposes. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Sales Net sales for 2009 and 2008 were $1,499 million and $1,575 million, respectively, a decrease of 5%. The effect of foreign currency translation lowered sales in 2009 by 2%. Product sales were $1,052 million and $1,140 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in product sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the overall decline in Waters and TA instrument system sales due to lower spending by the Companys customers as a result of the global economic recession and adverse effects from foreign currency translation. Service sales were $447 million and $435 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of 3%. The increase in service sales in 2009 as compared with 2008 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. 23 Table of Contents Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division net sales declined 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a decline in total sales of 2%. The 2009 acquisition of Thar and 2008 acquisition of APG added 2% to sales in 2009. Chemistry consumables sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008, with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacting chemistry consumable sales by 2%. Waters Division service sales grew 3% in 2009 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The service sales growth rate was negatively impacted by 1% from the effect of foreign currency translation. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS) declined by 9% in 2009. The decrease in instrument system sales is primarily attributable to weak industrial and pharmaceutical customer spending caused by the global recession. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the 2009 instrument system sales by 2%. Waters Division sales by product line in 2009 were 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service, as compared to 55% for instrument systems, 17% for chemistry consumables and 28% for service in 2008. Waters Division sales in Europe declined 9%, primarily due to weak demand in Eastern Europe and the effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased 2009 sales in Europe by 6%. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 2% in 2009, with strong sales growth in China partially offset by weakness in other Asian markets. The effects of foreign currency translation increased Asias 2009 sales by 2%. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world declined 2% and 13%, respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation decreased 2009 sales in the rest of world by 3%. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales were 11% lower in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of weak instrument system demand from its industrial customers. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on TAs 2009 sales as compared to 2008. The 2008 acquisition of VTI added 1% to sales in 2009. Instrument system sales declined 15% in 2009 and represented 74% of sales in 2009 as compared to 78% in 2008. TA service sales increased by 4% in 2009 due to the increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, TA sales decreased in each market. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2009 was $904 million compared to $914 million for 2008, a decrease of $10 million, or 1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 60.3% in 2009 compared to 58.0% for 2008. The decrease in gross profit dollars in 2009 can be primarily attributed to the lower sales volume and lower prices in certain geographies offset by the benefits from net favorable foreign currency translation, a favorable change in sales mix and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit in 2008 also had a $9 million charge from out of period adjustments related to capitalized software amortization. During 2009, the Companys gross profit as a percentage of sales benefited from the favorable movements in certain foreign exchange rates between the currencies where the Company manufactures and services products and the currencies where the sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was also primarily impacted by the change in sales mix, with 2009 containing a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables and service sales than 2008. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2009 and 2008 were $421 million and $427 million, respectively, a decrease of 1%. The decrease in 2009 selling and administrative expenses is primarily due to tighter control of discretionary spending including no merit increase in 2009, lower incentive compensation and the comparative favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The 2009 decreases were offset by the impact of the $6 million expense incurred in connection with the TA lease termination payment. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 28.1% for 2009 compared to 27.1% for 2008. This percentage increase can be attributed to the lower 2009 sales volume. 24 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $77 million and $82 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of $5 million, or 5%. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2009 is primarily due to the comparative favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Interest Expense Interest expense was $11 million and $39 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowings, as well as significantly lower interest rates during 2009 as compared to 2008. Interest Income Interest income was $3 million and $21 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to significantly lower yields during 2009 as compared to 2008, as well as lower average cash and short term investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 16.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for 2009 is approximately $5 million of tax benefit relating to the reversal of a $5 million provision which was originally recorded in 2008 relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. The $5 million tax benefit decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The one time provision increased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a $16 million benefit resulting from out of period adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The out of period adjustments had the effect of reducing the Companys effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. After consideration of these items, the remaining change in the effective tax rates for 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to changes in income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Sales Net sales for 2008 and 2007 were $1,575 million and $1,473 million, respectively, an increase of 7%. Foreign currency translation benefited sales growth for 2008 by 2%. Product sales were $1,140 million and $1,088 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 5%. The increase in product sales was primarily due to the overall positive growth in Waters and TA instrument systems, chemistry consumables and foreign currency translation benefits. Service sales were $435 million and $385 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in service sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers and foreign currency translation benefits. Waters Division Net Sales The Waters Division net sales grew 7% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a benefit to total sales growth of 2%. Chemistry consumables sales grew 9% in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was driven by increased column sales of ACQUITY UPLC proprietary column technology and sales of HPLC columns. Waters Division service sales grew 12% in 2008 due primarily to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters instrument system sales grew 3% in 2008. The increase in instrument system sales during 2008 is primarily attributable to higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC, Synapt HDMS, Synapt MS and the Xevo TQ. Sales were negatively impacted by the slowdown in industrial customer spending which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the economic recession. Waters Division sales by product line were essentially unchanged in 2008 and 2007 with instrument systems, chemistry consumables and service representing approximately 55%, 17% and 28% of sales, respectively. 25 Table of Contents Geographically, Waters Division sales in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world grew approximately 6%, 17% and 4% in 2008, respectively. Sales in the U.S. were flat in 2008. The sales growth in 2008 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys government, academic and industrial customers. Asias sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales in India and China. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales growth in Europe and Asia by 4% and 5% in 2008, respectively. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales grew 10% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of new product introductions, acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translation. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the TA sales growth by 2% in 2008 as compared to 2007. Instrument system sales grew 6% and represented approximately 78% and 81% of sales in 2008 and 2007, respectively. TA service sales grew 27% in 2008 and can be primarily attributed to a higher installed base of customers and new service sales to the customers of recently acquired companies. Geographically, sales growth for TA in 2008 was predominantly in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The July 2008 VTI acquisition and the August 2007 acquisition of CSC added 3% to TAs sales growth for 2008. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2008 was $914 million compared to $842 million for 2007, an increase of $72 million, or 9%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 58.0% in 2008 compared to 57.2% in 2007. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volume, increased comparative benefits of foreign currency translation and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Also, the overall gross profit increase was negatively impacted by a $9 million out of period capitalized software amortization adjustment recorded during 2008. The gross profit increase can also be attributed to a $3 million expense recorded in 2007 relating to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 were $427 million and $404 million, respectively, an increase of 6%. Included in selling and administrative expenses for 2007 is the impact of a one time $7 million expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining $16 million increase in total selling and administrative expenses for 2008 is primarily due to annual merit increases, modest headcount additions to support increased sales volume and the comparative unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2008 compared to 27.4% for 2007. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $82 million and $81 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $1 million, or 1%. Included in research and development expenses for 2007 is $2 million of expense related to the contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining increase in research and development expenses for 2008 is primarily due to the timing of new product introduction costs, annual merit increases and modest headcount additions. Litigation Provision The Company recorded a $7 million provision in 2008 for damages and fees estimated to be incurred in connection with a judgment issued against the Company relating to an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit with Agilent Technologies Inc. Interest Expense Interest expense was $39 million and $57 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowing costs and lower average borrowings during 2008 as compared to 2007. Interest Income Interest income was $21 million and $31 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower yields and lower cash and short term investment balances. 26 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 13.4% and 17.1%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for 2008 is approximately $5 million of tax provision associated with the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. This one time provision increased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a $16 million benefit resulting from out of period adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The out of period adjustments had the effect of reducing the Companys effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. The 2007 tax provision includes a $4 million tax benefit associated with a one time contribution into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The remaining decrease in the effective tax rate for 2008 is primarily attributable to proportionately greater growth in income in jurisdictions with comparatively lower effective tax rates.

The changes within net cash provided from operating activities in 2009 as compared to 2008 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the lower sales volume in 2009 as compared to 2008. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 67 days at December 31, 2009 from 63 days at December 31, 2008. The change in inventories in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to the decrease in sales volume. The 2009 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes a $6 million litigation payment, which was accrued in 2008. In 2009, the Company also made a $6 million payment to terminate the lease on the old TA facility. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and lower incentive compensation accruals. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in 2009 and 2008 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. 27 Table of Contents Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million and $371 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $47 million increase in net cash provided from operating activities in 2008 as compared to 2007 is attributed primarily to the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided from operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the timing of payments made by customers and the higher sales volume in 2008 as compared to 2007. DSO decreased to 63 days at December 31, 2008 from 66 days at December 31, 2007. The change in inventories in 2008 and 2007 is attributable to the increase in sales volume and an increase in ACQUITY UPLC and new mass spectrometry and TA products. The 2008 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes a $13 million one time transition pension benefit payment into the Waters Employee Investment Plan. The 2007 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes the accrual related to the one time transition benefit. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of the timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2008 and 2007 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes are comprised of the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $419 million in 2009. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $168 million in 2007. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $94 million in 2009, $69 million in 2008 and $60 million in 2007. The increase in capital spending in 2009 can be attributed primarily to $28 million spent to acquire land and construct a new TA facility, which was completed in 2009. Capital spending returned to 2008 levels beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009; however, capital spending may increase periodically in the future in order to fund other facility expansions to accommodate future sales growth. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company purchased $518 million, $20 million and $391 million of short term investments, respectively, while $229 million, $115 million and $295 million of short term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $36 million, $8 million and $9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash Used in Financing Activities In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In addition, in early March 2010, the Company expects to issue and sell ten year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt would mature in February 2020. The Company plans to use the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt amounts and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of the senior unsecured notes are payable semi annually in February and August of each year. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make whole amount. These notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include negative covenants that are similar to the existing credit agreement. These notes also contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. 28 Table of Contents During 2009, the Companys net debt borrowings increased by $92 million. During 2008 and 2007, the Companys net debt borrowings decreased $348 million and $19 million, respectively. In March 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 2008 Credit Agreement) that provided for a $150 million term loan facility. In January 2007, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 2007 Credit Agreement) that provides for a $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. Both credit agreements were to mature on January 11, 2012 and required or require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. The 2007 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had a total of $620 million borrowed under the 2007 Credit Agreement. The Company had $500 million classified as long term debt and $120 million classified as short term debt from this credit agreement and various other lines of credit. The Company has classified the revolving portion of the credit agreement as short term debt as it is the Companys intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount available to borrow under the 2007 Credit Agreement was $479 million after outstanding letters of credit. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2009, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $157 million under this program, leaving $343 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.1 million and 3.4 million shares at a cost of $210 million, $235 million and $201 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and previously announced programs. The Company received $19 million, $29 million and $91 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts are primarily attributed to the changes in the Companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance of $630 million as of December 31, 2009 and expected cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund working capital, capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in bank deposits; U.S., German, French and Dutch Government Treasury Bills; AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bills and European government bond money market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible 29 Table of Contents to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Contractual Obligations(1) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Notes payable and debt $ 131,772 $ 131,772 $ $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 500,000 500,000 Operating leases 83,968 24,039 19,031 14,259 8,934 6,438 4,902 6,365 Total $ 715,740 $ 155,811 $ 19,031 $ 514,259 $ 8,934 $ 6,438 $ 4,902 $ 6,365 Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Letters of credit $ 1,437 $ 1,437 $ $ $ $ $ $ (1) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. At current and long term debt levels and interest rates consistent with those at December 31, 2009, the Companys interest expense would be approximately $5 million annually, which is not disclosed in the above table. The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties, which expire at various dates through 2010. Fees paid for licenses were less than $1 million each in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2009 are immaterial. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2010, the Company expects to contribute approximately $3 million to $5 million to the Companys defined benefit plans. Capital expenditures in 2009 were higher than in 2008 primarily due to the $28 million spent to acquire land and construct a new TA facility, which was completed in 2009. Capital spending is expected to return to 2008 levels in 2010 and may increase periodically in the future in order to fund other facility expansions to accommodate future sales growth. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2009 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $78 million in the income tax provision. The Companys uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods 30 Table of Contents that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the various income tax authorities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company expects that a tax audit of one of the Companys U.K. affiliates tax returns for 2003, 2004 and 2005 will be settled before December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, the Company does not expect the settlement of that audit to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Company has monitored and will continue to monitor the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Other than the aforementioned tax audit, as of December 31, 2009, the Company does not expect to record any material changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the settlement of tax audit examinations or to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the next twelve months. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. Proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys products generally carry one year of warranty. These costs are accrued at the point of shipment. Once the warranty period has expired, the customer may purchase a service contract. Service contract billings are generally invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the contract term and revenue is amortized on a straight line basis over the contract term. At December 31, 2009, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of $95 million and $16 million, respectively. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. Revenues are adjusted accordingly for changes in contract terms or if collectibility is not reasonably assured. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with accounting standards 31 Table of Contents for revenue recognition. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. With respect to installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. The Company believes that this amount approximates the amount that a third party would charge for the installation effort. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. Software revenue is recognized upon shipment, as typically no significant post delivery obligations remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract, with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 was $314 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $7 million. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence; historical demand; projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders; and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2009 was $179 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $13 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and, significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill amounted to $182 million, $211 million and $293 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. The Company performed its annual review during the fourth quarter of 2009 and currently 32 Table of Contents does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Warranty Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2009, the Companys warranty liability was $10 million. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. At December 31, 2009, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $78 million. Litigation As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Companys results of operation or financial position. Pension and Other Retirement Benefits Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.95% for its U.S. benefit plans and 3.34% for its Non U.S. benefit plans. 33 Table of Contents At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2009 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2009, the Company determined the weighted average discount rate to be 5.95% for the U.S. benefit plans and 4.05% for the Non U.S. benefits plans. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. Stock based Compensation The accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the compensation expense that the Company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. As of December 31, 2009, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): Unrecognized Compensation Weighted Average Costs Life in Years Stock options $ 36 3.4 Restricted stock units $ 27 3.2 Restricted stock $ 1 1.5 Total $ 63 3.3 Recent Accounting Standards Changes Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued that establishes the hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that are to be used as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for non governmental entities in preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States. This standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard by the Company did not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents In August 2009, a new accounting standard was issued for measuring liabilities at fair value. This standard provides clarification that, in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods: (1) a valuation technique that uses (a) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or (b) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets; and or (2) a valuation technique that is consistent with GAAP. This standard also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability, a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to provide greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an other than temporary impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an other than temporary impairment event has occurred. This standard applies to debt securities. This standard was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, a new accounting standard was issued to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim as well as in annual financial statements. This standard was effective for periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company implemented the newly issued subsequent events accounting standard. This standard establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued. The adoption of this standard did not impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2009 up through February 26, 2010, the date the Company issued these financial statements. During this period, the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events which have not been disclosed. In December 2008, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. This requirement amends the previous accounting standard to provide guidance on employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This new standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The provisions of this new standard are not required for earlier periods presented and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions on existing accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those in which the accounting and disclosures under existing accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon managements estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. Previously the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the 35 Table of Contents elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software. This consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Hedge Transactions The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance the accounting standard for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the Companys objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Companys financial position and performance. The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Companys objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated 36 Table of Contents balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. At December 31, 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. At both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a $2 million liability in other current liabilities in the consolidated balances sheets related to the interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on these interest rate swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of $1 million and $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, respectively, on these interest rate swap agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded additional interest expense of $2 million, $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively. Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations The Company has operations in various countries and currencies throughout the world, with approximately 33% of its sales denominated in Euros, 11% in Japanese Yen and smaller sales exposures in other currencies in 2009. As a result, the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its stockholders equity balance from the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements, forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys consolidated foreign affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the Company. During 2007, the Company hedged its net investment in Euro foreign affiliates with cross currency interest rate swaps, with notional values ranging from $20 million to $50 million. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no outstanding cross currency interest rate swap contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of $10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of $10 million. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances and short term assets and liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately $138 million, $120 million and $101 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had liabilities of less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31, 2007, the Company had assets of less than $1 million in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $7 million, which consists of realized gains of $5 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $2 million of unrealized gains relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax 37 Table of Contents losses of $23 million, which consists of realized losses of $22 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded cumulative net pre tax gains of $2 million, which consists of realized gains of $3 million relating to the closed forward contracts and $1 million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts. Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2009 would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately $14 million. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of generally 90 days or less, in bank deposits; U.S., German, French and Dutch Government Treasury Bills; AAA rated U.S. Treasury Bills and European government bond money market funds. Similar investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset backed conduits. The Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. 38 Table of Contents
