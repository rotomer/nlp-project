Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: the Waters Division and the TA Division (TA). The Waters Divisions products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC and together with HPLC, referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Companys products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, food safety, academic and governmental customers. 19 Table of Contents These customers use the Companys products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids in consumer goods and healthcare products. The Companys sales were $1,643 million, $1,499 million and $1,575 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales increased 10% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and sales decreased 5% in 2009 as compared to 2008. In 2010, as compared with 2009, instrument system sales increased 12% while combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 7%. These increases in sales were primarily due to higher demand for the Companys products and services resulting from improvement in global economic conditions as compared to the prior year, introduction of new products, including the ACQUITY UPLC H Class, SYNAPT G 2 and Xevo Q Toftm instrument systems, and an increase in pharmaceutical and industrial spending on the Companys LC, MS and TA products. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales in 2010. The 2009 decline in sales as compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower instrument spending by the Companys customers as a result of global economic recessionary conditions and, to a lesser extent, the effect of foreign currency translation. Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010 and decreased sales by 2% in 2009. TAs sales increased 17% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 11% in 2009 as compared to 2008. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on TAs sales in 2010 and 2009. During 2010, as compared with 2009, sales increased 21% in Asia (including Japan), 9% in the U.S. and 13% in the rest of the world, while sales were flat in Europe. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2010 by 4% in Europe and increased sales by 4% in Asia and 3% in the rest of the world. During 2009, as compared with 2008, sales increased 1% in Asia while sales decreased 4% in the U.S., 9% in Europe and 12% in the rest of the world. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2009 by 6% in Europe and 3% in the rest of the world and increased sales by 2% in Asia. In 2010, as compared to 2009, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 12% and sales to industrial, food safety and environmental customers increased 14%. These increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems, chemistry consumables and services by the Companys customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to the prior year. Combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 and were primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced LC and LC MS systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in Asia. In 2009, as compared to 2008, sales to pharmaceutical customers decreased 4% and sales to industrial and environmental customers decreased 11%. These decreases were primarily a result of reduced spending on instrument systems caused by the global economic recession and, to a lesser extent, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in developing economies, including India, South America and Eastern Europe. Combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5% higher in 2009 and the increase was primarily attributed to sales of newly introduced MS instrument systems, higher ACQUITY UPLC instrument system sales and global governmental stimulus spending programs. Operating income was $450 million, $395 million and $390 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The overall increase in operating income in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily from the increases in sales volumes with relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages and benefits from lower spending earlier in 2010. Foreign currency translation had minimal comparative impact on operating income. The increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 was attributed to benefits of foreign currency translation and sales mix combined with lower spending. These increases were partially offset by the impact of $6 million of expense in connection with the TA building lease termination payment and $3 million of severance costs related to a restructuring in Europe. Net income per diluted share was $4.06, $3.34 and $3.21 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2010, 2009 and 2008: The benefits from higher sales volumes and the benefits from a shift in pretax income to lower tax rate jurisdictions increased net income per diluted share in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2008. In 2010, an $8 million tax benefit was recorded related to the reversal for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and a $2 million tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits added $0.10 per diluted share to 2010. 20 Table of Contents The $6 million TA building lease termination expense recorded in 2009 increased selling and administrative expenses and lowered net income per diluted share by $0.04 in 2009. A $5 million tax benefit was recorded in 2009 related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities and added $0.05 per diluted share to 2009. The impact of the 2008 out of period adjustments related to capitalized software amortization increased 2008 net income per diluted share by $0.08. Lower weighted average shares and equivalents, as a result of the Companys share buyback program, increased net income per diluted share in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2009 as compared to 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million, $418 million and $418 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $40 million increase in the operating cash flow in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily a result of higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments made in 2010 as compared to 2009 and a $6 million litigation payment and $6 million TA building lease termination payment made in 2009, as well as timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. The 2009 cash provided by operating activities was consistent with the 2008 cash provided by operating activities despite the lower sales volume and global economic recession. Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $63 million, $94 million and $69 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility, which was completed in June 2009. In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (subject to local regulatory approval) to purchase land in the United Kingdom to construct a new facility, which will consolidate certain existing primary manufacturing locations. The Company spent $3 million in 2010 in relation to this new facility and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $70 million to $90 million to construct this facility. The Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc. (Thar) for $36 million in cash in February 2009. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $101 million, $19 million and $29 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributed to changes in the Companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased $292 million, $210 million and $235 million of the Companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In March 2010, the Company issued and sold ten year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2020. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. As a result of these debt issuances, the Companys weighted average interest rates have increased in 2010 due to higher rates paid on this fixed rate debt. The Companys 2007 Credit Agreement expires in January 2012. The total outstanding debt balance of the 2007 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2010 is $555 million. The Company anticipates refinancing this credit agreement at current market interest rates and terms customary to investment grade borrowers. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net Sales Product sales were $1,167 million and $1,052 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in product sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher demand by the Companys customers as a result of improved economic conditions and an increase in sales from the recently introduced ACQUITY UPLC H Class, SYNAPT G 2 and Xevo Q Tof instrument systems. Service sales were $477 million and $447 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 7%. The increase in service sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division Net Sales Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology based) increased 11% in 2010 and were primarily attributable to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical, industrial, academic and government customers due to improvement in global economic conditions and the introduction of the new ACQUITY UPLC H Class, SYNAPT G 2 and Xevo Q Tof instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 9% in 2010 and were driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, specifically, the ACQUITY UPLC columns. Waters Division service sales increased 6% in 2010 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division sales by product line in both 2010 and 2009 were 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service. Waters Division sales in Europe decreased 1% in 2010 and the effects of foreign currency translation decreased European sales by 3% in 2010. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 19% in 2010, primarily due to strong sales growth in China and India. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales in Asia by 4% in 2010. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world increased 8% and 13%, respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation increased 2010 sales in the rest of world by 3%. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales were 17% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from TAs industrial customers due to improved economic conditions. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on TAs 2010 sales as compared to 2009. Instrument system sales increased 19% in 2010 and represented 75% of sales in 2010 as compared to 74% in 2009. TA service sales increased 11% in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales increased in each territory. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2010 was $990 million compared to $904 million for 2009, an increase of 10%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 60.2% in 2010 as compared to 60.3% in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars in 2010 was primarily attributed to higher sales volumes. During 2010, as compared to 2009, the Companys gross profit as a percentage of sales was slightly impacted by an unfavorable change in the sales mix and the unfavorable impact of movements in certain foreign exchange rates between the currencies where the Company manufactures products and the currencies where the sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. These declines in gross profit as a percentage of sales were mostly offset by the benefit of manufacturing product cost reductions and the benefit from manufacturing overhead absorption as a result of the increase in sales volume. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009 were $445 million and $421 million, respectively, an increase of 6%. The increase in 2010 selling and administrative expenses includes merit, merit related fringe benefit and incentive compensation increases. These increases were offset by the impact of the $6 million TA building lease 22 Table of Contents termination expense recorded in 2009 and an immaterial correction for certain incentive plan and other accrual balances recorded in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2010 compared to 28.1% for 2009. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $84 million and $77 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 9%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was primarily due to costs incurred on new products launched in 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 12.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. Included in the income tax provision for 2009 was a $5 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a $5 million provision that was originally recorded in 2008, relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. This tax benefit decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The remaining difference between the effective tax rates for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to higher pre tax income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. As a result of variability in these factors, the Companys effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates reported for 2010 or 2009. A known factor that will increase the Companys effective tax rate in the future is that the Companys Ireland statutory tax rate will increase to 12.5% in 2011 from the historical contractual tax rate of 10%. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Sales Product sales were $1,052 million and $1,140 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in product sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the overall decline in Waters and TA instrument system sales due to lower spending by the Companys customers as a result of the global economic recession and adverse effects from foreign currency translation. Service sales were $447 million and $435 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, an increase of 3%. The increase in service sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division Net Sales Waters Division sales declined 4% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in a decline in total sales of 2% in 2009. The 2009 acquisition of Thar and 2008 acquisition of Analytical Products Group, Inc. (APG) added 2% to sales in 2009. Chemistry consumables sales in 2009 were comparable to 2008, with the effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacting chemistry consumable sales by 2%. Waters Division service sales grew 3% in 2009 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The service sales growth rate was negatively impacted by 1% from the effect of foreign currency translation. Waters instrument system sales declined by 9% in 2009. The decrease in instrument system sales was primarily attributable to weak industrial and pharmaceutical customer spending caused by the global recession. The effect of foreign currency translation negatively impacted 2009 instrument system sales by 2%. Waters Division sales by product line in 2009 were 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service, as compared to 55% for instrument systems, 17% for chemistry consumables and 28% for service in 2008. 23 Table of Contents Waters Division sales in Europe declined 9% in 2009, primarily due to weak demand in Eastern Europe and the effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased 2009 sales in Europe by 6%. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 2% in 2009, with strong sales growth in China partially offset by weakness in other Asian markets. The effects of foreign currency translation increased Asias 2009 sales by 2%. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world declined 2% and 13%, respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation decreased 2009 sales in the rest of world by 3%. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales were 11% lower in 2009 as compared to the 2008 primarily as a result of weak instrument system demand from its industrial customers. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on TAs 2009 sales as compared to 2008. The 2008 acquisition of VTI added 1% to sales in 2009. Instrument system sales declined 15% in 2009 and represented 74% of sales in 2009 as compared to 78% in 2008. TA service sales increased 4% in 2009 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales decreased in each territory. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2009 was $904 million compared to $914 million for 2008, a decrease of 1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 60.3% in 2009 as compared to 58.0% in 2008. The decrease in gross profit dollars in 2009 was primarily attributed to lower sales volume and lower prices in certain geographies offset by benefits from net favorable foreign currency translation, a favorable change in sales mix and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit in 2008 also had a $9 million charge from out of period adjustments related to capitalized software amortization. During 2009, as compared to 2008, the Companys gross profit as a percentage of sales benefited from favorable movements in certain foreign exchange rates between currencies where the Company manufactures and services products and currencies where the sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was also primarily impacted by the change in sales mix, with 2009 including a higher level of higher margin chemistry consumables and service sales than 2008. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2009 and 2008 were $421 million and $427 million, respectively, a decrease of 1%. The decrease in 2009 selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to tighter control of discretionary spending, including no merit increase in 2009, lower incentive compensation and the comparative favorable impact of foreign currency translation. The 2009 decreases were offset by the impact of the $6 million expense incurred in connection with the TA lease termination payment. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 28.1% for 2009 compared to 27.1% for 2008. This increase can be attributed to lower 2009 sales volumes. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $77 million and $82 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease of 5%. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2009 was primarily due to the comparative favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Interest Expense Interest expense was $11 million and $39 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in 2009 was primarily attributable to a decrease in average borrowings, as well as significantly lower interest rates during 2009 as compared to 2008. Interest Income Interest income was $3 million and $21 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to significantly lower yields during 2009 as compared to 2008, as well as lower average cash and short term investment balances. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 16.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for 2009 was a $5 million tax benefit relating to the reversal of a $5 million provision that was 24 Table of Contents originally recorded in 2008, related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. The tax benefit in 2009 decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The one time tax provision in 2008 increased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in 2008. In addition, the effective tax rate for 2008 included a $16 million benefit resulting from out of period adjustments related to software capitalization amortization. The out of period adjustments had the effect of reducing the Companys effective tax rate by 4.0 percentage points in 2008. The remaining difference between the effective tax rates for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to differences in pre tax income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income $ 381,763 $ 323,313 $ 322,479 Depreciation and amortization 62,558 57,272 65,271 Stock based compensation 24,852 28,255 30,782 Deferred income taxes (15,037 ) 36,276 (19,626 ) Change in accounts receivable (43,286 ) (16,905 ) 21,739 Change in inventories (37,036 ) (6,823 ) (20,618 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities 52,017 (10,830 ) (19,970 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 9,433 2,613 1,976 Other changes 22,592 5,092 36,215 Net cash provided by operating activities 457,856 418,263 418,248 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (411,515 ) (419,028 ) 18,811 Net cash used in financing activities (60,252 ) (90,280 ) (572,938 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (18,702 ) 3,634 (32,932 ) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (32,613 ) $ (87,411 ) $ (168,811 ) Cash Flow from Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million and $418 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes in 2010 as compared to 2009. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 67 days at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The 2010 change in inventories was attributed to the increase in inventory related to the ramp up in sales of new products launched in the second half of 2010 and to be launched in early 2011. The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by a higher accounts payable balance, higher incentive compensation accruals and higher accrued interest balances, while the 2009 change was impacted by a $6 million litigation payment and a $6 million TA building lease termination payment. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of timing of payments to vendors. 25 Table of Contents Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2010 and 2009 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities was $418 million in both 2009 and 2008. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 as compared to 2008 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and the lower sales volumes in 2009 as compared to 2008. DSO increased to 67 days at December 31, 2009 from 63 days at December 31, 2008. The change in inventories in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily attributable to the decrease in sales volume. The 2009 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities includes a $6 million litigation payment, which was accrued in 2008. In 2009, the Company also made a $6 million payment to terminate the lease on the old TA facility. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of timing of payments to vendors and lower incentive compensation accruals. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2009 and 2008 was a result of the installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $412 million and $419 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $19 million in 2008. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $63 million, $94 million and $69 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital spending was higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility, which was completed in 2009. In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase land (subject to local regulatory approval) in the United Kingdom to construct a new facility, which will consolidate certain existing primary manufacturing locations. The Company spent $3 million in 2010 in relation to this new facility and expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $70 million to $90 million to construct this facility. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company purchased $1,235 million, $518 million and $20 million of short term investments, respectively, while $886 million, $229 million and $115 million of short term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $36 million and $8 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2010. Cash Used in Financing Activities In February 2010, the Company issued and sold five year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 3.75% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2015. In March 2010, the Company issued and sold ten year senior unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.00% with a face value of $100 million. This debt matures in February 2020. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of senior unsecured notes is payable semi annually in February and August of each year. The Company may redeem some of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make whole amount. These notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal 26 Table of Contents quarters, respectively. In addition, these notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. In March 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 2008 Credit Agreement) that provided for a $150 million term loan facility. In October 2008, the Company utilized cash balances associated with the effective liquidation of certain foreign legal entities into the U.S. to voluntarily prepay the $150 million term loan under the 2008 Credit Agreement. The repayment of the term loan effectively terminated all lending arrangements under the 2008 Credit Agreement. In January 2007, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 2007 Credit Agreement) that provides for a $500 million term loan facility and $600 million in revolving facilities, which include both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. The 2007 Credit Agreement matures on January 11, 2012 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. During 2010 and 2009, the Companys net debt borrowings increased by $134 million and $92 million, respectively. During 2008, the Companys net debt borrowings decreased $348 million. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $200 million in outstanding notes, $500 million borrowed under a term loan facility, $55 million borrowed under revolving credit facilities and $11 million borrowed under various other short term lines of credit. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Companys intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under existing credit agreements of $543 million after outstanding letters of credit. In 2011, the Company anticipates refinancing its 2007 Credit Agreement, which expires in January 2012, at market interest rates and terms customary to investment grade borrowers, but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so on such terms. The total outstanding debt balance of the 2007 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2010 is $555 million and, in January 2011, the outstanding $500 million borrowed under the term loan facility will become a current liability. In February 2009, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had purchased an aggregate of 7.5 million shares at a cost of $449 million under the February 2009 program, leaving $51 million authorized for future repurchases. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased 4.4 million, 4.5 million and 4.1 million shares at a cost of $292 million, $210 million and $235 million, respectively, under the February 2009 authorization and previously announced programs. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. The Company received $101 million, $19 million and $29 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company believes that the cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $946 million as of December 31, 2010 and expected cash flow from operating activities, together with borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities, will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending 27 Table of Contents requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends and the ability to raise funds from external sources, will be sufficient to meet future operating and investing needs for the foreseeable future. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year(1) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Notes payable and debt $ 66,055 $ 66,055 $ $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 700,000 500,000 100,000 100,000 Operating leases 74,991 23,881 18,169 12,033 7,594 5,063 4,237 4,014 Total $ 841,046 $ 89,936 $ 518,169 $ 12,033 $ 7,594 $ 105,063 $ 4,237 $ 104,014 (1) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business. The interest rates applicable to the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case plus a credit margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 33 basis points and 72.5 basis points for LIBOR rate loans and range between zero basis points and 37.5 basis points for base rate loans. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants that are customary for investment grade credit facilities and customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The following is a summary of the Companys known commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Letters of credit $ 1,537 $ 1,537 $ $ $ $ $ $ The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties, which expire at various dates through 2011. Fees paid for licenses were less than $1 million in each of the years 2010, 2009 and 2008. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2010 are immaterial. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. Current litigation is described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2011, the Company expects to contribute approximately $3 million to $5 million to the Companys defined benefit plans. In order to accommodate future sales growth, the Company has been authorized by the Board of Directors to develop and implement a plan to consolidate certain primary manufacturing locations in the United Kingdom into one facility. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $70 million to 28 Table of Contents $90 million to construct this facility. The Company believes it can fund the construction of this facility with cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $72 million in its income tax provision. The Companys uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2010, the Company does not expect to record any material changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the settlement of tax audit examinations or to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the next twelve months. The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Companys business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated 29 Table of Contents financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The Companys deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance and prior to shipment of the instrument. At December 31, 2010, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of $106 million and $18 million, respectively. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with multiple element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period. The amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. No revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The Companys software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when and if available basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is recognized as revenue. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may 30 Table of Contents result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2010 was $358 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $6 million. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2010 was $204 million, net of write downs to net realizable value of $15 million. Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant negative industry or economic trends; and, significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill amounted to $181 million, $215 million and $292 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting units, the Waters Division and TA. The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following: a significant decline in the Companys projected revenue, earnings or cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate; a significant decline in the Companys stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and, unanticipated competition. Warranty Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2010, the Companys warranty liability was $11 million. 31 Table of Contents Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. At December 31, 2010, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $72 million. Litigation As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in Item 3. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Companys results of operations or financial position. Pension and Other Retirement Benefits Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 6.86% for its U.S. benefit plans and 3.07% for its Non U.S. benefit plans. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer and Citigroup Pension Discount Curves for high quality investments and the Moodys Aa interest rate as of December 31, 2010 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2010, the Company determined the weighted average discount rate to be 5.31% for the U.S. benefit plans and 3.63% for the non U.S. benefits plans. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. 32 Table of Contents Stock based Compensation The accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the compensation expense that the Company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. As of December 31, 2010, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): Unrecognized Compensation Weighted Average Costs Life in Years Stock options $ 40 3.7 Restricted stock units 27 3.1 Restricted stock 1 1.8 Total $ 68 3.4 Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2009, a new accounting standard was issued relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This statement addresses (1) the effects on certain provisions of existing accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and (2) constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of existing accounting standards, including those in which the accounting and disclosures under existing accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2010, the Company adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. This standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. As this newly issued accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard did not impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, this standard will require additional disclosure and require an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in Level 3 fair value measurements on a gross basis, rather than as one net amount. 33 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. This consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards. This consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated. This guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon managements estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. Previously, the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Under the existing accounting consensus, if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Also in October 2009, a new accounting consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software. This consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance. This new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Hedge Transactions The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for 34 Table of Contents derivative instruments and hedging activities include the Companys objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Companys financial position and performance. The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Companys objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of $1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded additional interest expense of $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances and short term assets and liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound and Singapore Dollar. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $136 million, $138 million and $120 million, respectively. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had assets of less than $1 million in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had liabilities of $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively, in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange contracts.

The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, and AAA rated U.S. treasury and European government bond money market 35 Table of Contents funds. Investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments, and are held primarily in bank deposits and U.S., German, French and Dutch government treasury bills. Cash equivalents and short term investments are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant risk of change in market value. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no holdings in auction rate securities or commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation conduits or asset backed conduits. The Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value. 36 Table of Contents
