Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business and Financial Overview The Company has two operating segments: the Waters Division and the TA Division (TA&reg;). The Waters Divisions products and services primarily consist of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC&reg; and together with HPLC, referred to as LC), mass spectrometry (MS) and chemistry consumable products and related services. TA products and services primarily consist of thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instrument systems and service sales. The Companys products are used by pharmaceutical, life science, biochemical, industrial, food, environmental, academic and governmental customers. These customers use the Companys products to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials and to predict the suitability of fine chemicals, polymers and viscous liquids in consumer goods and healthcare products. The Companys sales were $1,851 million, $1,643 million and $1,499 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales increased 13% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 10% in 2010 as compared to 2009. In 2011, as compared with 2010, instrument system sales increased 14% while combined sales of chemistry consumables and services increased 11%. These overall increases in 2011 sales were attributable to increased spending by the Companys pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers on new and existing LC, MS and TA products. The sales growth in 2011 is also attributable to an increase in demand for the recently launched ACQUITY UPLC&reg; H Class, Xevo&reg; Q TofTM, Xevo&reg; TQ S and SYNAPT&reg; G2 S instrument systems. Sales growth of these new instrument systems was achieved in all major regions of the world. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales by 3% in 2011. The Company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be slightly negative to 2012 sales when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates. The 2010 increase in sales when compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher demand for the Companys products and services resulting from an improvement in global economic conditions, introduction of new 18 products, and an increase in pharmaceutical and industrial spending on the Companys products. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales growth in 2010. Waters Division sales increased 12% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The effect of foreign currency translation increased Waters Division sales by 3% in 2011 and had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010. TAs sales increased 16% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 17% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The effect of foreign currency translation increased TA sales by 3% in 2011 and had minimal impact on TA sales in 2010. The July 2011 acquisition of Anter Corporation (Anter) added 1% to TAs sales in 2011 when compared to 2010. Geographically, sales increased 16% in Europe, 13% in Asia (including Japan), 6% in the U.S. and 26% in the rest of the world during 2011 as compared with 2010. The effect of foreign currency translation increased sales in 2011 by 5% in Europe, 4% in Asia and 1% in the rest of the world. During 2010, as compared with 2009, sales increased 21% in Asia and 9% in the U.S., while sales were flat in Europe and increased 13% in the rest of the world. The effect of foreign currency translation decreased sales in 2010 by 4% in Europe and increased sales by 4% in Asia and 3% in the rest of the world. Europes 2011 sales benefited from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers. Asias 2011 sales growth rate was not as high as the 2010 sales growth rate due to the impact of large regulatory pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in China in late 2010 and a slowdown in customer orders in India in late 2011, principally due to the devaluation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. The Company does not expect the impact of the India rupee devaluation to have a long term effect on sales. In 2011, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 13% and combined sales to industrial and environmental customers increased 15% as compared to 2010. These increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems, chemistry consumables and services by the Companys customers and sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H Class, Xevo Q Tof, Xevo TQ S and SYNAPT G2 S instrument systems. In 2010, as compared to 2009, sales to pharmaceutical customers increased 12% and sales to industrial, food safety and environmental customers increased 14%. These increases were primarily a result of increased spending on instrument systems, chemistry consumables and services by the Companys customers as global economic conditions improved as compared to the prior year. Combined global sales to government and academic customers were 5% higher in both 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010 as compared to 2009. These increases were primarily attributable to sales of newly introduced LC and LC MS systems and strong global academic spending that occurred in Asia in 2010. In 2012, as a result of the continuing austerity programs being put in place worldwide, the Companys sales to governmental and academic customers may continue to lag behind the Companys overall anticipated sales growth rate. Operating income was $529 million, $450 million and $395 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The overall increase in operating income in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily due to increases in sales volumes and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The overall increase in operating income in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily from increases in sales volumes with relatively similar product mix and gross margin percentages. Foreign currency translation accounted for approximately $26 million and $6 million of the increases in operating income in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2010 compared to 2009, respectively. The Company expects the impact of foreign currency translation to be neutral or possibly decrease 2012 operating income when compared to 2011 based on current exchange rates. Net income per diluted share was $4.69, $4.06 and $3.34 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net income per diluted share was primarily impacted by the following factors in 2011, 2010 and 2009: The benefits from higher sales volumes, product mix and the leveraging of lower growth in operating expenses. The impact from the shift in pretax income between tax rate jurisdictions were negligible to the net income per diluted share in 2011 and increased net income per diluted share by $0.14 in 2010 after excluding the one time transactions noted below. 19 Foreign currency translation added $0.24 and $0.06 to net income per diluted share in 2011 and 2010, respectively. This benefit to net income per diluted share is not expected to continue in 2012 as compared to 2011 at current exchange rates. In 2010, an $8 million tax benefit was recorded related to the reversal for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and a $2 million tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits added $0.10 per diluted share in 2010. A $6 million TA building lease termination expense recorded in 2009 increased selling and administrative expenses and lowered net income per diluted share by $0.04 in 2009. A $5 million tax benefit was recorded in 2009 related to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities and added $0.05 per diluted share in 2009. The impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the Companys share repurchase program, offset by the incremental interest expense on borrowings to repurchase those shares, increased net income per diluted share slightly in 2011 and increased net income per diluted share by $0.06 in 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million, $458 million and $418 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The $39 million increase in operating cash flow in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily the result of higher net income and was also impacted in 2011 by the payment of amounts earned under the Companys 2010 management incentive plans. The increase in operating cash flow in 2010 when compared to 2009 was primarily a result of higher net income, lower incentive compensation payments made in 2010 as compared to 2009, and payments made in 2009 for a $6 million litigation payment and $6 million TA building lease termination. Within cash flows used in investing activities, capital expenditures related to property, plant, equipment and software capitalization were $85 million, $63 million and $94 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2011 due to a $14 million land acquisition in the United Kingdom, where the Company plans to construct a new facility that will consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to construct this facility. Capital expenditures were higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility. In January 2012, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Bahr Thermoanalyse GmbH (Bahr), a German manufacturer of a wide range of thermal analyzers, for $12 million in cash. The Company acquired the net assets of Anter for $11 million in cash in 2011. The Company acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of Thar Instruments, Inc. (Thar) for $36 million in cash in 2009. The Company continues to evaluate the acquisition of businesses, product lines and technologies to augment the Waters and TA operating divisions. Within cash flows used in financing activities, the Company received $60 million, $101 million and $19 million of proceeds from stock plans in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts were primarily attributable to changes in the Companys stock price and the expiration of stock option grants. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased $364 million, $292 million and $210 million of the Companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under the February 2011 authorization and previously announced stock repurchase programs. The Company believes that it has the financial flexibility to fund these share repurchases given current cash and debt levels, as well as to invest in research, technology and business acquisitions to further grow the Companys sales and profits. In July 2011, Waters entered into a new credit agreement (the 2011 Credit Agreement). The 2011 Credit Agreement provides for a $700 million revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. The term loan 20 facility and the revolving facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. In March 2011, the Company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with a total face value of $200 million. The Company used the proceeds from the 2011 Credit Agreement and the issuances of senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. As a result of the issuances of senior unsecured notes, the Companys weighted average interest rates have increased in 2011 due to higher rates paid on this fixed rate debt. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net Sales Product sales were $1,322 million and $1,167 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 13%. The increase in product sales in 2011 was primarily due to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical, industrial and chemical analysis customers and strong uptake in sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H Class, Xevo Q Tof, Xevo TQ S, SYNAPT G2 S, thermal analysis and rheology instrument systems. The Company also benefited during 2011 from higher sales of ACQUITY UPLC columns, which are primarily used by an expanding installed base of ACQUITY UPLC instruments. In addition, foreign currency translation added 3% to product sales for 2011. Service sales were $529 million and $477 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in service sales in 2011 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. In addition, foreign currency translation added 3% to service sales for 2011. Waters Division Net Sales Waters Division sales increased 12% in 2011 as compared to 2010. The effect of foreign currency translation benefited the Waters Division across all product lines, resulting in an increase in total sales of 3% in 2011. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS) increased 14% in 2011. The increase in instrument systems sales was primarily attributable to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical and industrial customers and the adoption and uptake in sales from the ACQUITY UPLC H Class, Xevo Q Tof and Xevo TQ S instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 11% in 2011. These increases were driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, including increased sales of ACQUITY UPLC lines of columns. Waters Division service sales grew 11% in 2011 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division sales by product line in 2011 were 53% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 29% for service, as compared to 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service in 2010. Waters Division sales in Europe increased 16%, with the effect of foreign currency translation increasing Europes sales by 5%. Waters Division sales in Europe benefited from strong demand from pharmaceutical and chemical analysis customers. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 13%; however, the sales growth rate was not as high as in 2010 due to the impact of large regulatory pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in China in late 2010 and a slowdown in customer orders in India in late 2011 due to the devaluation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. The effects of foreign currency translation increased Asias sales by 4%. Waters Division sales in the U.S. increased 5% and sales to the rest of the world increased 25%. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the rest of world. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales were 16% higher in 2011 as compared to 2010. Instrument system sales increased 17% in 2011 and represented 76% of sales in 2011 as compared to 75% in 2010. The increase in instrument system sales was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from TAs industrial customers due to improved economic conditions, as well as revenue associated with the shipment of the new Discovery instrument systems. 21 TA service sales increased 14% in 2011 due to sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. The effect of foreign currency translation added 3% to TAs 2011 sales as compared to 2010 and the 2011 acquisition of Anter added 1% to sales in 2011. Geographically, TAs sales increased in each territory. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2011 was $1,121 million compared to $990 million for 2010, an increase of 13%. The increase in gross profit dollars in 2011 was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 60.5% in 2011 as compared to 60.2% in 2010 due to sales volume leveraging manufacturing fixed costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit as a percentage of sales is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, product mix and product costs of instrument systems and associated software platforms. Beginning in 2012, the Company expects to introduce several new products and software platforms whose cost and amortization of capitalized software development costs may affect the Companys product mix and may lower associated gross profit margins slightly as a percentage of sales. See Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for estimated future amortization expense. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2011 and 2010 were $490 million and $445 million, respectively, an increase of 10%. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2011 was a result of the Companys investment in headcount additions, principally in sales and service; higher merit and fringe benefit costs; higher sales and incentive compensation costs; and foreign currency translation. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 26.5% for 2011 compared to 27.1% for 2010. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $92 million and $84 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 10%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2011 was primarily due to development costs incurred on new products and increased headcount. Interest Expense Interest expense was $22 million and $14 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2011 was primarily attributable to an increase in average borrowings, as well as higher interest rates paid on fixed rate debt. Provision for Income Taxes The four principal jurisdictions the Company manufactures in are the U.S., Ireland, the United Kingdom and Singapore, where the effective tax rates are approximately 35%, 12.5%, 26.5% and 0%. The Company has a contractual tax rate in Singapore of 0% through the end of 2016, while the statutory tax rate in Singapore is 17%. The Companys effective tax rate is influenced by many significant factors, including, but not limited to, the wide range of income tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates; sales volumes and profit levels in each tax jurisdiction; changes in tax laws, tax rates and policies; and the impact of foreign currency transactions and translation. As a result of variability in these factors, the Companys effective tax rates in the future may not be similar to the effective tax rates reported for 2011, 2010 or 2009. The Companys effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 15.0% and 12.8%, respectively. Included in the income tax provision for 2011 is a $2 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a reserve for interest related to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom. This tax benefit decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 0.3 percentage points in 2011. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the 22 Companys effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. The remaining difference between the effective tax rate for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a slight shift in pre tax income recognized in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net Sales Product sales were $1,167 million and $1,052 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 11%. The increase in product sales in 2010 was primarily due to higher demand by the Companys customers as a result of improved economic conditions and an increase in sales from the recently introduced ACQUITY UPLC H Class, SYNAPT G 2 and Xevo Q Tof instrument systems. Service sales were $477 million and $447 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 7%. The increase in service sales in 2010 was primarily attributable to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division Net Sales Waters Division sales increased 9% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on Waters Division sales in 2010. Waters instrument system sales (LC and MS technology based) increased 11% in 2010 and were primarily attributable to higher demand from the Companys pharmaceutical, industrial, academic and government customers due to improvement in global economic conditions and the introduction of the new ACQUITY UPLC H Class, SYNAPT G 2 and Xevo Q Tof instrument systems. Chemistry consumables sales increased 9% in 2010 and were driven primarily by higher demand for chemistry consumable products, specifically, the ACQUITY UPLC columns. Waters Division service sales increased 6% in 2010 due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Waters Division sales by product line in both 2010 and 2009 were 52% for instrument systems, 18% for chemistry consumables and 30% for service. Waters Division sales in Europe decreased 1% in 2010 and the effects of foreign currency translation decreased European sales by 3% in 2010. Waters Division sales in Asia increased 19% in 2010, primarily due to strong sales growth in China and India. The effects of foreign currency translation increased sales in Asia by 4% in 2010. Waters Division sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world increased 8% and 13%, respectively. The effects of foreign currency translation increased 2010 sales in the rest of world by 3%. TA Division Net Sales TAs sales were 17% higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily a result of higher demand for instrument systems from TAs industrial customers due to improved economic conditions. Foreign currency translation had minimal impact on TAs 2010 sales as compared to 2009. Instrument system sales increased 19% in 2010 and represented 75% of sales in 2010 as compared to 74% in 2009. TA service sales increased 11% in 2010 primarily due to increased sales of service plans and billings to a higher installed base of customers. Geographically, sales increased in each territory. Gross Profit Gross profit for 2010 was $990 million compared to $904 million for 2009, an increase of 10%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 60.2% in 2010 as compared to 60.3% in 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars in 2010 was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes. During 2010, the Companys gross profit as a percentage of sales was slightly impacted by an unfavorable change in the sales mix and the unfavorable impact of movements in certain foreign exchange rates between the currencies where the Company manufactures products and the currencies where the sales were transacted, principally the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. These declines in gross profit as a percentage of sales were mostly offset by the benefit of manufacturing product cost reductions and the benefit from manufacturing overhead absorption as a result of the increase in sales volume. 23 Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses for 2010 and 2009 were $445 million and $421 million, respectively, an increase of 6%. The increase in 2010 selling and administrative expenses includes merit, merit related fringe benefit and incentive compensation increases. These increases were offset by the impact of the $6 million TA building lease termination expense recorded in 2009 and an immaterial correction for certain incentive plan and other accrual balances recorded in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 27.1% for 2010 compared to 28.1% for 2009. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $84 million and $77 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of 9%. The increase in research and development expenses in 2010 was primarily due to costs incurred on new products launched in 2010. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 12.8% and 16.4%, respectively. Included in the 2010 income tax provision was an $8 million tax benefit related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to an audit settlement in the United Kingdom and $2 million of tax benefit related to the resolution of a pre acquisition tax exposure. These tax benefits decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 2.1 percentage points in 2010. Included in the income tax provision for 2009 was a $5 million tax benefit related to the reversal of a $5 million provision that was originally recorded in 2008, relating to the reorganization of certain foreign legal entities. The recognition of this tax benefit in 2009 was a result of changes in income tax regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury in February 2009. This tax benefit decreased the Companys effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2009. The remaining difference between the effective tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to higher pre tax income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net income $ 432,968 $ 381,763 $ 323,313 Depreciation and amortization 66,387 62,558 57,272 Stock based compensation 27,579 24,852 28,255 Deferred income taxes (5,824 ) (15,037 ) 36,276 Change in accounts receivable (12,528 ) (43,286 ) (16,905 ) Change in inventories (18,838 ) (37,036 ) (6,823 ) Change in accounts payable and other current liabilities (11,845 ) 52,017 (10,830 ) Change in deferred revenue and customer advances 2,630 9,433 2,613 Other changes 16,845 22,592 5,092 Net cash provided by operating activities 497,374 457,856 418,263 Net cash used in investing activities (355,976 ) (411,515 ) (419,028 ) Net cash used in financing activities (60,422 ) (60,252 ) (90,280 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5,484 ) (18,702 ) 3,634 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 75,492 $ (32,613 ) $ (87,411 ) 24 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities was $497 million and $458 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 when compared to 2010 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes in 2011 as compared to 2010. Days sales outstanding (DSO) was 64 days at December 31, 2011 and 67 days at December 31, 2010. The 2011 change in inventories was attributable to the increase in inventory related to the introduction of new products and associated spare parts launched in 2011. The 2011 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in income taxes payable in the current year as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was a result of increases in accounts payable and accrued income taxes. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2011 and 2010 was a result of the higher installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities was $458 million and $418 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The changes within net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 include the following significant changes in the sources and uses of net cash provided by operating activities, aside from the increase in net income: The change in accounts receivable in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to timing of payments made by customers and higher sales volumes in 2010 as compared to 2009. DSO was 67 days at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. The 2010 change in inventories was attributed to the increase in inventory related to the ramp up in sales of new products launched in the second half of 2010 and in early 2011. The 2010 change in accounts payable and other current liabilities was impacted by a higher accounts payable balance, higher incentive compensation accruals and higher accrued interest balances, while the 2009 change was impacted by a $6 million litigation payment and a $6 million TA building lease termination payment. In addition, accounts payable and other current liabilities changed as a result of timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided from deferred revenue and customer advances in both 2010 and 2009 was a result of the higher installed base of customers renewing annual service contracts. Other changes were attributable to variation in the timing of various provisions, expenditures and accruals in other current assets, other assets and other liabilities. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $356 million, $412 million and $419 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Additions to fixed assets and capitalized software were $85 million, $63 million and $94 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures were higher in 2011 due to a $14 million land 25 acquisition in the United Kingdom, where the Company plans to construct a new facility that will consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to construct this facility. Capital expenditures were higher in 2009 due to the acquisition of land and construction of a new TA facility. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company purchased $1,749 million, $1,235 million and $518 million of short term investments, respectively, while $1,490 million, $886 million and $229 million of short term investments matured, respectively. Business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, were $11 million and $36 million during 2011 and 2009, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2010. Cash Used in Financing Activities In July 2011, Waters entered into the 2011 Credit Agreement, which provides for a $700 million revolving facility and a $300 million term loan facility. The term loan facility and the revolving facility both mature on July 28, 2016 and require no scheduled prepayments before that date. The Company uses the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. In July 2011, the Company borrowed $300 million under the new term loan facility. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement entered into in January 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement). Waters terminated the 2007 Credit Agreement early without penalty. The interest rates applicable to the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Companys intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. The Company issued and sold senior unsecured notes with a face value of $200 million in both 2011 and 2010. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes to repay other outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes. Interest on both issuances of senior unsecured notes is payable semi annually. The Company may redeem some of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make whole amount. These senior unsecured notes require that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.50:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, these senior unsecured notes include customary negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Companys net debt borrowings increased by $225 million, $134 million and $92 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total of $991 million in outstanding debt, which consisted of $400 million in outstanding notes, $300 million borrowed under a term loan facility under the 2011 Credit Agreement, $280 million borrowed under revolving credit facility under the 2011 Credit Agreement and $11 million borrowed under various other short term lines of credit. The outstanding portions of the revolving facilities have been classified as short term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets due to the 26 fact that the Company utilizes the revolving line of credit to fund its working capital needs. It is the Companys intention to pay the outstanding revolving line of credit balance during the subsequent twelve months following the respective period end date; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total amount available to borrow under existing credit agreements of $419 million after outstanding letters of credit. In February 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock over a two year period. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company repurchased 4.5 million, 4.4 million and 4.5 million shares at a cost of $364 million, $292 million and $210 million, respectively, under the February 2011 authorization and previously announced programs. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had purchased an aggregate of 3.8 million shares at a cost of $314 million under the February 2011 program, leaving $186 million authorized for future repurchases. The Company received $60 million, $101 million and $19 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. The majority of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are generated from foreign operations, with $1.2 billion held by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2011. Due to the fact that most of the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short term investments are held outside of the U.S., the Company must manage and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow in the U.S. to fund operations and capital expenditures, service debt and interest, finance potential U.S. acquisitions and continue to repurchase shares under the authorized stock repurchase program in the U.S. These U.S. cash requirements are managed by the Companys cash flow from U.S. operations and the use of the Companys revolving credit facilities. Management believes, as of the date of this report, that its financial position, along with expected future cash flows from earnings based on historical trends, the ability to raise funds from external sources and the borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities will be sufficient to service debt and fund working capital and capital spending requirements, authorized share repurchase amounts, potential acquisitions and any adverse final determination of ongoing litigation for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Companys known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year(1) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 After 2017 Notes payable and debt $ 290,832 $ 290,832 $ $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 700,000 100,000 350,000 250,000 Operating leases 74,996 23,829 18,407 13,332 7,036 5,410 3,725 3,257 Total $ 1,065,828 $ 314,661 $ 18,407 $ 13,332 $ 107,036 $ 355,410 $ 3,725 $ 253,257 (1) Does not include normal purchases made in the ordinary course of business and uncertain tax positions discussed below. The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans under the 2011 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 1/2%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1%) or the applicable 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage ratio, which can range between 0 to 20 basis points and between 85 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. The 27 facility fee on the 2011 Credit Agreement ranges between 15 basis points and 30 basis points. The 2011 Credit Agreement requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not less than 3.50:1 and a leverage ratio test of not more than 3.25:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, respectively. In addition, the 2011 Credit Agreement includes negative covenants, affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default that are customary for investment grade credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The following is a summary of the Companys known commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Amount of Commitments Expiration Per Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Letters of credit $ 17,649 $ 1,087 $ 341 $ 16,221 $ $ $ $ The Company licenses certain technology and software from third parties and the licenses expire at various dates through 2012. Fees paid for licenses were less than $1 million in each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009. Future minimum license fees payable under existing license agreements as of December 31, 2011 are immaterial. From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in its current litigation matters and believes any outcome, either individually or in the aggregate, will not be material to the Companys financial position or results of operations. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K. The Company has long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental executive retirement plans. The payments related to the supplemental retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the Company and whether the employee elects lump sum or annuity payments. During fiscal year 2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $7 million to $9 million to the Companys defined benefit plans. In order to accommodate future sales growth, the Company purchased land in the United Kingdom for $14 million in 2011 to consolidate certain existing primary MS research, manufacturing and distribution locations in the United Kingdom into one facility. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures in the next few years in the range of $50 million to $70 million to construct this facility. The Company believes it can fund the construction of this facility with cash flows from operating activities and its borrowing capacity from committed credit facilities. The Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. If all of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2011 were to become recognizable in the future, the Company would record a total reduction of approximately $73 million in its income tax provision. The Companys uncertain tax positions are taken with respect to income tax return reporting periods beginning after December 31, 1999, which are the periods that generally remain open to income tax audit examination by the concerned income tax authorities. The Company continuously monitors the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments for related changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does not expect to record any material changes in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, related net interest and penalties or deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the settlement of tax audit examinations within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2011, the Company does expect, however, to record a reduction in the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits and related net interest and penalties of approximately $4 million due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations on potential tax assessments within the next twelve months. 28 The Company has not paid any dividends and does not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not created, and is not party to, any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated (to the extent of the Companys ownership interest therein) into the consolidated financial statements. The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby it has subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company. The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Companys business partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to its current products, as well as claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by the Company or its subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the Companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Summary The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain and that would have a material impact on the Companys results of operations given changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There are other items within the Companys consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service, respectively. The Companys deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the obligation on instrument service contracts and customer payments received in advance and prior to shipment of the instrument. At December 31, 2011, the Company had current and long term deferred revenue liabilities of $110 million and $25 million, respectively. Revenue is recognized when all of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the vendors fee is fixed or determinable; collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash holdback are specified. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. Product shipments, including those for demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices. The 29 Company generally recognizes product revenue when legal title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company structures its sales arrangements as shipping point or international equivalent and, accordingly, recognizes revenue upon shipment. In some cases, destination based shipping terms are included in sales arrangements, in which cases revenue is generally recognized when the products arrive at the customer site. The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain products requiring installation is in accordance with multiple element revenue recognition accounting standards. With respect to the installation obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third parties. Instrument service contracts are typically billed at the beginning of the maintenance period. The amount of the service contract is amortized ratably to revenue over the instrument maintenance period. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. No revenue is recognized until all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for software revenue recognition. The Companys software arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts. Software license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, collection is probable, and there are no significant post delivery obligations remaining. The revenue associated with the software maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when and if available basis. The Company uses the residual method to allocate software revenue when a transaction includes multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered element (maintenance) is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element (software license) and is recognized as revenue. Loss Provisions on Accounts Receivable and Inventory The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not request collateral from its customers, but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit. The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, past transaction history with the customer, the credit worthiness of the customer, industry trends and the macro economic environment. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad debt losses. Sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts. The Companys accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2011 was $367 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of $9 million. The Company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in, first out basis (FIFO). The Company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence, historical demand, projections of future demand, including that in the Companys current backlog of orders, and industry and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write downs may be required. The Companys inventory balance at December 31, 2011 was recorded at its net realizable value of $213 million, which is net of write downs of $14 million. 30 Long Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, particularly as it pertains to capitalized software; significant negative industry or economic trends, competitive products and technologies; and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the Companys capitalized patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as licenses. When the Company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset, long lived asset or goodwill, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Net intangible assets, long lived assets and goodwill amounted to $192 million, $237 million and $297 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011. The Company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on January 1 of each year. For goodwill impairment review purposes, the Company has two reporting units, the Waters Division and TA Division. The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future; however, there can be no assurance that, at the time future reviews are completed, a material impairment charge will not be recorded. The factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include, but are not limited to, the following: significant decline in the Companys projected revenue, earnings or cash flows; significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate; significant decline in the Companys stock price or the stock price of comparable companies; adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. Warranty Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys previous estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31, 2011, the Companys warranty liability was $13 million. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves the Company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, amortization and inventory reserves, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. 31 The accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that the actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods. In addition, the Company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard, which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions, as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money. At December 31, 2011, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $73 million. Litigation As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K, the Company is a party to various pending litigation matters. With respect to each pending claim, management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and, if so, the probable range of that loss. If and when management has determined, with respect to a particular claim, both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss, the Company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss. The Company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation. With respect to the claims referenced in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of Part I of this Form 10 K, management of the Company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to certain claims. As developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available, management of the Company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range, which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the Companys results of operations or financial position. Pension and Other Retirement Benefits Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the Companys pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management. Changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data. Critical assumptions, such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, are evaluated and updated annually. The Company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.20% for its U.S. benefit plans and 2.50% for its non U.S. benefit plans. At the end of each year, the Company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. The Company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the Mercer Pension Discount Curve for high quality investments as of December 31, 2011 that best matched the timing of the plans future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Once the interest rates were determined, the plans cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date. At December 31, 2011, the Company determined the weighted average discount rate to be 4.33% for the U.S. benefit plans and 3.29% for the non U.S. benefits plans. A one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. A one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the Companys net periodic benefit cost for the Waters Retirement Plan by less than $1 million. Stock based Compensation The accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The Company has used the Black Scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this 32 statement, share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. As stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest, the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. This accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard, the compensation expense that the Company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and, consequently, has not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified transition method, compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to December 31, 2005 and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to December 31, 2005. The Company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method. As of December 31, 2011, unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows (in millions): UnrecognizedCompensationCosts Weighted AverageLife in Years Stock options $ 46 3.8 Restricted stock units 27 3.1 Restricted stock 1 1.7 Total $ 74 3.5 Recent Accounting Standard Changes and Developments Information regarding recent accounting standard changes and developments is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this document and should be considered an integral part of this Item 7. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments, for purposes other than trading, in accordance with the Companys overall risk management guidelines. The Company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances, forecasted transactions and cash flow, and net assets denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations. The Company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. The Companys policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and 33 floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate. At times, to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner, the Company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. Hedge Transactions The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. In addition, disclosures required for derivative instruments and hedging activities include the Companys objectives for using derivative instruments, the level of derivative activity the Company engages in, as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Companys financial position and performance. The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks. The Companys objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions. In addition, the Company considers the impact of its counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts. The Company also assesses and documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. Cash Flow Hedges The Company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding U.S. dollar floating rate debt. In August 2007, the Company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps, each with a notional amount of $50 million and maturity dates of April 2009 and October 2009, to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt. The Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a change of $2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements and recorded additional interest expense of $2 million. Other The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts, principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances and short term assets and liabilities. Principal hedged currencies include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts, which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $161 million, $136 million and $138 million, respectively. 34 The Companys foreign currency exchange contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Other current assets $ 81 $ 424 Other current liabilities $ 1,317 $ 626 The following is a summary of the activity in the statements of operations related to the forward foreign exchange contracts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Realized (losses) gains on closed contracts $ (2,233 ) $ (8,138 ) $ 5,162 Unrealized (losses) gains on open contracts (1,035 ) (39 ) 1,448 Cumulative net pre tax (losses) gains $ (3,268 ) $ (8,177 ) $ 6,610 Assuming a hypothetical adverse change of 10% in year end exchange rates (a strengthening of the U.S. dollar), the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011 would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately $16 million. The Company is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations from the investments of cash generated from operations. The Companys cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less, primarily in bank deposits, U.S. treasury bills, U.S. treasury bill money market funds, Canadian U.S. dollar denominated treasury bills, commercial paper and European government bond money market funds. Investments with longer maturities are classified as short term investments, and are held primarily in bank deposits, investment grade commercial paper and U.S., Canadian, German and Dutch government treasury bills. The Company maintains balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and in foreign subsidiary accounts in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $1,200 million out of $1,281 million and $901 million out of $946 million, respectively, of the Companys total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and may be subject to material tax repatriation effects.
