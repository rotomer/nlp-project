Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements The following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. You are urged to carefully review our description and examples of forward looking statements included earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10 K immediately prior to Part I, under the heading Forward Looking Statements. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements. You are urged to carefully review the disclosures we make concerning risks and other factors that may affect our business and operating results, including those made in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, as well as our other reports filed with the SEC. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We do not 30 Table of Contents intend, and undertake no obligation, to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Adjustment to Previously Issued Financial Statements We are filing this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended June 30, 2006 with adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004 and the related disclosures. This Form 10 K also includes adjustments to selected financial data as of and for the years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, which is included in Item 6. We have adjusted our consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004, as well as the selected financial data for the years ended June 27, 2003 and June 28, 2002, to record additional non cash stock based compensation expense, and related tax accruals, resulting from stock options granted during fiscal years 1998 to 2003 that were incorrectly accounted for under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our decision to adjust our financial statements was based on the facts obtained from an independent investigation into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of a special committee (Special Committee) of our Board of Directors. The Board created the Special Committee, which was composed solely of independent directors, to conduct a voluntary, company initiated review of matters related to past stock option grants, including the timing of such grants and associated documentation. The Special Committee reviewed all option grants of the Company during the period from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2006 (the Review Period). The Special Committee reviewed corporate records and electronic documentation and interviewed current and former employees and directors. The Special Committee presented its investigative findings and recommendations to the Board of Directors and our independent auditors, KPMG LLP. At the completion of its investigation, the Special Committee identified, and our management concurred, that the appropriate measurement date for 28 option grants made on 27 separate grant dates during the period from fiscal 1998 through fiscal 2004 differed from the originally stated grant dates for such awards. Because the prices at the originally stated grant dates were, in 19 of such instances, lower than the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants, our management determined we should have recognized stock based compensation expense and additional tax expense in our historical financial statements for these 19 grants. For the remaining 9 grants, since the prices at the originally stated grant dates were at or above the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants, we determined that no accounting adjustment should be made for these grants. Key findings from the Special Committees investigation include: Found no evidence that anyone manipulated the grant documentation or grant dates in order to avoid compensation expense or other financial statement impacts. Found no misconduct by any member of our current management team. For 19 grants made during the period from fiscal 1998 through fiscal 2003, our stock price at the appropriate measurement date was higher than the price on the originally stated grant dates. As a result, we should have recognized stock based compensation expense and additional tax expense in our historical financial statements for these 19 grants. Based on these findings, we have determined we should have recognized approximately $21 million of stock based compensation and tax related expenses. Approximately $13.2 million, before tax related expenses, of these additional expenses were attributable to annual employee stock option grants made by the Compensation Committee in November 1998 and 1999 and a special employee grant made in March 2000 for which there was inadequate or no support for selection of the grant dates, and the grant dates were at a low price in the relevant period. These grants were made by unanimous written consent of the Compensation Committee of our Board. The Special Committee concluded that the annual employee stock option grant made in November 1999 was intentionally dated with hindsight at a low price. While improper, no evidence was found that this action was taken to avoid compensation expense or other financial statement impacts. 31 Table of Contents Approximately $4.2 million, before tax related expenses, of these additional expenses were attributable to annual employee stock option grants made in September 2001 and 2002. For these grants, acting at a meeting, the Compensation Committee approved specific grants for Section 16(b) Officers and an overall budgeted number of shares for grants to employees that were not Section 16(b) Officers to be allocated by later management action. The allocation of awards to employees that were not Section 16(b) Officers was not completed with finality by the grant date. Approximately $1.0 million, before tax related expenses, additional expenses were attributable to grants involving a variety of administrative errors, including errors in administration of grants to new hires and in connection with promotions, and errors in supporting documentation. We determined that the cumulative pre tax non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates was approximately $18.4 million for fiscal years 1998 to 2006. This additional compensation expense relates to stock options covering approximately 12.6 million shares. Additionally, we have recorded $2.5 million in tax related expenses resulting from the recharacterization of incentive stock options to non qualified stock options for fiscal years 1998 to 2006. The following table summarizes the impact of the related adjustments (in millions): Years Ended June 30, July 1, July 2, Fiscal Years 2006 2005 2004 1998 to 2003 Total Stock based compensation expense $ 0.7 $ 1.0 $ 1.3 $ 15.4 $ 18.4 Tax related expenses 0.6 1.4 0.2 0.3 2.5 Total $ 1.3 $ 2.4 $ 1.5 $ 15.7 $ 20.9 The following table reflects the consolidated income statement classification of the additional stock based compensation and tax related expenses related to the adjustment for fiscal years 1998 to 2006: Cost of revenue $ 2.0 Research and development expense 12.2 Selling, general and administrative expense 6.1 Provision for income taxes 0.6 Total $ 20.9 The adjustments reduce previously reported diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) by $0.01 each for both of the years ended July 1, 2005 and July 2, 2004. Given that we have concluded that the foregoing adjustments were not material to our historical consolidated financial statements, we have not amended, and do not intend to amend, any of our previously filed annual reports on Form 10 K or quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the periods affected by the adjustments. For additional information on the adjustments, see Part II, Item 8 Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our Company We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks and allows fast access to data. Hard drives are key components of computers, data storage subsystems and many consumer electronics (CE) devices. We sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) for use in computer systems, subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers, notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers, workstations, network attached storage and storage area networks. Additionally, our hard drives are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders (DVR), satellite and cable set top boxes (STB), MP3 players, and universal serial bus (USB) thumb drives. We also sell our hard drives as stand alone storage products and integrate them into our own WD branded external storage products for uses such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music, photography, video, and other data. Hard drives provide non volatile data storage, which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5 inch, 2.5 inch and 1.0 inch form factor drives. The 3.5 inch 32 Table of Contents form factor drives have capacities ranging from 36 gigabytes (GB) to 500 GB, nominal rotation speeds of 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and offer interfaces including both Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA). The 2.5 inch form factor drives have capacities ranging from 40 GB to 160 GB, nominal rotation speed of 5,400 RPM, and offer both the EIDE and SATA interfaces. Our 1.0 inch form factor, with 4 and 6 GB hard drives, used primarily in miniature portable storage devices, have a nominal rotation speed of 3,600 RPM and use the CompactFlash 130 interface. We assemble hard drives in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads, head gimbal assemblies (HGA) and head stack assemblies (HSA) in Fremont, California and Bang Pa In, Thailand. For geographical financial data, see Part II, Item 8, Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Market Overview For calendar year 2005, we believe that the total market for hard drives was more than 380 million units, or almost $28 billion in sales. Over half of these unit shipments were to the desktop market. Total hard drive unit growth depends greatly on developments in the PC market. We believe that the demand for hard drives in the PC market has grown in part due to: the overall growth of PC sales; the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased storage capacity on their PCs; the continuing development of software applications to manage multimedia content; and the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content downloaded from the Internet onto PC hard drives. We believe several other factors affect the rate of PC unit growth, including maturing PC markets in North America and Western Europe, an increase in first time buyers of PCs in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, and the lengthening of PC replacement cycles. We entered the mobile market in the first quarter of 2005, commencing volume production of our WD Scorpiotm family of 2.5 inch hard drives for notebook computers. We expect the mobile market, which is primarily notebook computers, to continue to grow faster than the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years. We believe that the demand for mobile drives has grown from approximately 16% of the overall hard drive market in 2003 to 21% of the overall hard drive market in 2005. As the mobile market evolves to a higher volume market, we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on attributes such as quality, reliability, execution, flexibility, and competitive cost structures on their hard drive suppliers. These are the same attributes that have mattered for many years to customers in the high volume desktop market. The enterprise market for hard drives focuses on customers that make workstations, servers, network attached storage devices, storage area networks, and other computing systems or subsystems. We serve this market with hard drives using the SATA interface, which is similar in performance in some applications to the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI), but more cost effective than SCSI. We believe that the enterprise market has two distinct sectors: a marketplace for high performance enterprise hard drives and a marketplace for high capacity enterprise hard drives. We believe that acceptance of SATA in both of these enterprise market sectors is growing. Additionally, we offer high capacity, high reliability Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) enterprise products to service video surveillance and similar PATA based systems. Expansion of our involvement in the enterprise market may require us to make additional investments. The use of hard drives in CE products has been a major growth area in recent years. Todays three largest segments of this market are: (1) digital television content in applications such as DVRs; (2) audio content in applications such as consumer handheld devices, such as MP3 players; and (3) hard drives in game consoles. Since 1999, DVRs have been available for use in home entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such as pausing live television, simplifying the process of recording, cataloging recorded television programs and quickly forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television program. The market for DVR products favors large capacity hard drives and continues to grow in Japan, North America, and Europe. We believe growth in this market will continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives. Hard drives with 1.8 inch or 1.0 inch form factors primarily address the consumer handheld device 33 Table of Contents and portable external storage markets. The majority of hard drives used in portable media players that play both digital audio and video content are 1.8 inch form factors. The branded products market for hard drives features storage products that we sell directly to end customers through retail store fronts and online stores. Our branded products include external hard drives, which are internal drives embedded into WD branded PC peripheral style enclosures, which have FireWiretm, USB 2.0 and Ethernet network connections; and internal hard drives that are packaged as an installation kit with the WD brand for retail store sales. We believe the worldwide demand for external hard drives is growing, spurred by consumers and businesses expanding use of digital content in the form of photographs, video and music all of which consume large amounts of storage. Results of Operations Fiscal 2006 Overview In 2006, our net revenue increased by 19.3% to $4.3 billion on unit shipments of 73.3 million as compared to $3.6 billion and 61.4 million, respectively, in 2005. In 2006, 29% of our revenue was derived from non desktop sources including CE products, enterprise applications, notebook computers and retail sales as compared to 21% in 2005. Gross margin increased to 19.1% from 16.2% in 2005. Operating income increased by $171 million to $366 million. Operating income increased to 8.4% as a percentage of net revenue in 2006 compared with 5.3% in 2005. We generated $402 million in cash flow from operations in 2006 compared with $461 million in 2005, finishing the year with $699 million in cash and short term investments, an increase of $100 million from the prior year. We utilized $54 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock. Summary Comparison of 2006, 2005 and 2004 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, summary information from our consolidated statements of income (in millions except percentages): Years Ended June 30, 2006 July 1, 2005 July 2, 2004 (as adjusted) (as adjusted) Revenue, net $ 4,341 100.0 % $ 3,639 100.0 % $ 3,047 100.0 % Gross margin 829 19.1 590 16.2 462 15.1 Operating expenses 463 10.7 395 10.9 308 10.1 Operating income 366 8.4 195 5.3 154 5.0 Non operating income 16 0.4 5 0.2 0.0 Income before income taxes 382 8.8 200 5.5 154 5.0 Income tax (benefit) expense (13 ) (0.3 ) 4 0.1 4 0.1 Net income 395 9.1 196 5.4 150 4.9 34 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, summary information regarding volume shipments, average selling prices (ASP) and revenues by geography, channel and product (in millions except percentages and ASP): Years Ended June 30, July 1, July 2, 2006 2005 2004 Net revenue $ 4,341.3 $ 3,638.8 $ 3,046.7 Unit shipments 73.3 61.4 48.3 ASP (per unit) $ 59 $ 59 $ 63 Revenues by Geography (%) Americas 36 % 38 % 41 % Europe 28 29 30 Asia 36 33 29 Revenues by Channel (%) OEM 54 % 58 % 51 % Distributors 39 36 42 Branded products 7 6 7 Revenues by Product (%) Desktop computers 71 % 79 % 86 % Non desktop sources 29 21 14 Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $4.3 billion for 2006, an increase of 19.3% from 2005. Total unit shipments increased to 73.3 million as compared to 61.4 million for the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the non desktop market, including mobile, CE and branded products. For example, we shipped 5.4 million drives to the mobile market in 2006 as compared to 1.0 million units in 2005. Additionally, we shipped 6.7 million units to the DVR market in 2006 as compared to 3.6 million units in 2005. ASP remained at a relatively constant level of $59 due to an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold offset by moderate price declines. Revenue contribution by geographic region for 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects our continued focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets, primarily in Asia. Changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives. Gross Margin. Gross margin for 2006 was $829 million, an increase of $239 million, or 40.5% over the prior year. Gross margin percentage increased to 19.1% in 2006 from 16.2% in 2005. Gross margin was favorably impacted in 2006 by the following factors: 1) manufacturing efficiencies, 2) lower customer returns resulting from ongoing quality improvements that favorably impacted warranty obligations, and 3) an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold. Moderate price declines somewhat offset the favorable impact of the aforementioned factors. During 2006 and 2005, our warranty accrual for prior quarters shipments was favorably adjusted by approximately $30 million and $1 million, respectively, as a result of improvements in quality and customer return rates and their expected impact on future levels of customer returns under warranty. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, were 10.7% of net revenue in 2006, as compared to 10.9% of net revenue in 2005. R&D expense was $297 million in 2006, an increase of $57 million, or 23.8% over the prior year. The increase in R&D expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets, expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of $18 million in employee incentive compensation programs, of which $12 million related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 R. SG&A expense was $166 million in 2006, an increase of $11 million, or 7.1% as compared to 2005. This increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support increasing desktop computer demand in certain geographic regions, the growing mobile and CE markets, and an increase of $15 million in employee incentive 35 Table of Contents compensation programs, of which $7 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R. The 2005 fiscal period included a $19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Interest and Other Income. Net interest and other income was $16 million and $5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. This increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and short term investment balances as well as increases in the rates of return on investments. Income Tax Expense. Income tax (benefit) expense was $(13) million and $4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax (benefit) expense as a percentage of income before taxes was (3.4)% and 2.0% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Differences between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2019. In addition to the tax holidays, the tax provision for 2006 was favorably impacted by $22 million given the partial reduction of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets upon determination that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. A two year period is used due to the difficulty in accurately projecting income for longer periods of time given the cyclical nature of our industry. This assumption may change in the future based on fluctuating industry or company conditions. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent quarters when we update our estimates of future income. The 2005 effective tax rate benefited by approximately 0.7% from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. Fiscal Year 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year 2004 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $3.6 billion for 2005, an increase of 19.4% from 2004. Total unit shipments increased to 61.4 million as compared to 48.3 million for the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the non desktop market. For example, we shipped 3.6 million units to the DVR market in 2005 as compared to 1.0 million units in 2004. The growth in total unit shipments was partially offset by a $4 per unit decline in ASPs to $59 per unit for 2005. The changes in our revenue contribution by geographic region for 2005 compared to 2004 reflect our continued focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets, primarily in Asia. Revenue derived from OEMs increased in 2005 due to higher sales into the non desktop markets, which are serviced primarily by OEMs. Gross Margin. Gross margin percentage increased to 16.2% for 2005 from 15.2% for 2004. The increase in gross margin percentage was impacted by continuing improvements in quality, manufacturing cost efficiencies and product mix, partially offset by unit price declines. Gross margin also benefited from the ongoing accretive benefit of our head manufacturing operations. Our 2004 gross margin was impacted by start up expenses and other charges totaling $18 million relating to our head manufacturing operations acquired in July 2003. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses, consisting of R&D and SG&A, were 10.9% of net revenue in 2005, as compared to 10.1% of net revenue in 2004. R&D expense was $240 million and $202 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in R&D expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets, expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of $27 million in employee incentive compensation programs. R&D expense in 2004 included a $26 million charge for acquired in process research and development related to the Read Rite asset acquisition. SG&A expense was $155 million and $106 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support increasing PC demand in certain geographic regions and the growing mobile and CE markets and an increase of $16 million in employee incentive compensation programs. Fiscal 2005 included a $19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Interest and Other Income. Net interest and other income was $5 million and zero for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in net interest income in 2005 over 2004 was primarily due to a higher average cash and short term investment balance as well as an increase in the rates of return on investments. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $4 million in both 2005 and 2004. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 2.0% and 2.6% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Differences between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times 36 Table of Contents ranging from 2008 to 2019. The 2005 effective tax rate was benefited by approximately 0.7% from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. Liquidity and Capital Resources We ended 2006 with total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $699 million, an increase of $100 million from July 1, 2005. Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds. A portion of our available funds is invested in auction rate securities, which are short term investments in bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended June 30, 2006: Years Ended June 30, July 1, July 2, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 402 $ 461 $ 190 Investing activities (337 ) (314 ) (259 ) Financing activities 1 (7 ) 21 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 66 $ 140 $ (48 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during 2006 was $402 million as compared to $461 million during 2005 and $190 million for 2004. Cash flow from operations consists of net income, adjusted for non cash charges, plus or minus working capital changes. This represents our principal source of cash. Net cash used to fund working capital was $173 million for 2006 as compared to net cash provided by changes in working capital of $129 million for 2005 and net cash used to fund working capital of $88 million for 2004. Our working capital requirements depend upon the effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which measures how quickly a company can convert its products into cash through sales. The following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle for the three years ended 2006: Years Ended June 30, July 1, July 2, 2006 2005 2004 Days sales outstanding 39 40 39 Days in inventory 19 16 20 Days payables outstanding (64 ) (65 ) (61 ) Cash conversion cycle (6 ) (9 ) (2 ) The change in the cash conversion cycle for 2006 was primarily due to increased inventory levels compared to 2005. In addition to the cash conversion cycle, cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by prepayments to suppliers, incentive compensation, and a legal settlement payment of $24 million. The improvement in the cash conversion cycle for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to better alignment in the timing of our inventory build and sales schedules. Cash flows from operating activities for 2004 were impacted by the payment of a $45 million litigation settlement. From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors. We make these modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from our vendors payment term accommodations. 37 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2006 was $337 million as compared to $314 million for 2005 and $259 million for 2004. During 2006, cash used in investing activities consisted of $302 million for capital expenditures and $35 million for short term investments. During 2005, cash used in investing activities consisted of $233 million for capital expenditures and $81 million for short term investments. The net cash used in investing activities for 2004 consisted of $132 million for capital expenditures, $95 million for the Read Rite asset acquisition and $32 million for short term investments. The increases in capital expenditures in 2006 and 2005 were primarily a result of assets purchased to upgrade our head manufacturing capabilities, increased desktop and mobile hard drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets. Additionally, during 2006, we purchased our previously leased head wafer manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for $27 million. The increase in short term investments in 2005 was a result of additional investments in auction rate securities. For 2007, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million to $375 million consisting primarily of investments in advanced head technologies, new product platforms and capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for 2006 was $1 million as compared to net cash used for financing activities of $7 million for 2005 and net cash provided by financing activities of $21 million for 2004. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted of $78 million received through the exercise of common stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by repurchases of our common stock totaling $54 million and repayments of long term debt totaling $23 million. The net cash used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of $45 million used for common stock repurchases and $20 million for debt repayments partially offset by $58 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2004 consisted primarily of $24 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans and $14 million in net proceeds from long term debt partially offset by $16 million used for common stock repurchases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see Capital Commitments below), we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities. Capital Commitments The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of June 30, 2006 (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt, including current portion $ 25.0 $ 12.5 $ 12.5 $ $ Capital lease obligations 19.0 12.1 6.9 Operating leases 51.2 11.2 18.8 14.1 7.1 Purchase obligations* 4,673.0 2,628.9 2,044.1 Total $ 4,768.2 $ 2,664.7 $ 2,082.3 $ 14.1 $ 7.1 * Includes long term purchase agreements entered into before September 15, 2006. 38 Table of Contents Long Term Debt We have a $125 million credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) consisting of a revolving credit line (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation) and a term loan. Both the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on September 20, 2009 and are secured by our accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of our stock in foreign subsidiaries and other assets. For the year ended June 30, 2006, we had no borrowings on the revolving credit line and the average variable rate on our term loan was 6.5%. The term loan requires quarterly principal payments of approximately $3 million. Principal payments made on the term loan increase the amount of revolving credit available. At June 30, 2006, $97.5 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line, $25 million was outstanding on the term loan, and there was $2.5 million in outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains specific financial covenants. We are required to maintain an available liquidity level of $300 million at the end of each quarter. We define available liquidity as cash plus eligible trade receivables. Should our available liquidity be less than $300 million, we would then be subject to minimum EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) requirements and capital expenditure limitations. As of June 30, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants. The terms of the Senior Credit Facility require that we deliver to the lenders our audited financial statements within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year. As a result of the independent investigation into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of the Special Committee, we were delayed in completing our fiscal year 2006 audited financial statements, this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q as of and for the period ending September 29, 2006. At our request, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility agreed that we would not be in default under the Senior Credit Facility as a result of our failure to timely deliver our 2006 audited financial statements, or the management discussion and analysis for our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q as of and for the period ending September 29, 2006, provided that the lenders receive the 2006 audited financial statements, the management discussion and analysis for our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q as of and for the period ending September 29, 2006, and all other documents reasonably requested by the lenders before the earlier of: (a) 30 days following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10 K or (b) January 12, 2007. We intend to deliver our audited financial statements to the lenders on or around the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Purchase Orders In the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders to suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. We may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process. We have entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers. The commitments are subject to minimum quality requirements. In addition, the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and future price negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in Purchase obligations in the table above. From time to time, we enter into other long term purchase agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally, future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and quality of the suppliers products remaining competitive. These arrangements are not included under Purchase obligations in the table above. Please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of risks related to these commitments. Forward Exchange Contracts We purchase short term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk, for our current forward exchange contract commitments. 39 Table of Contents Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $250 million of our common stock in open market transactions. The term of the program is a five year period from November 17, 2005 to November 17, 2010. We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows. During 2006, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $54 million. During 2005, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $45 million. Since the inception of the program and through November 10, 2006, we have repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total cost of $115 million (including commissions). We may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the foreseeable future. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our Senior Credit Facility will continue to remain available. Also, our ability to sustain our working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our liquidity and cash flows to improve the efficiency and capability of its existing hard drive and head manufacturing operations. Critical Accounting Policies We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material. Revenue and Accounts Receivable In accordance with standard industry practice, we have agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs. In accordance with current accounting standards, we recognize revenue upon delivery to OEMs and resellers and record a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers. We base these adjustments on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical pricing information. If end market demand for hard drives declines significantly, we may have to increase sell through incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an increase in our allowances, which could adversely impact operating results. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition, we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily 40 Table of Contents on our historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could affect operating results. We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which could negatively affect operating results. Warranty We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers costs of repair or replacement of the hard drive over the warranty period, which generally ranges from one to five years. We have comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty, which include specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product type. If actual product return trends or costs to repair returned products demonstrate significant differences from expectations, a change in the warranty provision is made. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material. For a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre existing warranty provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Inventory We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. We record inventory write downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances. We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog, estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products, which may require an increase in inventory balance adjustments that could negatively affect operating results. Litigation and Other Contingencies We apply SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies. Accordingly, we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable (Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from managements estimates. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. We record estimated liabilities for tax uncertainties. To the extent a tax position does not meet a probable level of certainty, a liability is established based on the best estimate of the amount that will not be sustained. However, the actual liability in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously recorded tax liabilities. 41 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation We account for all stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 R, Share Based Payment. Under these provisions, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Under SFAS No. 123 R, we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans (including shares issued under our stock option plans and ESPP) in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related interpretations (APB No. 25), and followed the pro forma net income, pro forma income per share, and stock based compensation plan disclosure requirements set forth in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. All other types of equity awards were previously accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The fair values of all stock options granted subsequent to April 1, 2005, were estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all options granted prior to April 1, 2005, and all ESPP shares were estimated using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial and the Black Scholes Merton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The interpretation applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN No. 48 and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FIN No. 48 could have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 could have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We purchase short term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract maturity dates do not exceed six months. We do not purchase short term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. Thai Baht contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. All other contracts are designated as fair value hedges. See Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 42 Table of Contents As of June 30, 2006, we had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts (in millions, except weighted average contract rate): Contract Weighted Average Unrealized Amount Contract Rate* Gain Foreign currency forward contracts: Thai Baht $ 261.5 38.34 $ 1.3 Euro $ 1.1 0.78 British Pound Sterling $ 1.3 0.54 * Expressed in units of foreign currency per dollar. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements. Disclosure About Other Market Risks Variable Interest Rate Risk At our option, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to three months) or a base rate, plus a margin. If LIBOR or the base rate increases, our interest payments would also increase. At June 30, 2006, we had a $25 million term loan outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. A one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the Senior Credit Facility would increase interest expense by approximately $0.2 million annually. 43 Table of Contents
