We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our Company We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are key components of computers, including desktop and notebook computers (PCs), data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic (CE) devices. We sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufactures (ODMs) for use in computer systems, subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers, notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers, workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders (DVRs), and satellite and cable set top boxes (STBs). We also sell our hard drives as stand alone storage products and integrate them into our own WD branded external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music, photography, video, and other data. 33 Table of Contents Hard drives provide non volatile data storage, which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes (GB) to 1 terabyte (TB), nominal rotation speeds of 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and offer interfaces including both Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE) and Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA). We also embed our hard drives into WD branded external storage appliances that utilize interfaces such as USB 2.0, external SATA, FireWiretm and Ethernet network connections. In addition, we recently announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than previous designs. We manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies (HSAs) in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads in California, and head gimbal assemblies (HGAs) in Thailand. Following our planned acquisition of Komag, Incorporated (Komag), a leading media manufacturer and one of our current suppliers, we will also design in California and manufacture in Malaysia most of our required media and substrates. For geographical financial data, see Part II, Item 8, Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. On June 28, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of Komag for a value of approximately $1.0 billion. The planned acquisition of Komag is intended to strengthen our production effeciencies and enhance our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating media. The planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender offer at $32.25 per share for all the outstanding shares of Komag common stock, followed by a merger of our indirect wholly owned subsidiary into Komag in which the remaining shareholders of Komag will receive $32.25 in cash per share. The planned acquisition is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2007. We intend to fund the planned acquisition, including the expected repurchase of Komags convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses, through a combination of cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to $1.3 billion. Results of Operations Fiscal 2007 Overview In 2007, our net revenue increased by 26% to $5.5 billion on unit shipments of 97 million as compared to $4.3 billion and 73 million units, respectively, in 2006. In 2007, 43% of our revenue was derived from non desktop sources including CE products, enterprise applications, notebook computers and retail sales as compared to 29% in 2006. Gross margin percentage decreased to 16.5% from 19.1% in 2006. Operating income increased by $49 million to $415 million. As a percentage of net revenue, operating income was 7.6% in 2007 compared to 8.4% 2006. We generated $618 million in cash flow from operations in 2007 compared with $368 million in 2006, finishing the year with $907 million in cash and short term investments, an increase of $208 million from the prior year. We utilized $73 million to repurchase 4 million shares of our common stock and $43 million to repay long term debt. Summary Comparison of 2007, 2006 and 2005 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended June 29, 2007 June 30, 2006 July 1, 2005 Revenue, net $ 5,468 100 % $ 4,341 100 % $ 3,639 100 % Gross margin 900 16.5 829 19.1 590 16.2 Operating expenses 485 8.9 463 10.7 395 10.9 Operating income 415 7.6 366 8.4 195 5.3 Non operating income 28 0.5 16 0.4 5 0.2 Income before income taxes 443 8.1 382 8.8 200 5.5 Income tax (benefit) expense (121 ) (2.2 ) (13 ) (0.3 ) 4 0.1 Net income 564 10.3 395 9.1 196 5.4 34 Table of Contents The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, summary information regarding volume shipments, average selling prices (ASPs) and revenues by geography, channel and product (in millions, except percentages and ASPs): Years Ended June 29, June 30, July 1, 2007 2006 2005 Net revenue $ 5,468 $ 4,341 $ 3,639 Unit shipments 97 73 61 ASPs (per unit) $ 57 $ 59 $ 59 Revenues by Geography(%) Americas 37 % 36 % 38 % Europe 29 28 29 Asia 34 36 33 Revenues by Channel(%) OEM 48 % 54 % 58 % Distributors 36 39 36 Branded products 16 7 6 Revenues by Product(%) Desktop computers 57 % 71 % 79 % Non desktop sources 43 29 21 Fiscal Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $5.5 billion for 2007, an increase of 26% from 2006. Total unit shipments increased to 97 million as compared to 73 million for the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the non desktop market, including mobile, CE, enterprise and branded products. For example, we shipped 12 million drives to the mobile market in 2007 as compared to 5 million units in 2006. Additionally, we shipped 10 million units to the DVR market in 2007 as compared to 7 million units in 2006. ASPs declined to $57 due to normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop, and consumer electronics markets. Changes in revenue by geography generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives. Changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of branded products due to the growing worldwide acceptance of our WD My Booktm and WD Passport external digital storage appliances. Gross Margin. Gross margin for 2007 was $900 million, an increase of $71 million, or 9% over the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 16.5% in 2007 from 19.1% in 2006. The factors contributing to this decrease include normal technology price declines and a more competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop, and consumer electronics markets. In addition, gross margin in 2006 benefited from a more favorable supply/demand balance. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development (RD) and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses decreased to 8.9% of net revenue in 2007 compared to 10.7% in 2006. RD expense was $306 million in 2007, an increase of $9 million, or 3% over the prior year. The increase in RD expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets and expenditures for advanced head technologies, partially offset by a decrease of $2 million in variable incentive compensation programs. SGA expense was $179 million in 2007, an increase of $13 million, or 8% as compared to 2006. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to an increase of $19 million in stock based compensation expense and other long term employee incentive programs, offset by a $5 million decrease in software write offs that occurred in 2006. Interest and Other Income. Net interest and other income was $28 million and $16 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and short term investment balances. 35 Table of Contents Income Tax Benefit. Income tax benefit was $121 million and $13 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes was 27% and 3% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Differences between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive programs and reductions to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We have tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2022. In addition to the tax holidays, the tax provision was impacted by favorable adjustments to the companys valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $126 and $22 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These adjustments were based upon determination that it was more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed the remaining valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence including our history of cumulative pretax income and the increased likelihood of our ability to generate profits in the future. In 2006, we released a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for periods of longer than two years given the cyclical nature of our industry. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company conditions. Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $4.3 billion for 2006, an increase of 19% from 2005. Total unit shipments increased to 73 million as compared to 61 million for the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the non desktop market, including mobile, CE and branded products. For example, we shipped 5 million drives to the mobile market in 2006 as compared to 1 million units in 2005. Additionally, we shipped 7 million units to the DVR market in 2006 as compared to 4 million units in 2005. ASPs remained at a relatively constant level of $59 due to an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold offset by moderate price declines. Revenue contribution by geographic region for 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects our focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets, primarily in Asia. Changes in revenue by channel reflect overall market demand fluctuations for hard drives. Gross Margin. Gross margin for 2006 was $829 million, an increase of $239 million, or 41% over the prior year. Gross margin percentage increased to 19.1% in 2006 from 16.2% in 2005. Gross margin in 2006 benefited from a more favorable supply/demand balance. In addition, gross margin was favorably impacted in 2006 by the following factors: 1) manufacturing efficiencies, 2) lower customer returns resulting from ongoing quality improvements that favorably impacted warranty obligations, and 3) an increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold. Moderate price declines somewhat offset the favorable impact of the aforementioned factors. During 2006 and 2005, our warranty accrual for prior quarters shipments was favorably adjusted by approximately $30 million and $1 million, respectively, as a result of improvements in quality and customer return rates and their expected impact on future levels of customer returns under warranty. Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses, consisting of research and development (RD) and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses, were 10.7% of net revenue in 2006, as compared to 10.9% in 2005. RD expense was $297 million in 2006, an increase of $57 million, or 24% over the prior year. The increase in RD expense was primarily related to the development of new product platforms in support of our entry into new markets, expenditures for advanced head technologies and an increase of $18 million in employee incentive compensation programs, of which $12 million related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 R. SGA expense was $166 million in 2006, an increase of $11 million, or 7% as compared to 2005. This increase in SGA expense was primarily due to an expansion of sales resources to support increasing desktop computer demand in certain geographic regions, the growing mobile and CE markets, an increase of $15 million in employee incentive compensation programs, of which $7 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, and a $5 million software write off. The 2005 fiscal period included a $19 million charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit. Interest and Other Income. Net interest and other income was $16 million and $5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. This increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash and short term investment balances as well as increases in the rates of return on investments. 36 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense (Benefit). Income tax (benefit) expense was $(13) million and $4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax (benefit) expense as a percentage of income before taxes was (3)% and 2% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Differences between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2022. In addition to the tax holidays, the tax provision for 2006 was favorably impacted by $22 million given the partial reduction of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets upon determination that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized. The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. A two year period was used due to the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for longer periods of time given the cyclical nature of our industry. The 2005 effective tax rate benefited by approximately 0.7% from the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies. Liquidity and Capital Resources We ended 2007 with total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $907 million, an increase of $208 million from June 30, 2006. Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds. A portion of our available funds is invested in auction rate securities, which are short term investments in bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash flows for the three years ended June 29, 2007: Years Ended June 29, June 30, July 1, 2007 2006 2005 Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 618 $ 368 $ 421 Investing activities (383 ) (303 ) (274 ) Financing activities (86 ) 1 (7 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 149 $ 66 $ 140 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was $618 million as compared to $368 million during 2006 and $421 million for 2005. Cash flow from operations consists of net income, adjusted for non cash charges, plus or minus working capital changes. This represents our principal source of cash. Net cash used to fund working capital was $78 million for 2007 as compared to $207 million for 2006 and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $89 million for 2005. Our working capital requirements depend upon the effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which measures how quickly a company can convert its products into cash through sales. The following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle for the three years ended 2007: Years Ended June 29, June 30, July 1, 2007 2006 2005 Days sales outstanding 45 39 40 Days in inventory 20 19 16 Days payables outstanding (66 ) (64 ) (65 ) Cash conversion cycle (1 ) (6 ) (9 ) The increase in the cash conversion cycle for 2007 was primarily due to our days sales outstanding (DSOs), which increased by six days from 2006. This increase was primarily due to the discontinuance of an early pay program with one of our larger customers and increasing sales to branded products customers and other customers who have longer payment terms. 37 Table of Contents From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors. We make these modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from our vendors payment term accommodations. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2007 was $383 million as compared to $303 million for 2006 and $274 million for 2005. During 2007, cash used in investing activities consisted of $324 million for capital expenditures and $59 million for short term investments. During 2006, cash used in investing activities consisted of $268 million for capital expenditures and $35 million for short term investments. The increase in capital expenditures in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily consists of equipment purchased to support our investments in advanced head technologies, new product platforms and capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio. The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily a result of assets purchased to upgrade our head manufacturing capabilities, increased desktop and mobile hard drive production capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets. Additionally, during 2006, we purchased our previously leased head wafer manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for $27 million. For 2008, we expect capital additions to be between $600 million and $650 million, of which approximately $200 million will be utilized for the expansion of our head wafer fabrication capacity. Depreciation and amortization for 2008 is expected to be between $270 and $290 million. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for 2007 was $86 million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1 million for 2006 and net cash used in financing activities of $7 million for 2005. The net cash used in financing activities in 2007 consisted of $73 million used for repurchases of our common stock and $43 million used for repayments of long term debt, offset by $30 million received through the exercise of common stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted of $78 million received through the exercise of common stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by $54 million used in repurchases of our common stock and $23 million used for repayments of long term debt. The net cash used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of $45 million used for repurchases of our common stock and $20 million for debt repayments, offset by $58 million received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see Capital Commitments below), we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities. Capital Commitments The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of June 29, 2007 (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt, including current portion $ $ $ $ $ Capital lease obligations 22 12 10 Operating leases 44 11 20 8 5 Purchase obligations(1)(2) 3,338 2,584 754 Total $ 3,404 $ 2,607 $ 784 $ 8 $ 5 (1) Includes long term purchase agreements entered into before August 16, 2007. (2) These amounts do not reflect the reduction to commitments resulting from our planned acquisition of Komag. 38 Table of Contents In anticipation of our planned acquisition of Komag, we intend to fund the transaction, including the expected repurchase of Komags convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses, through a combination of our cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to $1.3 billion. Long Term Debt We maintained a $125 million credit facility (Senior Credit Facility) with a termination date of September 20, 2009. The facility provided for a revolving credit line (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation) and a term loan. The term loan was paid in full as of March 30, 2007, a letter of termination was submitted for the Senior Credit Facility on June 28th, 2007, and termination was finalized during the first quarter of 2008. Purchase Orders In the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders to suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. We may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process. We have entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers. The commitments are subject to minimum quality requirements. In addition, the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and future price negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in Purchase obligations in the table above. From time to time, we enter into other long term purchase agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally, future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and quality of the suppliers products remaining competitive. These arrangements are not included under Purchase obligations in the table above. Please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of risks related to these commitments. Forward Exchange Contracts We purchase short term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk, for our current forward exchange contract commitments. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $250 million of our common stock in open market transactions. The term of the program is a five year period from November 17, 2005 to November 17, 2010. We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows. During 2007, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of 39 Table of Contents common stock at a total cost of $73 million. Subsequent to the end of 2007, we purchased 0.8 million shares for approximately $16 million. During 2006, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $54 million. Since the inception of the program and through August 16, 2007, we have repurchased 15.1 million shares for a total cost of $204 million. Subject to any limitations that may be set forth in our proposed bridge loan facility to be entered into with our planned acquisition of Komag, we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the foreseeable future. Our ability to sustain our working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material. Revenue and Accounts Receivable In accordance with standard industry practice, we have agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions and other incentive programs. In accordance with current accounting standards, we recognize revenue upon delivery to OEMs, ODMs and resellers and record a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers. We base these adjustments on anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical pricing information. If end market demand for hard drives declines significantly, we may have to increase sell through incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an increase in our allowances, which could adversely impact operating results. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition, we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could affect operating results. We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which could negatively affect operating results. Warranty We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a statistical warranty tracking model to help with our estimates and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product type. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates. We review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any 40 Table of Contents changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair. For a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre existing warranty provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Inventory We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out basis) or net realizable value. We record inventory write downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances. We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products, which may require an increase in inventory balance adjustments that could negatively affect operating results. Litigation and Other Contingencies We apply SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies. Accordingly, we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable (Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K). The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from managements estimates. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. We record estimated liabilities for tax uncertainties. To the extent a tax position does not meet a probable level of certainty, a liability is established based on the best estimate of the amount that will not be sustained. However, the actual liability in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously recorded tax liabilities. Stock Based Compensation We account for all stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 R, Share Based Payment. Under these provisions, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Under SFAS No. 123 R, we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, we accounted for stock based employee compensation plans (including shares issued under our stock option plans and ESPP) in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related interpretations (APB No. 25), and followed the pro forma net income, pro forma income per share, and stock based compensation plan disclosure requirements set forth in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. All other types of equity awards were previously accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123. 41 Table of Contents The fair values of all stock options granted on and subsequent to January 1, 2005, were estimated using a binomial model and the fair values of all options granted on and prior to December 31, 2004, and all ESPP shares were estimated using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial and the Black Scholes Merton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The interpretation applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We purchase short term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract maturity dates do not exceed six months. We do not purchase short term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Thai Baht and Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. All other contracts are designated as fair value hedges. See Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 42 Table of Contents As of June 29, 2007, we had outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts (in millions, except weighted average contract rate): Contract Weighted Average Unrealized Amount Contract Rate* Gain (Loss) Foreign currency forward contracts: Thai Bhat $ 256.1 33.10 $ 0.1 Malaysian Ringgit $ 231.8 3.41 $ (1.1 ) Euro $ 2.9 0.74 British Pound Sterling $ 1.9 0.50 * Expressed in units of foreign currency per dollar. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, total realized transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
