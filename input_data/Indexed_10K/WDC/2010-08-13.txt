Our Company We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks (magnetic media) to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are key components of computers, including desktop and notebook computers (PCs), data storage subsystems and many consumer electronic (CE) devices. We sell our products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) for use in computer systems, subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers, notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers, workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders (DVRs) and satellite and cable set top boxes (STBs). We also sell our hard drives as stand alone storage products by integrating them into finished enclosures, embedding application software and offering the products as WD branded external storage appliances for personal data backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music, photographs, video and other digital data. 37 Table of Contents Hard drives provide non volatile data storage, which means that the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 80 gigabytes (GB) to 2 terabytes (TB), nominal rotation speeds up to 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM), and offer interfaces including Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (EIDE), Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) and Serial Attached SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) (SAS). We also embed our hard drives into WD branded external storage appliances using interfaces such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0, USB 3.0, external SATA, FireWiretm and Ethernet network connections with capacities of 160 GB up to 8 TB. In addition, we offer a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives, utilizing our WD GreenPower Technologytm. We also design, develop, manufacture and sell solid state drives and media players. A solid state drive is a storage device that uses semiconductor, non volatile media, rather than magnetic media and magnetic heads, to store and allow fast access to data. We sell our solid state drives worldwide to OEMs and distributors for use in the embedded systems and client PC markets. A media player is a device that connects to a users television, the Internet or home theater system and plays digital movies, music and photos from any of our WD branded external hard drives, other USB mass storage devices or content services accessed over the Internet. We sell our media players worldwide to resellers and retailers under the WD brand. In November 2009, we entered the traditional enterprise market with the WD S25, 2.5 inch, SAS interface hard drives. The WD S25 drive provides up to 300 GB of storage suitable for both mission critical enterprise server and enterprise storage applications, as well as data centers and large data arrays. Results of Operations Fiscal 2010 Overview In 2010, our net revenue increased by 32% to $9.8 billion on hard drive shipments of 194 million units as compared to $7.5 billion and 146 million units, respectively, in 2009. In 2010, 64% of our hard drive net revenue was derived from non desktop markets, including notebook computers, CE products, enterprise applications, and WD branded product sales, as compared to 62% in 2009. Hard drive average selling price (ASP) decreased to $50 in 2010 from $51 in 2009. Gross margin percentage increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 17.9% in 2009. Operating income increased by $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in 2010. Operating income was $519 million in 2009, which included a $14 million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc. (SiliconSystems), $112 million of restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of assets from our substrate manufacturing facility in Sarawak, Malaysia. As a percentage of net revenue, operating income was 15.5% in 2010 compared to 7.0% in 2009. Net income in 2010 was $1.4 billion, or $5.93 per diluted share, compared to $470 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, in 2009. On June 30, 2010, we acquired the facilities, equipment, intellectual property and working capital of the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya Corporation and Hoya Magnetics Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Hoya). The acquisition is intended to augment our existing magnetic media operations, strengthening our ability to meet anticipated growth in demand for hard drives. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $233 million and was funded with available cash. For the September quarter, we expect our revenue to be relatively flat with the June quarter as a result of lower than historical demand growth rates and competitive pricing conditions. 38 Table of Contents Summary Comparison of 2010, 2009 and 2008 The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, summary information from our consolidated statements of income by dollars and percentage of net revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 2, 2010 July 3, 2009 June 27, 2008 Revenue, net $ 9,850 100.0 % $ 7,453 100.0 % $ 8,074 100.0 % Gross margin 2,401 24.4 1,337 17.9 1,739 21.5 RD and SGA 876 8.9 710 9.5 684 8.5 Acquired in process research and development 14 0.2 49 0.6 Restructuring and other, net 94 1.3 Operating income 1,525 15.5 519 7.0 1,006 12.4 Other expense, net (5 ) (0.1 ) (18 ) (0.2 ) (25 ) (0.3 ) Income before income taxes 1,520 15.4 501 6.7 981 12.1 Income tax provision 138 1.4 31 0.4 114 1.4 Net income 1,382 14.0 470 6.3 867 10.7 The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, summary information regarding unit shipments, ASPs and revenues by geography, channel and product (in millions, except percentages and ASPs): Years Ended July 2, July 3, June 27, 2010 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 9,850 $ 7,453 $ 8,074 Unit shipments* 194 146 133 ASPs (per unit)* $ 50 $ 51 $ 59 Revenues by Geography(%) Americas 24 % 24 % 31 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 23 27 30 Asia 53 49 39 Revenues by Channel(%) OEMs 51 % 54 % 51 % Distributors 31 26 31 Retailers 18 20 18 Revenues by Product(%) Non desktop sources 64 % 62 % 56 % Desktop hard drives 36 38 44 * Based on sales of hard drive units only. Non hard drive units were not material. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. (U.S. GAAP), operating results for Hoya, SiliconSystems, and Komag, Incorporated (Komag) which were acquired on June 30, 2010, March 27, 2009 and September 5, 2007, respectively, prior to the dates of their acquisitions are not included in our operating results. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $9.8 billion for 2010, an increase of 32% from 2009. Total hard drive shipments increased to 194 million units as compared to 146 million units for the prior year. The increase in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in unit shipments due to the strong demand for hard drives, particularly in the mobile PC market. We shipped 80 million mobile drives in 2010 as compared to 55 million units in 2009. The increase in mobile 39 Table of Contents unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings. Changes in revenue by geography generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics, as well as demand strength in Asia, which continues to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region. Changes in revenue by channel are a result of normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics. In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2010, these programs represented 8% of gross revenues compared to 11% in 2009. These amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product. Gross Margin. Gross margin for 2010 was $2.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 80% over the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to 24.4% in 2010 from 17.9% in 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher volume, lower costs, a favorable product mix and a moderate pricing environment. Operating Expenses. Total research and development (RD) expense and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense decreased to 8.9% of net revenue in 2010 compared to 9.5% in 2009. RD expense was $611 million in 2010, an increase of $102 million, or 20% over the prior year. This increase in RD expense was primarily due to a $68 million increase relating to product development to support new programs and a $34 million increase in variable incentive compensation. As a percentage of net revenue, RD expense decreased to 6.2% in 2010 compared to 6.8% in 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue in 2010 compared to 2009. SGA expense was $265 million in 2010, an increase of $64 million, or 32%, as compared to 2009. This increase in SGA expense was primarily due to $27 million of expense related to litigation settlements, a $19 million increase in variable incentive compensation and an $18 million increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions. SGA expense as a percentage of net revenue remained consistent at 2.7% in 2010 and 2009. During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems. This charge relates to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and, therefore, the fair value of the development effort did not qualify for capitalization and was immediately expensed. During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of our substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in Sarawak, Malaysia. Other Income (Expense). Other expense, net was $5 million in 2010 compared to $18 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily due to no impairment charges related to our auction rate securities in 2010, compared to $10 million in other than temporary losses in 2009, as well as decreases in the variable interest rate on a lower amount of debt. Income Tax Provision. Income tax expense was $138 million in 2010 as compared to $31 million in 2009. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 9% in 2010 compared to 6% for 2009. In 2009, income tax expense included a provision of $42 million offset by $6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the U.S. Federal research and development tax credit enacted into law in October 2008, and a favorable adjustment of $5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits. Differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various dates through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax credits. We recognized a net $94 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2010. As of July 2, 2010, we had approximately $230 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years. Fiscal Year 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year 2008 Net Revenue. Net revenue was $7.5 billion for 2009, a decrease of 8% from 2008. Total unit shipments of hard drives increased to 146 million as compared to 133 million for the prior year. The decrease in revenue primarily resulted from a decline in our ASPs which reflected a more competitive pricing environment, particularly in the notebook and 40 Table of Contents branded markets. The decline in our ASPs was partially offset by an increase in unit shipments of mobile drives. We shipped 56 million mobile drives in 2009 as compared to 37 million units in 2008. The increase in mobile unit shipments was driven by continued strength in notebook and netbook PC demand, coupled with increased customer preference for our product offerings. Changes in revenue by geography and by channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics as well as demand strength in Asia, which continued to be driven by the concentration of global manufacturing in that region. Changes in revenue by channel are a result of increases in sales of mobile hard drives to OEMs. In accordance with standard industry practice, we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. For 2009, these programs represented 11% of gross revenues compared to 10% in 2008. These amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product. Gross Margin. Gross margin for 2009 was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $402 million, or 23% over the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 17.9% in 2009 from 21.5% in 2008. This decrease is due to a more competitive pricing environment primarily resulting from an increase in product offerings in the mobile and branded markets. Operating Expenses. Total RD expense and SGA expense increased to 9.5% of net revenue in 2009 compared to 8.5% in 2008. RD expense was $509 million in 2009, an increase of $45 million, or 10% over the prior year. This increase in RD expense includes $76 million relating to product development to support new programs offset by a $31 million decrease in variable incentive compensation. As a percentage of net revenue, RD expense increased to 6.8% in 2009 compared to 5.7% in 2008 primarily due to continued investment in product development. SGA expense was $201 million in 2009, a decrease of $19 million, or 8.6%, as compared to 2008. This decrease in SGA expense primarily resulted from a $19 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and a $6 million insurance recovery, offset by a $6 million net increase in the expansion of our sales and marketing presence into new regions. SGA expense was 2.7% as a percentage of net revenue in both 2009 and 2008. During 2009, we recorded a $14 million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of SiliconSystems. During 2008, we recorded a $49 million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of Komag. These charges relate to projects that were not ready for commercial production and had no alternative future use and, therefore, the fair value of the development effort did not quality for capitalization and was immediately expensed. During 2009, we also recorded $112 million in restructuring charges and an $18 million gain on the sale of our substrate manufacturing facility, and related assets, in Sarawak, Malaysia. Other Income (Expense). Net interest and other expense was $18 million in 2009 compared to $25 million in 2008. This change was primarily due to a decrease in the variable interest rate on our debt and a $3 million decrease in losses on our auction rate securities. Income Tax Provision. Income tax expense was $31 million in 2009 compared to $114 million in 2008. Tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 6% in 2009 compared to 12% for 2008. In 2009, income tax expense included a provision of $42 million offset by $6 million in tax benefits related to the extension of the U.S. Federal research and development tax credit, enacted into law in October 2008, and a favorable adjustment of $5 million to previously recorded tax accruals and credits. In 2008, tax expense included net charges of $60 million for taxes incurred upon the license of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary in our first fiscal quarter. Differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various dates through 2022 and the current year generation of income tax credits. We recognized a $29 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits during 2009. As of July 3, 2009, we had approximately $136 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate in subsequent years. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We ended 2010 with total cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, an increase of $940 million from July 3, 2009. The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the three years ended July 2, 2010: Years Ended July 2, July 3, June 27, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,942 $ 1,305 $ 1,399 Investing activities (986 ) (551 ) (1,321 ) Financing activities (16 ) (64 ) 326 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 940 $ 690 $ 404 Our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of available funds. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through the foreseeable future. Our ability to sustain our working capital position is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was $1.9 billion as compared to $1.3 billion for 2009 and $1.4 billion for 2008. Cash flow from operating activities consists of net income, adjusted for non cash charges, plus or minus working capital changes. This represents our principal source of cash. Net cash used to fund working capital was $37 million for 2010 as compared to net cash provided by working capital changes of $198 million for 2009 and $22 million for 2008. Our working capital requirements primarily depend on the effective management of our cash conversion cycle, which measures how quickly we can convert our products into cash through sales. The average quarterly cash conversion cycles for the three years ended 2010 were as follows: Years Ended July 2, July 3, June 27, 2010 2009 2008 Days sales outstanding 46 47 46 Days in inventory 23 26 27 Days payables outstanding (72 ) (67 ) (67 ) Cash conversion cycle (3 ) 6 6 For 2010, our average days sales outstanding (DSOs) decreased by 1 day, days in inventory (DIOs) decreased by 3 days, and days payables outstanding (DPOs) increased by 5 days. The decreases in average DSOs and DIOs were primarily the result of the strong demand environment that existed during the first three quarters of 2010, which led to better sales linearity and faster inventory turns during the corresponding period. DSOs and DIOs for the fourth quarter were 48 and 28, respectively. Changes in DPOs are generally related to production volume and the timing of purchases during the period. From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our vendors. We make modifications primarily to manage our vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications through negotiations with our vendors or by granting to, or receiving from, our vendors payment term accommodations. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 was $986 million as compared to $551 million for 2009 and $1.3 billion for 2008. During 2010, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $737 million for capital expenditures, $233 million used for the acquisition of the magnetic media sputtering operations of Hoya and $20 million 42 Table of Contents used for the acquisition of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. During 2009, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $519 million for capital expenditures and $63 million for the acquisition of SiliconSystems, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $29 million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. During 2008, cash used in investing activities consisted of $927 million for the acquisition of Komag, net of cash acquired, and $615 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by net cash provided by short term investment activity of $221 million. Capital expenditures in 2010 primarily consisted of the expansion of our head wafer fabrication facilities, continued investment in advanced head technologies and increased capacity for our broadening and growing product portfolio. For fiscal 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be between 7% and 8% of revenue, plus approximately $200 million related to the conversion of our head wafer fabrication facilities to utilize 8 inch wafers from 6 inch wafers and expenditures to optimize the output from our recently acquired magnetic media sputtering operations. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $650 million for fiscal 2011. Our cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid money market funds which are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Government agency securities. We also have auction rate securities that are classified as long term investments as they are expected to be held until secondary markets become available. These investments are currently accounted for as available for sale securities and recorded at fair value within other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated market values of these investments are subject to fluctuation. During the year ended July 2, 2010, we sold $3 million of auction rate securities, reducing the carrying value of these investments to $15 million. Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities for 2010 was $16 million as compared to $64 million for 2009. Net cash provided by financing activities was $326 million for 2008. Net cash used by financing activities in 2010 consisted of $82 million used to repay long term debt, partially offset by a net $66 million provided by employee stock plans. Net cash used by financing activities in 2009 consisted of $36 million used to repurchase our common stock, $27 million used to repay long term debt and a net $1 million used by employee stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 consisted of $500 million in net proceeds from debt and a net $149 million provided by employee stock plans, offset by a $250 million repayment of convertible debentures assumed in the acquisition of Komag, $60 million used to repurchase our common stock and $13 million used to repay other long term debt. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility lease commitments incurred in the normal course of business and certain indemnification provisions (see Contractual Obligations and Commitments below), we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of July 2, 2010 (in millions): Less than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt, including current portion $ 400 $ 106 $ 294 $ $ Operating leases 99 15 27 22 35 Unrecognized tax benefits 135 14 121 Purchase obligations 4,210 3,566 637 6 1 Total $ 4,844 $ 3,687 $ 972 $ 149 $ 36 43 Table of Contents Long Term Debt In February 2008, Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (WDTI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a five year Credit Agreement that provided for a $500 million term loan facility. As of July 2, 2010, the remaining balance of the term loan facility was $400 million, which requires principal payments totaling $106 million in 2011, $144 million in 2012 and $150 million in 2013. See Part II, Item 8, Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Purchase Orders In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase orders with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time prior to shipment of the components. We also enter into purchase orders with suppliers for capital equipment that are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the equipment. Our ability to change or cancel a capital equipment purchase order without penalty depends on the nature of the equipment being ordered. In some cases, we may be obligated to pay for certain costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a purchase order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work in process of components or capital equipment. We have entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers, which contain minimum quantity requirements. However, the dollar amount of the purchases may depend on the specific products ordered, achievement of pre defined quantity or quality specifications or future price negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase requirements are included in Purchase obligations in the table above. We have also entered into long term purchase agreements with various component suppliers that carry fixed volumes and pricing which obligate us to make certain future purchases, contingent on certain conditions of performance, quality and technology of the vendors components. These arrangements are included under Purchase obligations in the table above. We enter into, from time to time, other long term purchase agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally, future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and quality of the suppliers products remaining competitive. These arrangements are not included under Purchase obligations in the table above. Please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of risks related to these commitments. Foreign Exchange Contracts We purchase short term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See Part II, Item 7A, under the heading Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk, for a description of our current foreign exchange contract commitments and Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, products or services to be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements. 44 Table of Contents Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of July 2, 2010, our total cash liability representing unrecognized tax benefits was $135 million. We estimate the timing of the future payments of these liabilities to be within the next two to five years. See Part II, Item 8, Note 9 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for information regarding our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors previously authorized us to repurchase $750 million of our common stock in open market transactions under a stock repurchase program through March 31, 2013. Since the inception of this program in 2005, through July 2, 2010, we have repurchased 18 million shares for a total cost of $284 million. We expect stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash flows. We may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem appropriate and market conditions allow. We did not make any repurchases of common stock under the authorized stock repurchase program during 2010. Subsequent to July 2, 2010 through August 13, 2010, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total cost of $50 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and shareholders equity. We have adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material. Revenue and Accounts Receivable In accordance with standard industry practice, we provide distributors and retailers (collectively referred to as resellers) with limited price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions, and we provide resellers and OEMs with other sales incentive programs. At the time we recognize revenue to resellers and OEMs, we record a reduction of revenue for estimated price protection until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers and we also record a reduction of revenue for the other programs in effect. We base these adjustments on several factors including anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period, resellers sell through and inventory levels, estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, historical pricing information and customer claim processing. If customer demand for hard drives or market conditions differ from our expectations, our operating results could be materially affected. We also have programs under which we reimburse qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing expenditures which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. These amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions, seasonal demand, competitor actions, channel mix and overall availability of product. Since 2008, total sales incentive and marketing programs have ranged from 7% to 12% of gross revenues per quarter. Changes in future customer demand and market conditions may require us to adjust our incentive programs as a percentage of gross revenue from the current range. Adjustments to revenues due to changes in accruals for these programs related to revenues reported in prior periods have averaged 0.1% of quarterly gross revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition, we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories and establish reserves based on a combination of past due receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could materially affect operating results. We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be required, which could materially affect operating results. 45 Table of Contents Warranty We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a statistical warranty tracking model to help prepare our estimates and assist us in exercising judgment in determining the underlying estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product type. Our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited field experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates. We review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to repair. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ significantly from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected. For a summary of historical changes in estimates related to pre existing warranty provisions, refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Inventory We value inventories at the lower of cost (first in, first out and weighted average methods) or net realizable value. We use the first in, first out method to value the cost of the majority of our inventories, while we use the weighted average method to value precious metal inventories. Weighted average cost is calculated based upon the cost of precious metals at the time they are received by us. We have determined that it is not practicable to assign specific costs to individual units of precious metals and, as such, we relieve our precious metals inventory based on the weighted average cost of the inventory at the time the inventory is used in production. The weighted average method of valuing precious metals does not materially differ from a first in, first out method. We record inventory write downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs and inventory balances. We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in demand for one or more of our products, which may require a write down of inventory that could materially affect operating results. Litigation and Other Contingencies We disclose material contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from managements estimates. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each quarter we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. To the extent a tax position does not meet a more likely than not level of certainty, no benefit is recognized in the financial statements. If a position meets the 46 Table of Contents more likely than not level of certainty, it is recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized on liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions and are recorded in our provision for income taxes. The actual liability for unrealized tax benefit in any such contingency may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits or potentially adjust previously recorded liabilities for unrealized tax benefits and materially affect our operating results. Stock Based Compensation We account for all stock based compensation at fair value. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The fair values of all stock options granted are estimated using a binomial model, and the fair values of all Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) purchase rights are estimated using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial and the Black Scholes Merton models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. We are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. In February 2008, FASB issued ASC 820 10 65 1, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Transition and Open Effective Date Information, which delayed the effective date of ASC 820 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods within those years, which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our adoption of the provisions of ASC 820 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. ASC 805 also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. ASC 805 applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010. ASC 805 impacted our consolidated financial statements for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. For business combinations in which the acquisition date was before the adoption date, the provision of ASC 805 requires changes in the amount of income tax uncertainties to be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the accounting for prior business combinations. Our adoption of ASC 805 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued ASC 350 30 65 1, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill Transition and Open Effective Date Information (ASC 350 30 65 1), which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. ASC 350 30 65 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which for us was the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Our adoption of ASC 350 30 65 1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (ASU 2009 13), and ASU 2009 14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (ASU 2009 14). ASU 2009 13 amends the revenue guidance under Subtopic 605 25, Multiple Element Arrangements, and addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration shall be measured and allocated to the separate units of 47 Table of Contents accounting in the arrangement. ASU 2009 14 excludes tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of Subtopic 985 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2009 13 and ASU 2009 14 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Disclosure About Foreign Currency Risk Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars, some transactions are based in various foreign currencies. We purchase short term, foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on certain underlying assets, revenue, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months. We do not purchase forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to the Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. Euro and British Pound Sterling contracts are designated as fair value hedges. Thai Baht contracts are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges. See Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. As of July 2, 2010, we had outstanding the following purchased foreign exchange contracts (in millions, except weighted average contract rate): Contract Weighted Average Unrealized Amount Contract Rate* Gain Foreign exchange contracts: Thai Baht cash flow hedges $ 789 32.78 $ 5 Thai Baht fair value hedges $ 66 32.43 Malaysian Ringgit cash flow hedges $ 265 3.36 6 Euro fair value hedges $ 8 0.80 British Pound Sterling fair value hedges $ 6 0.66 * Expressed in units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, total net realized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements. Disclosure About Other Market Risks Variable Interest Rate Risk Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of WDTI, either (a) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for Eurodollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs (the Eurocurrency Rate); or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (ii) the prime rate as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Base Rate); in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility ranges from 1.25% to 1.50% with respect to borrowings at the Eurocurrency Rate and 0.0% to 0.125% with respect to borrowings at the Base Rate. The applicable margins for borrowings under the Credit Facility are determined based upon a leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis. If the federal funds rate, prime rate or LIBOR rate increases, our interest payments could also increase. A one percent increase in the variable rate of interest on the Credit Facility would increase interest expense by approximately $4 million annually. 48 Table of Contents
