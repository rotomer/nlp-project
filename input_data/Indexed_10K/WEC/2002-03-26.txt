ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment, a non utility energy segment and a manufacturing segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms "Wisconsin Energy" or the "Company" refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries. The utility energy segment, comprised of Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric"), Wisconsin Gas Company ("Wisconsin Gas") and Edison Sault Electric Company ("Edison Sault"), is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The non utility energy segment, primarily comprised of Wisvest Corporation ("Wisvest") and W.E. Power, LLC ("W.E. Power"), is principally engaged in independent electric power development and production. The manufacturing segment consists of companies which manufacture pumps as well as fluid processing and pump filtration equipment. In addition, Wisconsin Energy has several other subsidiaries, the primary two of which are engaged in the development and marketing of recycling technologies ("Minergy") and in the development of, and investment in real estate ("Wispark"). Acquisition of WICOR, Inc.: On April 26, 2000, Wisconsin Energy acquired WICOR, Inc. ("WICOR"). WICOR is the parent of Wisconsin Gas, the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, and of WICOR Industries, Inc. ("WICOR Industries"), an intermediate holding company which owns several manufacturers of pumps as well as fluid processing and pump filtration equipment. This business combination was accounted for as a purchase and, therefore, is reflected prospectively in Wisconsin Energys consolidated financial statements from and after the date of the acquisition. Cautionary Factors: A number of forward looking statements are included in this document. When used, the terms "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "objective," "plan," "possible," "potential," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are described, including the factors mentioned throughout this document and below in " Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources." CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities The Company seeks to increase shareholder value by leveraging on the core competencies within its business segments. Wisconsin Energys key corporate strategy is Power the Future which was announced in September 2000. This strategy is designed to increase the electric generating capacity in the state of Wisconsin while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It also is designed to improve the delivery of energy within the Companys distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands. The Power the Future strategy, which is discussed further below, is expected to have a significant impact on the Companys utility and non utility energy segments. Utility Energy Segment: This segment is realizing operating efficiencies through the combination of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. These operating efficiencies should increase customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. In connection with the Power the Future strategy, over the next decade, this segment is planning to invest approximately $2.7 billion to improve the existing energy distribution system and approximately $1.3 billion to upgrade existing electric generating assets. This segment also plans to invest approximately $100 million over the next three years to improve the availability of natural gas supplies to the state of Wisconsin. Non Utility Energy Segment: Subject to approval of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW"), this segment will primarily focus on improving the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. W.E. Power has been formed to own and construct the new generation assets under the Power the Future strategy. The majority of Wisvests assets are being divested in order to direct the capital and management attention to Power the Future. Manufacturing Segment: This segment continues to build on the strong name recognition and customer relationships that were developed under WICOR. This segment intends to continue its growth through international expansion, acquiring value adding businesses, capturing cost efficiencies, implementing operating process improvements, and increasing sales through new product introductions and expanded market share. Power the Future Strategy: In late February 2001, Wisconsin Energy announced enhancements to a 10 year, $7 billion strategy, originally proposed in September 2000, to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. This Power the Future strategy is intended to meet the growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. According to a report issued in June 2001, by the Wisconsin Governors Office, demand for electricity in the state of Wisconsin is currently expected to outstrip supply by 7,220 megawatts by the year 2016. Power the Future would add new coal and natural gas capacity to the states power portfolio and would allow Wisconsin Electric to roughly maintain its current fuel mix. As part of its Power the Future strategy, Wisconsin Energy plans to make the following investments over the next decade: Approximately $3 billion in 2,800 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity; Approximately $1.3 billion in upgrades to existing electric generating assets; and Approximately $2.7 billion in new and existing energy distribution system assets. In November 2001, Wisconsin Energy created a new non utility energy subsidiary, W.E. Power, that would construct and own the new generating capacity. Under the enhanced Power the Future strategy, Wisconsin Electric, subject to PSCW approval, would lease each new facility and would operate and maintain the new plants as part of these 20 to 25 year lease agreements. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric would have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or, depending on tax considerations at that time, the subsidiary could choose to extend the lease. Smaller investor owned or municipal utilities, cooperatives and power marketing associations would have the opportunity to participate in the project, including expanding or extending wholesale power purchases from Wisconsin Electric as a result of the additional electric generating capacity included in the proposal. Implementation of the Power the Future strategy is subject to a number of regulatory approvals. In late February 2001, Wisconsin Energy made preliminary filings for its enhanced Power the Future proposal with the PSCW. Subsequently, the state legislature amended several laws, making changes which are critical to the implementation of Power the Future. On October 16, 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with Power the Future and for the Company to incur the associated pre certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review and must be approved by the PSCW in order to be recovered. The PSCW also ruled that such expenses fall within the reliability "carve out" provisions contained in the PSCWs order approving the merger of WICOR and Wisconsin Energy, allowing the Company to seek recovery of such expenses. Wisconsin Energy anticipates obtaining the capital necessary to finance and execute this strategy from a combination of internal and external sources. For further information concerning the Power the Future strategy, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Divestiture of Non Core Assets The Power the Future strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily include non utility generation assets located outside of the Midwest and a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio. During 2000 and 2001, the Company has received total proceeds of almost $700 million from the divestiture of non core assets. Utility Energy Segment: During 2000, Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault agreed to join American Transmission Company LLC ("ATC") by transferring their electric utility transmission assets to ATC in exchange for equity interests in the new company. Transfer of these electric transmission assets, with a net book value of approximately $254.9 million, became effective on January 1, 2001. During 2001, ATC issued debt and distributed $119.8 million of cash back to Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault as a partial return of their original equity contribution. Joining ATC is consistent with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions Order No. 2000, designed to foster competition, efficiency and reliability in the electric industry. The Company anticipates that the transfer of its electric transmission assets to ATC will be earnings neutral subject to approval of transmission cost rate recovery requests made with the PSCW and the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") during 2001. However, the asset transfer has changed where transmission related activities are reflected on the income statement. Prior to the asset transfer, transmission related costs were reflected in Other Operation and Maintenance expense, Depreciation expense and Financing Costs (for interest expense). Following transfer of the transmission assets, the Company reports fees paid to ATC for electric transmission service in Other Operation and Maintenance expense and recognizes an equity interest in ATCs reported earnings in Other Income (Deductions), Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates. See "Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters" below for information related to recovery of the Companys transmission costs. Non Utility Energy Segment: During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold FieldTech, Inc. and Wisvests interest in Blythe Energy, LLC, an independent power production project in the state of California, in separate transactions. Wisconsin Energy realized after tax gains of approximately $16.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share as a result of the sales of FieldTech and Blythe. During April 2001, the operations of WICOR Energy Services Company were merged into Kaztex Energy Management, Inc., an unconsolidated affiliate of Wisconsin Energy. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the operations of Griffin Energy Marketing, L.L.C., a division of Wisvest, were halted, ending electric marketing activities by the non utility energy segment. Griffins activities had been winding down during 2001 as it closed out previously negotiated transactions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The Companys adjusted earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $2.04 per share, an increase of $0.53 per share when compared to 2000 adjusted earnings. This increase reflected higher revenues and improved electric margins within the utility energy segment, improved earnings from Wisvest, stable manufacturing earnings in a soft economy, and the favorable impact of the Companys share repurchase program. Including non recurring gains and charges and the impacts of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, reported earnings for 2001 were $1.86 per share, or a $0.59 per share increase when compared to reported earnings for 2000. The following table compares Wisconsin Energys diluted earnings per share by business segment for 2001 and 1999 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Pro forma Actual Diluted Earnings Per Share 2001 2000 (a) 2000 1999 Utility Energy Segment $2.38 $2.00 $1.82 $1.94 Non Utility Energy Segment 0.12 0.01 0.02 Manufacturing Segment 0.25 0.24 0.18 Other and Merger related Costs (b) (0.71) (0.73) (0.50) (0.08) Adjusted Earnings 2.04 1.51 1.51 1.88 Gains/(Losses) on Investments, Net (c) (0.07) 0.45 0.45 Non Recurring Charges (d) (0.69) (0.69) (0.09) SFAS 133 Charges, Net (e) (0.11) Net Earnings $1.86 $1.27 $1.27 $1.79 (a) Pro forma assumes that the WICOR acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2000 and includes estimated merger related costs from January through April 2000.

(e) Includes $0.09 per share cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS 133 offset by $0.20 per share of SFAS 133 charges. An analysis of contributions to earnings by segment follows. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS Utility net earnings during 2001 increased by $114.4 million to $274.4 million compared to reported 2000 earnings. The primary causes for the growth in utility earnings were $90.0 million attributable to price increases to recover higher fuel, purchased power and other operating costs from the electric business, a $24.5 million increase attributable to Wisconsin Gas operations as a result of the seasonality of the gas heating business, the timing of the acquisition of Wisconsin Gas as part of the acquisition of WICOR in April 2000 and $10.5 million of interest income accrued on the deposit tendered in the Giddings & Lewis, Inc./City of West Allis lawsuit. Utility net earnings during 2001 increased by $100.0 million when compared to 2000 pro forma earnings. The primary causes for this increase were $65.8 million attributable to higher electric utility gross margins and $10.5 million of interest income accrued on the deposit in the Giddings & Lewis, Inc./City of West Allis lawsuit offset partially by a decrease of $15.6 million of gas utility gross margins. Utility net earnings during 2000 decreased by $56.0 million when compared to 1999 reflecting $45.9 million of non recurring charges primarily associated with the WICOR merger, increased fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric and cooler than normal summer weather. The following table summarizes the utility energy segments earnings during 2001 and 1999 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Pro forma Actual Utility Energy Segment 2001 2000 (a) 2000 (b) 1999 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric Utility $1,867.4 $1,797.8 $1,797.8 $1,722.1 Gas Utility 1,074.5 952.3 736.3 306.8 Other Utility 22.9 22.9 22.6 21.3 Total Operating Revenues 2,964.8 2,773.0 2,556.7 2,050.2 Fuel and Purchased Power 517.3 513.5 513.5 458.9 Cost of Gas Sold 751.6 613.8 486.7 174.0 Gross Margin 1,695.9 1,645.7 1,556.5 1,417.3 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 765.5 741.6 705.2 656.6 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 308.6 309.7 297.5 237.2 Property and Revenue Taxes 75.4 71.1 70.9 68.3 Operating Income 546.4 523.3 482.9 455.2 Other Income 38.8 6.3 7.1 12.5 Financing Costs 127.4 133.9 129.5 115.5 Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes 457.8 395.7 360.5 352.2 Income Taxes 177.3 153.5 140.3 125.4 Adjusted Earnings Before WICOR Merger Costs 280.5 242.2 220.2 226.8 WICOR Merger Costs, After Tax (c) 4.9 21.8 14.3 Adjusted Earnings (d) $275.6 $220.4 $205.9 $226.8 Net Earnings $274.4 $174.4 $160.0 $216.0 (a) Includes Wisconsin Gas as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect the operations of Wisconsin Gas subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. (c) Merger related costs represent WICOR acquisition purchase accounting entries, primarily goodwill amortization and interest expense. (d) During 2001, adjusted earnings exclude a net loss on investments of $1.2 million. During 2000, adjusted earnings exclude $45.9 million of net non recurring charges primarily associated with the WICOR merger. During 1999, adjusted earnings exclude a net one time charge of $10.8 million related to the settlement of litigation. Electric Utility Revenues, Gross Margins and Sales During 2001, Wisconsin Energys total electric utility operating revenues increased by $69.6 million or 3.9% compared with 2000. Wisconsin Energy attributes this growth mostly to incremental rate increases in effect during 2001 related to higher fuel, purchased power and other operating costs. For additional information concerning these rate increases, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Higher electric cooling load during the summer of 2001 caused by a return to normal summer weather also contributed to the growth in electric operating revenues. These revenue increases were partially offset by a reduction in total electric sales during 2001 due in large part to a softening economy in the region. Purchased power expenses increased by $20.3 million or 11.2% during 2001 primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, as a result of higher demand costs during 2001 associated with purchased power contracts. A $16.5 million or 5.1% decline in fuel costs during 2001, primarily driven by a change in the Companys electric supply mix to lower cost nuclear generation and by an overall reduction in demand for electric energy during 2001, resulted in a net increase in fuel and purchased power expenses of $3.8 million or 0.7% when compared with 2000. Due to the 3.9% increase in operating revenues partially offset by the slightly higher fuel and purchased power costs, electric gross margin (total electric utility operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses) grew by $65.8 million or 5.1% during 2001 when compared with 2000. During 2000, Wisconsin Energys total electric utility operating revenues increased by $75.7 million or 4.4% compared with 1999 primarily due to higher electric energy sales during 2000 and to electric rate increases at Wisconsin Electric that became effective in early April 2000 and on August 30, 2000, respectively. For additional information concerning these rate increases, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $54.5 million or 12.0% during 2000 reflecting increased generation and significantly higher natural gas prices. Purchased power expenses also grew due to higher demand costs during 2000 associated with purchased power contracts. To a certain extent, Wisconsin Energy was able to limit the increase in fuel and purchased power costs during 2000 by changing its electric supply mix away from higher cost natural gas fired generation and power purchases to lower cost nuclear and coal fired generation. The following table compares Wisconsin Energys electric utility operating revenues and its gross margin during 2001 with similar information for 2000 and 1999. Electric Revenues and Gross Margin Megawatt Hour Sales Electric Utility Operations 2001 2000 1999 2001 2000 1999 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands) Operating Revenues Residential $654.5 $606.7 $584.3 7,773.4 7,633.2 7,503.1 Small Commercial/Industrial 592.9 550.0 524.9 8,595.4 8,524.7 8,257.7 Large Commercial/Industrial 479.7 472.8 459.4 11,177.6 11,824.0 11,542.8 Other Retail/Municipal 70.6 64.7 56.7 1,828.6 1,755.8 1,531.4 Resale Utilities 56.8 79.1 74.7 1,687.6 2,304.7 2,422.1 Other Operating Revenues 12.9 24.5 22.1 Total Operating Revenues 1,867.4 1,797.8 1,722.1 31,062.6 32,042.4 31,257.1 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 315.0 331.5 299.1 Purchased Power 202.3 182.0 153.7 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 517.3 513.5 452.8 Gross Margin $1,350.1 $1,284.3 $1,269.3 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,821 Normal) 6,338 6,716 6,318 Cooling (685 Normal) 711 566 753 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. During 2001, total electric sales fell by 3.1% compared with 2000, reflecting a softening economy that has especially affected large commercial and industrial customers such as Wisconsin Electrics largest retail customers, two iron ore mines. Sales to these mines decreased by 17.7% during 2001, with one of the mines currently idle pending a production decision by its owners. Excluding the two mines, total electric sales decreased 1.8% during 2001 and sales to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers decreased by 2.3% when compared with 2000. Due to warmer weather during the summer of 2001, a 1.8% increase in sales to residential customers, who are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins than other customer classes, partially offset the effects of the soft economy on electric sales during 2001. As measured by cooling degree days, 2001 was 25.6% warmer than 2000 and 3.8% warmer than normal. Sales for resale to other utilities, the Resale Utilities customer class, declined 26.8 % during 2001 primarily as a result of a reduced demand for wholesale power. During 2000, total electric energy sales increased by 2.5% compared with 1999, mostly reflecting growth in the average number of residential, small commercial/industrial and other retail/municipal customers and a 13.1% increase in sales to the iron ore mines noted above. Excluding these mines, total electric sales increased by 1.7% and sales to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers were unchanged between the comparative periods. Growth in the average number of customers partially offset the effects of cooler weather during the 2000 cooling season on total electric energy sales and on operating revenues. As measured by cooling degree days, 2000 was 24.8% cooler than 1999 and 17.4% cooler than normal. Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries The following table compares Wisconsin Energys gas utility operating revenues and its gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2001 and 1999 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Pro forma Actual Gas Utility Operations 2001 2000 (a) 2000 (b) 1999 (Millions of Dollars) Gas Operating Revenues $1,074.5 $952.3 $736.3 $306.8 Cost of Gas Sold 751.6 613.8 486.7 174.0 Gross Margin $322.9 $338.5 $249.6 $132.8 (a) Wisconsin Energys gas utility information reflects the operations of Wisconsin Gas subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. For further information concerning gas utility operations during the comparative periods, see "Pro Forma Gas Utility Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries" below. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect the operations of Wisconsin Gas subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. During 2001, Wisconsin Energys gas operating revenues increased by $122.2 million or 12.8% when compared with 2000 pro forma revenues. This increase reflected a $137.8 million increase due to increases in the cost of gas sold offset in part by warmer weather which reduced volumes sold. During 2000, Wisconsin Energys total gas utility operating revenues increased by $429.5 million or 140.0% compared with the same period during 1999. Gross margin on gas utility operating revenues increased by $116.8 million or 88.0%. Of these changes, $336.7 million of the increase in total gas utility operating revenues and $109.3 million of the increase in gross margin were attributable to the addition of Wisconsin Gas to the Company in April 2000. Pro Forma Gas Utility Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries The following table compares pro forma gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries during 2001, 2000 and 1999 as if Wisconsin Gas had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 1999. Gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gas cost recovery mechanisms that do not impact gross margin. Pro Forma Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2001 2000 (a) 1999 (a) 2001 2000 (a) 1999 (a) (Millions of Dollars) (Millions) Customer Class Residential $209.0 $216.0 $207.0 756.3 803.8 769.4 Commercial/Industrial 62.3 64.4 61.6 427.7 462.1 445.8 Interruptible 2.0 2.5 3.9 25.8 35.2 45.3 Total Retail Gas Gross Margin 273.3 282.9 272.5 1,209.8 1,301.1 1,260.5 Transported Gas 41.4 47.0 41.2 787.4 897.1 903.7 Other Operating 8.2 8.6 8.1 Total Operating Gross Margin $322.9 $338.5 $321.8 1,997.2 2,198.2 2,164.2 Weather Degree Days (b) Heating (6,821 Normal) 6,338 6,716 6,318 (a) Information for the years 2000 and 1999 include Wisconsin Gas as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 1999. (b) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. Gas margins totaled $322.9 million in 2001, or a $15.6 million decline from 2000 pro forma amounts. This decline was directly related to warmer winter weather which reduced the heating load. Total therm deliveries of natural gas decreased by 9.1% during 2001, but varied within customer classes. Volume deliveries for the residential and commercial/industrial customer classes decreased by 5.9% and 7.4%, respectively, reflecting warmer weather. Residential and commercial customers are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins per therm than other customers. Transportation volumes were 12.2% lower than the prior year reflecting fuel switching to lower cost fuel options and a softening economy. Other Utility Segment Items Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $23.9 million during 2001 when compared with 2000 pro forma amounts. The most significant change in other operation and maintenance expenses between the comparative periods resulted from $44.9 million of higher electric transmission expenses caused by a change in how electric transmission costs are recorded as a result of the transfer of Wisconsin Electrics and Edison Saults electric transmission assets to ATC on January 1, 2001. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs as a result of the WICOR merger, which led to the consolidation of common operating and support areas. The most significant change in other operation and maintenance expenses between 2000 and 1999 resulted from $52.7 million of non recurring charges during 2000 at Wisconsin Electric associated with the WICOR merger including severance, benefits and other items. Increased other operation and maintenance expenses during 2000, excluding Wisconsin Gas, were also attributable to $14.8 million of higher non fuel fossil generation expenses and $9.0 million of higher electric distribution expenses offset in part by an $8.8 million decline in nuclear non fuel expenses and a $9.9 million decline in customer service expenses. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expenses: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses were $1.1 million lower during 2001 compared with 2000 pro forma. The transfer of electric transmission assets to the ATC resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense, which was partially offset by increased capital asset additions for electric generation and for electric and gas distribution systems. Excluding Wisconsin Gas, depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses were $39.0 million higher during 2000 compared with 1999. Pursuant to a 1998 rate order for the 1998/1999 test year, Wisconsin Electric was amortizing pre 1991 contributions in aid of construction. This amortization, which was completed as of December 31, 1999, had the effect of reducing depreciation expense by $22.8 million in 2000 compared to 1999. Higher average depreciable property during 2000 also contributed to an increase in depreciation expense. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS As part of its ongoing efforts to divest non core assets, the Company significantly reduced certain of Wisvests operations during 2001. The Company is evaluating proposals to sell two fossil fueled power plants in the state of Connecticut owned by Wisvest Connecticut, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisvest. The ultimate timing, proceeds and any gain or loss as a result of the asset sale is dependent upon many factors, including, but not limited to the independent power markets, forward electric price curves, the ability of independent power producers to obtain financing and general economic conditions. The following table compares the non utility energy segments earnings during 2001 and 1999 with similar actual and pro forma information for 2000. In addition, the table summarizes electric megawatt hour sales by Wisvest Connecticuts power plants as well as electric and natural gas sales from non utility energy marketing, trading and services operations during the comparative periods.

(b) Reflect the operations of WICOR Energy Services and FieldTech, subsidiaries of WICOR, subsequent to the merger on April 26, 2000. During April 2001, the operations of WICOR Energy Services were merged into an unconsolidated affiliate of Wisconsin Energy, ending direct gas marketing activities by the non utility energy segment. In May 2001, FieldTech was sold to an unrelated third party. (c) Includes the operations of Wisvest Connecticut subsequent to their acquisition in April 1999. (d) Adjusted earnings during 2001 exclude $16.5 million of net gains on the sale of assets partially offset by $12.6 million of net charges related to SFAS 133. Adjusted earnings during 2000 exclude $54.6 million of net gains on the sale of assets partially offset by $16.1 million of net non recurring charges relating to severance costs associated with the divestiture of non core businesses and to write downs associated with certain investments. (e) During the fourth quarter of 2001, the operations of Griffin Energy Marketing, L.L.C., a division of Wisvest, were halted, ending electric marketing activities by the non utility energy segment. Griffins activities wound down throughout 2001 as it closed out previously negotiated transactions. During 2001, adjusted earnings of the non utility energy segment grew by $13.9 million when compared with 2000 on an actual basis or by $14.3 million when compared with 2000 on a pro forma basis. Adjusted earnings during 2001 exclude $16.5 million of net gains on the sale of assets offset in part by net charges of $12.6 million as a result of the adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001 and subsequent valuation charges from applying SFAS 133 during the year. Adjusted earnings during 2000 exclude $54.6 million of net gains on the sale of assets offset in part by $16.1 million of after tax non recurring charges during the fourth quarter of 2000 relating to severance costs associated with the divestiture of non core businesses and for write downs associated with certain investments. Adjusted earnings increased during 2001 primarily due to improved operating results from Wisvest Connecticuts two power plants offset in part by start up costs associated with W.E. Power. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Wisvest Connecticut assets are accounted for as assets held for sale. Under this accounting, no depreciation expense of long lived assets is reported. This change in accounting benefited the non utility energy segment by approximately $0.05 per share when compared to 2000. During 2001, both of Wisvest Connecticuts plants operated for the full year. During 2000, one of Wisvest Connecticuts plants experienced an extended outage which increased purchased power and maintenance costs. During 1999, the Company did not operate Wisvest Connecticuts two plants until April, when the plants were originally acquired. MANUFACTURING SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS During 2001, the manufacturing segment contributed $29.1 million to earnings before merger costs, which was slightly better than the prior year pro forma amounts. Including WICOR merger costs, net income was $9.7 million, or $1.7 million better than 2000 pro forma amounts. Prior to the WICOR acquisition, Wisconsin Energy did not have a manufacturing segment. The following table summarizes the manufacturing segments earnings during 2001with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Pro forma Actual Manufacturing Segment 2001 2000 (a) 2000 (b) (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Domestic $444.9 $433.9 $294.1 International 140.2 141.3 88.1 Total Operating Revenues 585.1 575.2 382.2 Cost of Goods Sold 423.6 414.1 270.8 Gross Margin 161.5 161.1 111.4 Other Operating Expenses 107.2 106.8 71.0 Operating Income 54.3 54.3 40.4 Other Income (Deductions) 0.3 (0.5) (0.8) Financing Costs 7.1 6.9 4.3 Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes 47.5 46.9 35.3 Income Taxes 18.4 18.0 13.8 Adjusted Earnings Before WICOR merger costs 29.1 28.9 21.5 WICOR merger costs, after tax (c) 19.4 20.9 14.0 Net Earnings $9.7 $8.0 $7.5 (a) Includes operations of the manufacturing segment as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect operations of the manufacturing segment subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. (c) Merger related costs represent WICOR acquisition purchase accounting entries, primarily goodwill amortization and interest expense. Operating revenues were up by $9.9 million during 2001 as compared to pro forma operating revenues in 2000 primarily due to acquisitions, offset partially by the effects of a decline in the economy on base business sales and unfavorable foreign currency translations. The manufacturing segments modest decline reflects the steadiness and diversification of the markets it serves. For the year, operating income of $54.3 million was essentially flat compared with 2000 on a pro forma basis. In spite of additional operations due to the acquisitions, other operating expenses increased slightly reflecting aggressive cost reduction initiatives implemented early in the year. The manufacturing segments results for 2000 were impacted by a series of expenses associated with the defense of intellectual property rights, development of a new beverage dispensing technology and the integration of an acquisition. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS During 2001, the Company incurred $73.0 million of charges, which are recorded as "Other" in Other Income and Deductions. These charges primarily represented $38.5 million of SFAS 133 charges related to the decline in oil prices and $37.6 million in write downs in the Witech venture capital portfolio. During 2000, the Company incurred $39.3 million of charges which are recorded in "Other" in Other Income and Deductions. These charges primarily represented write downs of non core assets. CONSOLIDATED FINANCING COSTS During 2001, total financing costs were $246.6 million, up slightly from 2000 amounts but mitigated by the decline in short term interest rates in 2001. During 2000, financing costs were $244.8 million, or $94.3 million higher than 1999. The 2000 financing costs were influenced by the April 2000 acquisition of WICOR, which resulted in almost $1.5 billion of additional debt for the Company. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate was 41.9%, 44.9%, and 34.7% for the three years ending December 31, 2001, respectively. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflects the amortization of the WICOR goodwill which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The 2000 effective income tax rate includes the amortization of WICOR goodwill for eight months, as well as the impact of unrealized capital losses. The 1999 effective income tax rate does not include WICOR goodwill amortization, and it includes a regulatory adjustment for the accounting for contributions in aid of construction which reduced the effective tax rate by 2.5%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes Wisconsin Energys cash flows during 2001, 2000 and 1999: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2001 2000 (a) 1999 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $555.8 $461.0 $306.9 Investing Activities ($464.3) ($1,520.5) ($888.8) Financing Activities ($85.0) $1,026.5 $638.8 (a) Includes the operations of the WICOR subsidiaries subsequent to the merger on April 26, 2000. Operating Activities During 2001, cash flow from operations increased to $555.8 million, or a $94.8 million improvement over 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income and higher non cash charges. During 2000, cash flow from operations increased by $154.1 million over 1999 due primarily to increased non cash charges and a $110 million payment made in 1999 related to litigation. This payment was returned to the Company with interest in early 2002. Investing Activities During 2001, the Company spent $672.5 million on capital expenditures, which was a $61.5 million increase over 2000. The largest increase in capital expenditures came within the utility energy segment for electric and gas distribution assets. During 2001, the Companys manufacturing segment also made acquisitions totaling $35.7 million. In 2000, the Company completed the WICOR acquisition at a purchase price of $1.2 billion, as well as a small manufacturing acquisition. These acquisitions were initially financed with short term commercial paper. In 2001, the Company continued its strategy of divesting non core assets. During 2001, the Company received proceeds from asset divestitures of $294.4 million related to the transfer of electric transmission assets to ATC and the successful sale of the Wisvest Blythe project and FieldTech. During 2000, the Company received proceeds from asset sales of approximately $408.4 million which primarily reflects the sale of Wisvests investment in SkyGen, an independent power producer. The SkyGen sale resulted in a gain of $0.45 per share in 2000. Financing Activities In September 2000, the Company initiated a share repurchase program. Under the program, the Company repurchased and retired 10.9 million shares through December 31, 2001 at a cost of $234.5 million. It is expected that this program will continue during 2002. In September 2000, the Company also announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend from $0.39 per share to $0.20 per share. This action reduced the dividends paid in 2001 as compared to 2000 and also reduced the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the dividend reinvestment program. During 2001, the Company refinanced approximately $1.3 billion of commercial paper through the issuance of intermediate term senior notes. In January 2002, the Company redeemed $100 million of 8 3/8% long term debt and $3.4 million of 9 1/8% long term debt. These redemptions were financed with short term commercial paper bearing rates of approximately 2%. The 2002 redemptions are expected to have an initial cost of $0.03 per share associated with the redemption premium; however, it is expected that the current short term rates will result in reduced interest costs during 2002. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS As Wisconsin Energy continues to implement its strategy of leveraging on the core competencies of its business segments and building financial strength, Wisconsin Energy expects to continue to divest of non core assets, invest in core assets, buy back common stock and pay down debt. Capital Resources The Company anticipates meeting its capital requirements during 2002 primarily through internally generated funds and net proceeds as a result of asset sales. Beyond 2002, Wisconsin Energy anticipates meeting its capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, through the issuance of debt securities. The Company has access to the capital markets and has been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet its capital requirements. Wisconsin Energys ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to the Companys overall strategic plan. Wisconsin Energy believes that it has adequate capacity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash. On December 31, 2001, Wisconsin Energy had $945 million of total available unused short term borrowing capacity on a consolidated basis under existing commercial paper programs and other short term borrowing arrangements. On that date, Wisconsin Energy had $1.7 billion of available unused lines of bank credit on a consolidated basis to support its outstanding commercial paper program and other short term borrowing arrangements. The following table shows Wisconsin Energys consolidated capitalization structure at December 31: Capitalization Structure 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $2,056.1 31.4% $2,016.8 31.4% Preferred Stock 30.4 0.5% 30.4 0.5% Trust Preferred Securities 200.0 3.0% 200.0 3.1% Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 3,721.6 56.7% 2,788.1 43.4% Short Term Debt 550.4 8.4% 1,386.1 21.6% Total $6,558.5 100.0% $6,421.4 100.0% As described in "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of Wisconsin Energys subsidiaries to transfer funds to Wisconsin Energy. The Company does not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on its operations or ability to meet its cash obligations. Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the current ratings of the debt securities of Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries by Standard & Poors Corporation ("S&P"), Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys") and Fitch. Commercial paper of WICOR Industries is unrated. S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A2 A+ Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 1 P 1 F1+ Secured Senior Debt A Aa2 AA Unsecured Debt A Aa3 AA Preferred Stock BBB+ A2 AA Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 1 P 1 F1+ Unsecured Senior Debt A Aa2 AA Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt A A2 A+ WEC Capital Trust I Trust Preferred Securities BBB A3 A S&Ps and Moodys current outlook for Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries is stable while Fitch currently maintains a negative outlook for Wisconsin Energy Corporation and for Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation. Fitchs outlook for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas is currently stable. Wisconsin Energy believes these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Capital Requirements Total capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel, are currently estimated to be $661 million during 2002 attributable to the following operating segments: Estimated Actual Capital Expenditures 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $466 $428.7 Non Utility Energy Power the Future 44 6.1 Other 23 121.6 Manufacturing 20 27.1 Other 108 89.0 Total $661 $672.5 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards or electric reliability initiatives that impact the Companys utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. The utility energy segment currently expects capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel and expenditures for new generating capacity contained in the Power the Future strategy described below, to be between $400 million and $500 million per year during the next five years. Capital requirements over the next decade for Power the Future include approximately $3.0 billion to construct 2,800 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity, approximately $1.3 billion to upgrade existing electric generating assets and approximately $2.7 billion for energy distribution system upgrades. The capital required to support the $3.0 billion of new generation over the next 10 years is expected to come from a combination of internal and external sources. With the dividend reduction that began in 2001, the Company is expected to retain almost $90 million per year of additional cash flows, which will provide substantial funding for new generation. The Company is also divesting non utility assets which will provide additional cash. Subject to PSCW approval, the new generating plants will be constructed by W.E. Power, a non utility subsidiary, and leased to the utility under 20 25 year lease agreements. It is expected that the utility will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. It is anticipated that the utility will need external financing as the plants are constructed, but the cash flows from the lease payments, the asset divestitures and the additional cash retained within the Company as a result of the dividend reduction are expected to eliminate the need for additional equ ity financing. Wisconsin Energy is a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of its normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. The Companys estimated maximum exposure under such agreements is approximately $106 million as of December 31, 2001. However, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements. The Company has the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Less than 1 yr 2 5 years After 5 years Total (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt (b) $456.9 $1,215.1 $1,880.6 $3,552.6 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 56.7 149.6 469.9 676.2 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 7.4 20.7 14.8 42.9 Unconditional Purchase Obligations (e) 9.6 38.4 48.0 Other Long Term Obligations (f) 348.1 609.5 357.0 1,314.6 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $878.7 $2,033.3 $2,722.3 $5,634.3 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Principal payments on Long Term Debt of Wisconsin Energy and affiliates (excluding capital lease obligations). (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for nuclear fuel lease and purchase power commitments. (d) Operating Leases Obligations for equipment, vehicles and property for Wisconsin Energy and affiliates. (e) Unconditional Purchase Obligations for information technology and other services for utility operations. (f) Other Long Term Obligations under various contracts of Wisconsin Energy and affiliates for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation, primarily related to utility operations. Obligations for utility operations by Wisconsin Energys utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore generally recoverable from customers. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS The Company is potentially exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of its businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. Such risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: (1) Commodity price risks related to electric generation fuel costs, the market price of electricity and the price of natural gas; (2) Regulatory risk associated with the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs of Wisconsin Electric; (3) Weather fluctuations; (4) Interest rate risks associated with the Companys portfolio of short and long term debt; (5) Marketable securities return risk related to debt and equity investments held in various trust funds; (6) Independent power project risks associated with the divestiture of non utility energy segment assets; (7) Foreign currency exchange rate risks linked to purchases and sales within the manufacturing segment; (8) Economic risks; and (9) Inflationary risks to future results of operations, especially as they relate to expenses associated with employee medical benefit plans and post retirement benefits. Commodity Price Risk: In the normal course of business, the Companys utility and non utility power generation subsidiaries utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of electricity. This is done to effectively manage utilization of their available generating capacity and energy during periods when available power resources are expected to exceed the requirements of their obligations. This practice may also include forward contracts for the purchase of power during periods when the anticipated market price of electric energy is below expected incremental power production costs. The Company manages its fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium, natural gas and fuel oil. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. On a prospective basis, if cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted, subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process noted below. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery of natural gas costs for the gas utility operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For additional information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities gas cost recovery mechanisms, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. At December 31, 2001, the majority of the commodity contracts in the non utility segment are at Wisvest Connecticut. Assuming a 10% price change for fuel oil based upon forward market prices as of December 31, 2001, the Company would record approximately a $12.4 million increase or decrease in pre tax income. Regulatory Recovery Risk: The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in several of its peaker power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants, and the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas in many instances. Wisconsin Electric bears significant regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. As noted above, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity. This clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power, and Wisconsin Electric assumes the risks and benefits of fuel cost variances that are within 3% of the base rate. For 2001 and 2000, actual fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric exceeded base fuel rates by $0.1 million and $25.9 million, respectively. In 2001, the base fuel rates included a fuel surcharge. For 1999, actual Wisconsin Electric fuel and purchased power costs were $1.5 million less than base fuel rates. Weather: The rates of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to the winter heating season. The gas revenues of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are sensitive to the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2001, 2000 and 1999, as measured by degree days, may be found above in "Results of Operations". Temperature can also impact demand for electricity in regions where the Company has invested in non utility energy assets or projects. Interest Rate Risk: The Company, including its affiliates, has various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. Wisconsin Energy also has variable rate long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2001. Borrowing levels under such arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. The Company performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2001 of its outstanding portfolio of $550.4 million short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.09% and $578.0 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.97%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause the Companys annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $5.5 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $5.0 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return Risk: The Company funds its pension, other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market price of the assets in these trust funds can affect future pension, other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Future annuity payments to these trust funds can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. Wisconsin Energy expects that the risk of expense and annuity payment variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by the Companys various utility regulators. The Company is currently operating under a PSCW ordered, qualified five year rate freeze. For further information about the rate freeze, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. At December 31, 2001, the Company held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments. Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,062.7 Nuclear decommissioning trust fund $589.6 Other postretirement benefits trust funds $148.8 The Company manages its fiduciary oversight of the pension and other postretirement plan trust fund investments through a Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. The Company conducts asset/liability studies periodically through an outside investment advisor. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments is also the responsibility of the Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. An asset/liability study is periodically conducted by an outside investment advisor, subject to additional constraints established by the PSCW. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% equities. The allocation to equities is expected to be reduced as the date for decommissioning Point Beach Nuclear Plant approaches in order to increase the probability of sufficient liquidity at the time the funds will be needed. Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ("NEIL"). Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment results and determines the feasibility of granting a distribution to policyholders. Wisconsin Electric has received at least $9.0 million before taxes as its share of distributions in recent years. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs, or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs to Wisconsin Electric. Independent Power Project ("IPP") Market Risk: Prior to the September 2000 Power the Future strategic announcement, the Company made significant commitments to develop, build and own non utility power plants. Subsequent to September 2000, the Company made significant progress in exiting many of these projects, which resulted in gains during 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately $650 million of investments in non utility energy assets. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the IPP market experienced a significant decline driven by several factors, including the softening economy, the financial viability of energy companies with large IPP investments, lower forward electric price curves and a significant tightening of credit to this market. These factors may adversely impact the timing, proceeds and the gain or loss on future sales of non utility energy assets. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: The Company manages foreign currency market risks through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments. The Company uses forward exchange contracts and other activities to hedge the U.S. dollar value resulting from anticipated foreign currency transactions. The notional amount of these contracts is not significant to the Company. The Company generally uses natural hedges to minimize exposures to the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys net exposure at December 31, 2001 was immaterial. Economic Risk. The Company is exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy for the utility energy segment and worldwide economic trends for the manufacturing segment. The Company uses diversification in its portfolio of businesses to reduce its exposure to economic fluctuations. Inflationary Risk: The Company continues to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the impacts on the Companys medical and post retirement benefit plans, the Company has expectations of low to moderate inflation. Wisconsin Energy does not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on its future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see "Cautionary Factors" below. RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission regulates retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Wisconsin Jurisdiction WICOR Merger Order: As a condition of its March 2000 approval of the WICOR acquisition, the PSCW ordered a five year rate restriction period in effect freezing electric and natural gas rates for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas effective January 1, 2001. The Company may seek biennial rate reviews during the five year rate restriction period limited to "carve out" changes in revenue requirements as a result of: Governmental mandates; Abnormal levels of capital additions required to maintain or improve reliable electric service; and Major gas lateral projects associated with approved natural gas pipeline construction projects. To the extent that natural gas rates and rules need to be modified during the integration of the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, the Companys total gas revenue requirements are to remain revenue neutral under the merger order. In its order, the PSCW found that electric fuel cost adjustment procedures as well as gas cost recovery mechanisms would not be subject to the five year rate restriction period and that it was reasonable to allow the Company to retain efficiency gains associated with the merger. A full rate review will be required by the PSCW at the end of the five year rate restriction period. Wisconsin Electric Power Company: The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of recent rate changes, primarily in the Wisconsin jurisdiction, authorized by regulatory commissions for Wisconsin Electrics electric, natural gas and steam utilities. Incremental Annualized Authorized Revenue Percent Return on Increase Change Common Effective Service Wisconsin Electric (Decrease) in Rates Equity Date (Millions) (%) (%) Retail gas (a) $3.6 0.9% 12.2% 12/20/01 Fuel electric, WI (b) $20.9 1.4% 5/03/01 Fuel electric, WI (b) $37.8 2.5% 2/09/01 Fuel electric, MI $1.0 2.4% 1/01/01 Retail electric, WI $27.5 1.8% 12.2% 1/01/01 Retail electric, WI (c) $11.3 0.8% 12.2% 8/30/00 Retail gas (c) ($3.6) (0.9)% 12.2% 8/30/00 Retail electric, WI (c) $25.2 1.7% 12.2% 4/11/00 Retail gas (c) $11.6 3.3% 12.2% 4/11/00 Fuel electric, WI ($7.8) (0.5%) 5/01/99 (a) On 11/1/01 the Milwaukee County Circuit Court overturned the PSCWs 8/30/00 final order for natural gas rates and the PSCW reinstated the higher 4/11/00 interim gas rate order, effective 12/20/01. (b) The 2/9/01 order was an interim order that was effective until the 5/3/01 final order was issued by the PSCW. The final 5/3/01 order superceded the 2/9/01 interim order. (c) The 4/11/00 order was an interim order that was effective until the 8/30/00 final order was issued by the PSCW. The retail gas 8/30/00 final order was amended in the 12/20/01 Order. On March 23, 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics request for interim price increases related to the 2000/2001 biennial period, authorizing a $25.2 million (1.7%) increase for electric operations and an $11.6 million (3.3%) increase for gas operations. The interim increase, which was subject to potential refund, became effective April 11, 2000. Rates in the interim order were based upon a 12.2% return on common equity. On August 30, 2000, the PSCW issued its final order in the 2000/2001 pricing proposal. The final order authorized a $36.5 million (2.5%) increase for electric operations (or $11.3 million higher than authorized in the interim order) as well as an $8 million (2.1%) increase for gas operations (or $3.6 million lower than authorized in the interim order). Wisconsin Electric refunded to gas customers revenues that resulted from the difference in gas rates between the interim and final orders. In its August 30, 2000 final order, the PSCW authorized a second $27.5 million (1.8%) increase for electric operations effective January 1, 2001. Rates in the final order were based upon a 12.2% return on common equity. On November 14, 2000, Wisconsin Electric filed a petition for judicial review with the Milwaukee County Circuit Court challenging the PSCWs decision to limit the final gas rate increase to $8.0 million rather than the $11.6 million found reasonable for the interim increase. On November 1, 2001 the Milwaukee County Circuit Court ruled in Wisconsin Electrics favor and remanded it back to the PSCW for action. The PSCW did not challenge the courts decision and authorized the Company to increase natural gas rates by $3.6 million effective December 20, 2001. In its final order related to the 2000/2001 biennial period, the PSCW authorized recovery of revenue requirements for, among other things, electric reliability and safety construction expenditures as well as for nitrogen oxide ("NOx") remediation expenditures. Revenue requirements for electric reliability and safety construction expenditures are subject to refund at the end of 2001 to the extent that actual expenditures are less than forecasted expenditures included in the final order. In March 2000, the PSCW had previously authorized all Wisconsin utilities to depreciate NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period. Due to the uncertainty regarding the level and timing of these expenditures, the PSCW, in its final order, required Wisconsin Electric to establish escrow accounting for revenue requirement components associated with NOx expenditures. Wisconsin Electrics actual NOx remediation expenditures during the 2000/200 1 biennial period resulted in an under spent balance of approximately $8.0 million at the end of 2001 in the NOx escrow account which will need to be addressed in future rate making activities. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: In September 2001, Wisconsin Electric requested that the PSCW approve $58.8 million of annual rate relief to recover costs associated with the formation and operation of ATC, which was designed to enhance access and increase electric system reliability and market efficiency. Wisconsin Electric also is seeking to recover associated incremental transmission costs of the Midwest Independent System Operator, the multi state organization that will monitor and control electric transmission throughout the Midwest. These increased costs are due to the implementation of capital improvement projects that are expected to increase transmission capacity and reliability. The Company anticipates that cost recovery of the transmission related costs under this request and similar requests in the Michigan Jurisdiction will be earnings neutral subject to approval of these requests by the PSCW and MPSC. Wisconsin Gas Company: Wisconsin Gas rates were set within the framework of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism, which was established in 1994 and expired on October 31, 2001. Under this mechanism, Wisconsin Gas has the ability to raise or lower margin rates within a specified range on a quarterly basis. Currently, Wisconsin Gass rates recover $1.5 million per year less than the maximum amount allowed by the PSCWs rate order. The Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism has certain criteria that allow it to be reopened at any time for significant deterioration in safety, failures to meet conservation goals, significant changes in interest rates and "extraordinary items." To date, none of the criteria has been triggered. In its approval of the WICOR acquisition, the PSCW ordered that Wisconsin Gas natural gas rates remain under the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism for the programs duration and remain revenue neutral during the remainder of the five year rate restriction period noted above. Pursuant to that PSCW directive, Wisconsin Gas rates remain at the same levels as were set prior to the expiration of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: As previously reported, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. On December 8, 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application with the PSCW seeking a $51.4 million increase in rates on an expedited basis to recover increased costs of fuel and purchased power in 2001. Wisconsin Electric revised its projected power supply cost shortfall on January 10, 2001 to reflect updated natural gas cost projections for 2001. This update resulted in a request for an additional $11.1 million in 2001, bringing the total requested increase to $62.5 million. Hearings on this matter were held in mid January 2001. On February 9, 2001, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a $37.8 million increase in rates for 2001 power supply costs. Hearings on the final phase of the case were held in late March and early April 2001. The PSCW issued a final order on May 3, 2001, effective immediately, authorizing a total increase in rates of $58.7 million (or an additional $20.9 million over the interim order). Under the fuel rules, Wisconsin Electric would have to refund to customers any over recoveries of fuel costs as a result of the surcharges authorized in 2001. During 2001, the Company did not over recover fuel costs. On June 4, 2001, two consumer advocacy groups petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for review of these decisions of the PSCW authorizing Wisconsin Electric to add a surcharge to its electric rates to recover its expected 2001 power supply costs. The petitioners allege that the PSCW made various material errors of law and procedure as a result of which the Court should set aside both the interim and final orders and remand the case to the PSCW. The matter is pending. Wisconsin Electric intends to vigorously defend the PSCWs orders and believes the Court will affirm the PSCWs actions. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: As a result of the acquisition of WICOR by Wisconsin Energy, the PSCW required similar gas cost recovery mechanisms ("GCRM") for the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and for Wisconsin Gas. In recent years, Wisconsin Electric has operated under a modified dollar for dollar GCRM, which included after the fact prudence reviews by the PSCW, while the Wisconsin Gas GCRM included an incentive mechanism that provides an opportunity for Wisconsin Gas to increase or decrease earnings within certain limited ranges as a result of gas acquisition activities and transportation costs. For both companies, the majority of gas costs are passed through to customers under their existing gas cost recovery mechanisms. In February 2001, the PSCW issued an order to Wisconsin Electric and to Wisconsin Gas authorizing a similar GCRM for each company. These new GCRMs, which were effective April 1, 2001, are similar to the existing GCRM at Wisconsin Gas. Under the new GCRMs, gas costs will be passed directly to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause. However, both companies will have the opportunity to increase or decrease earnings by up to approximately 2.5% of their total annual gas costs based upon how closely actual gas commodity and capacity costs compare to benchmarks established by the PSCW. Recent changes in the benchmarks applied resulted in no increase in current earnings under the GCRM in 2001 versus an increase in the earnings of Wisconsin Gas of $3.0 million before tax in 2000. Commodity Price Risk: The gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have commodity risk management programs that have been approved by the PSCW. These programs hedge the cost of natural gas and therefore changes in the value of the financial instruments do not impact net income. These programs allow the Companys gas utilities to utilize call and put option contracts to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchases and gas in storage. Under these programs, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric have the ability to hedge up to 50% of their planned flowing gas and storage inventory volumes. The cost of applicable call and put option contracts, as well as gains or losses realized under the contracts, do not affect net income as they are fully recovered under the purchase gas adjustment clauses of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric gas cost recovery mechanisms. In addition, under the Gas Cost Incentive Mechanism, Wisconsi n Gas and Wisconsin Electric use derivative financial instruments to manage the cost of gas. The cost of these financial instruments, as well as any gains or losses on the contracts, are subject to sharing under the incentive mechanisms. Michigan Jurisdiction Wisconsin Electric Power Company: In mid November 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application with the Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") requesting an electric retail rate increase of $3.7 million (9.4%) on an annualized basis. Hearings on this rate relief request were completed in June of 2001. In December of 2001, the MPSC issued an order reopening the case on a limited basis to incorporate the rate effects of the transfer of Wisconsin Electric transmission assets to ATC. Hearings are scheduled for April 2002 with a Proposal for Decision expected around June 1, 2002. Edison Sault Electric Company: In September 1995, the MPSC approved Edison Saults application to implement price cap regulation for its electric customers in the state of Michigan, capping base rates at existing levels, rolling its existing fuel cost adjustment procedure or Power Supply Cost Recovery ("PSCR") factor into base rates and suspending its existing PSCR clause. Edison Sault is required to give thirty days notice for rate decreases. The order authorizing Edison Saults price cap represents a temporary experimental regulatory mechanism and allows Edison Sault to file an application seeking an increase in rates under extraordinary circumstances. On October 2, 2000, Edison Sault filed a report with the MPSC addressing its experience under the price cap mechanism. In September of 2000, Edison Sault submitted an application to reinstate its PSCR clause in January 2002 and to incorporate therein 2002 incremental ATC charges and certain miscellaneous costs. On October 1, 2001, Edison Sault filed an application with the MPSC to establish its PSCR factor for the year 2002. The matter is pending. Any PSCR revenues collected during 2002 would be subject to a true up hearing. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Consistent with the requests in Wisconsin noted above, Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault requested from the MPSC in September 2001 rate recovery of estimated 2002 transmission costs over 2001 levels in the amount of $0.3 million for Wisconsin Electric and $0.6 million for Edison Sault for their operations in Michigan through the Michigan Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism. Both the requests are pending. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power as a result of modern digital equipment, Wisconsin Energy is evaluating and updating its electric distribution system as part of its enhanced Power the Future strategy. The Company is taking some immediate steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of the Companys existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance the Companys current electric distribution infrastructure. In the long term, Wisconsin Energy is initiating a new distribution system design that is expected to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy, using new technology, advanced communications and a two way electricity flow. Implementation of the Power the Future strategy is subject to a number of state and f ederal regulatory approvals. For additional information, see "Corporate Developments" above. Wisconsin Electric had adequate capacity to meet all of its firm electric load obligations during 2001. Public appeals for conservation were not required, nor was there the need to interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates. All of Wisconsin Electrics generating plants performed well during the hottest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. Wisconsin Electric expects to have adequate capacity to meet all of its firm load obligations during 2002. However, extremely hot weather along with unexpected equipment unavailability could require Wisconsin Electric to call upon load management procedures during 2002 as it has in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, Wisconsin Energy faces potentially significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting the Companys utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as carbon dioxide ("CO2"), sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), nitrogen oxide, small particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel, and (5) the eventual decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Wisconsin Energy is currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage its environmental issues including (1) substitution of new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of the Power the Future strategy, (2) development of additional sources of renewable elec tric energy supply, (3) participation in regional initiatives to reduce the emissions of NOx from the Companys fossil fuel fired generating facilities, (4) participation in voluntary programs with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to reduce overall emissions, including mercury, from Wisconsin Electrics coal fired power plants, (5) recycling of ash from coal fired generating units and (6) the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see "Nuclear Operations" below and "Note F Nuclear Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In July 1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. Although specific emission control requirements are not yet defined and despite legal challenges to these standards that will impact compliance requirements and timing, Wisconsin Electric believes that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from coal fired generating facilities. If these new standards withstand ongoing legal challenges, Wisconsin Electric expects that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the ozone attainment standards will be implemented in stages from 2004 through 2012, beginning with the ozone transport reductions described below. Reductions associated with the new particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and extending to the year 2017. Beyond the cost estimates identified below, Wisconsin Electric is currently unable to estimate the impact of the revised air quality standards on its future liquidity, financial condition or results of operation. Ozone Non Attainment Rulemaking: In October 1998, the EPA promulgated ozone transport rules to address transport of NOx and ozone into ozone non attainment areas in the eastern half of the United States. The rules would have required electric utilities in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia, including the state of Wisconsin, to significantly reduce NOx emissions by May 1, 2003. A court decision on these challenges was issued in March 2000 excluding the state of Wisconsin but continuing to include southern Michigan as one of 19 states in a region east of the Mississippi River that would remain subject to the October 1998 rules. Independent of any court decisions, Wisconsin and some other states in the Lake Michigan region have concluded rulemaking proceedings that require utilities, including Wisconsin Electric, to reduce NOx emissions as part of separate, existing 1 hour ozone attainment demonstration rules required by the EPA for the Lake Michigan regions severe non attainment areas. In the meantime, ambient monitoring data from the past three years shows that the Lake Michigan region is now in attainment with the 1 hour ozone standard. The state of Wisconsin and other Lake Michigan region states are in the process of submitting a redesignation (to attainment) plan to the EPA. This plan will continue to require the utility NOx reductions previously required when the area was in nonattainment. The NOx reductions will now be part of the maintenance and contingency plans required by the redesignation plan. Michigans and Wisconsins rules are both in effect. Wisconsin Electric currently expects to incur total capital costs of $150 million to $200 million and annual operation and maintenance costs of $6 million to $9 million during the period 2001 through 2004 to comply with the Michigan and Wisconsin rules. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NOx emission reductions requirements will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPAs July 1997 revisions to the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards discussed above. In January 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics comprehensive plan to meet the Wisconsin regulations, permitting recovery in rates of NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period and requiring that these costs be separately itemized on customer bills. Mercury Emission Control Rulemaking: As required by the 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA issued a regulatory determination in December 2000 that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. The EPA will develop draft rules within the next three years. In June 2001, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") independently developed draft mercury emission control rules that would affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. The draft rules call for 30%, 50% and 90% reductions in mercury air emissions over 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. The draft rules also require offsets for new mercury emitting generating facilities. Wisconsins draft rules were not finalized before the end of 2001 and will likely be revised before being finalized. The Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate rules that will be developed and adopted by the EPA or the WDNR, nor is it able to predict the impacts, if any, that the EPAs and WDNRs mercury emissi on control rulemakings might have on the operations of its existing or potential coal fired generating facilities. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see "Note O Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its combustion byproducts. For further information, see "Note O Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Manufacturing Segment: WICOR Industries has provided reserves sufficient to cover its estimated costs related to known contamination associated with its manufacturing facilities. EPA Information Requests: Wisconsin Electric and Wisvest Connecticut LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisvest, have each received requests for information from the EPA regional offices pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information, see "Note O Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LEGAL MATTERS Giddings & Lewis Inc./City of West Allis Lawsuit: In July 1999, a jury issued a verdict against Wisconsin Electric awarding the plaintiffs $4.5 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages in an action alleging that Wisconsin Electric had deposited contaminated wastes at two sites in West Allis, Wisconsin owned by the plaintiffs. In September 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned the $100 million punitive damage award and remanded the punitive damage claim back to the lower court for retrial. In January 2002, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs petition for review. For further information, see "Note O Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Wisconsin International Electric Power Litigation: During 1999, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin International Electric Power, Ltd. reached settlement of litigation brought by Wisconsin International Electric Power against Wisconsin Electric claiming that Wisconsin Electric had breached contractual duties allegedly owed to the plaintiff relating to development of an electric generating plant at Subic Bay in the Philippines. While Wisconsin Electric does not believe that it breached any contractual duties allegedly owed to the plaintiff, Wisconsin Electric paid Wisconsin International Electric Power, Ltd. $18.0 million ($10.8 million, or $0.09 per share for Wisconsin Energy, after tax) in November 1999 to settle the case, and the plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric owns two 510 megawatt electric generating units at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin which are operated by Nuclear Management Company, LLC ("NMC"), a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, Point Beach provided 25%, 23% and 22% of Wisconsin Electrics net electric energy supply, respectively. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating licenses for Point Beach expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. In July 2000, Wisconsin Electrics senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both units at Point Beach. Subject to approval by the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors and the PSCW, the project may be completed by May 2008 and could add approximately 90 megawatts of electrical output to Point Beach. Wisconsin Electric has formed an operating license renewal team which is expected to complete a technical and economic evaluation of license renewal by late 2002. Based upon the results of this evaluation and subject to approval by executive management and by the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Energy in early 2003, Wisconsin Electric will determine whether to seek appropriate regulatory approvals, including submittal of an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in mid 2003 for an extension of the operating licenses for Point Beach Nuclear Plant for a period of up to 20 years. Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During 1995, Wisconsin Electric completed construction of a facility at Point Beach for the temporary dry storage of up to 48 canisters containing used nuclear fuel. During 2000, Wisconsin Electric finished loading the last of twelve canisters originally authorized by the PSCW. On March 13, 2001, the PSCW approved a May 2000 application for authority to load additional temporary used fuel dry storage containers beyond the twelve that were originally authorized. The application requested authorization for sufficient additional containers, at a cost of up to approximately $46 million, to operate Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to the end of their current operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the facility. NMC is under contract with a new vendor to supply the next generation of used fuel dry storage containers for Point Beach. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the United States Department of Energy takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987 (the "Waste Act"). Effective January 31, 1998, the Department of Energy failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $177.6 million over the life of the plant. The Department of Energy has indicated that it does not expect a permanent used fuel repository to be available any earlier than 2010. It is not possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the Department of Energy will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel. On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the Department of Energys failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach in the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the Department of Energy in the Court of Federal Claims. The matter is pending. As of August 2000, Wisconsin Electric has incurred damages in excess of $35 million, which it seeks to recover from the United States Department of Energy. Damages will continue to accrue, and, accordingly, Wisconsin Electric expects to seek to recover all of its damages in this lawsuit. During 2000, President Clinton vetoed legislation that would have required the United States Department of Energy to establish a temporary used fuel repository in the state of Nevada until a permanent repository is available and to begin taking ownership from utilities and removing used fuel as required by the Waste Act. The Senate and the House failed to override the Presidents veto. Wisconsin Electric is unable to predict whether similar legislation might be reintroduced and passed during 2002 or President Bushs administration might support and sign such legislation. In January 2002, as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham notified Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn and the Nevada Legislature that he intended to recommend to President Bush that the Yucca Mountain site is scientifically sound and suitable for development as the nations long term geological repository for used nuclear fuel. On February 14, 2002, Secretary Abraham provided the formal recommendation to President Bush. In a February 2002, letter to Congress, President Bush expressed his support for the development of the Yucca Mountain site. The letter also affirmed the need for a permanent repository by supporting the need for nuclear power and its cost competitiveness, as well as acknowledging that successful completion of the repository program will redeem the clear Federal legal obligation set forth in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry Driven by a combination of market forces, regulatory and legislative initiatives and technological changes, the nations electric industry has followed a trend in recent years towards restructuring and increased competition. In the Midwest region, the state of Illinois passed legislation that introduced retail electric choice for large customers in 1999 and introduces choice for all retail customers by May 2002. As described in further detail below, full retail electric choice was introduced in the state of Michigan in January 2002. Congress continues to evaluate restructuring proposals at the federal level. However, recent severe electric supply constraints and a resulting rise in the cost of electricity in California has revitalized public debate in Wisconsin concerning deregulation. Given the current status of restructuring initiatives in regulatory jurisdictions where the Company primarily does business, Wisconsin Energy cannot predict the ultimate timing or impact of a restructured electric indu stry on its financial position or results of operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, Wisconsin is proceeding with restructuring of the electric utility industry at a much slower pace than many other states in the United States. Instead, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin such as: Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state; Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; and The previously described formation of a statewide transmission company, American Transmission Company LLC, which became operational January 1, 2001. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: In June 2000, the Governor of the state of Michigan signed the "Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act" into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. In effect, the new law provides that all Michigan retail customers of investor owned utilities have the ability to choose their electric power producer after January 1, 2002. The Michigan Retail Access law was characterized by Michigan Governor Engler as "Choice for those who want it and protection for those who need it." As of January 1, 2002, Michigan retail customers of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault plan to maintain their generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as they have in the past. Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault expect to continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Power supply revenue in 2001 from Wisconsin Energys eligible electric Michigan retail choice customers was less than $40 million, or approximately 1.6% of total utility operating revenue. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in the companies service territories in Michigan has started very slowly with little alternate supplier activity, reflecting the small market area, the companies competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW has instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on the Companys results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board authorized issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS 141"), and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Both accounting pronouncements were effective beginning January 1, 2002, although both standards require that business combinations which occurred after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the new accounting standards. For further information, see "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also authorized issuance of SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred . Upon adoption, the Company may be required to modify its accounting for nuclear decommissioning. Wisconsin Energy has not yet completed the evaluation of application of the SFAS 143 rules. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144, which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, requires entities to test long lived assets (asset groups) for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company adopted SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2002. Wisconsin Energy has not yet completed the evaluation of application of the SFAS 144 rules. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Regulatory Accounting: Wisconsin Energys utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may result in future utility prices which are based upon factors other than the traditional original cost of investment. In such a situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation ("SFAS 71"), may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. Such a charge could be material. The Company continually reviews the applicability of SFAS 71 and has determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. At this time, the Company is unable to predict whether any adjustments to regulatory assets and liabilities will occur in the future. See "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Accounting for Derivative Instruments: SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted this statement effective January 1, 2001, which resulted in a net SFAS 133 charge of $0.11 per share for 2001. For further information, see "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note K Derivative Instruments" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
