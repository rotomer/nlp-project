ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment, a non utility energy segment and a manufacturing segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms "Wisconsin Energy" or the "Company" refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries. The utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric Power Company ("Wisconsin Electric") and Wisconsin Gas Company ("Wisconsin Gas"), both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies", and Edison Sault Electric Company ("Edison Sault"), is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The non utility energy segment primarily consists of Wisvest Corporation ("Wisvest") and W.E. Power, LLC ("We Power"). We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric and other utilities. The manufacturing segment consists of companies which manufacture pumps as well as fluid processing and pump filtration equipment. Acquisition of WICOR, Inc.: On April 26, 2000, Wisconsin Energy acquired WICOR, Inc. ("WICOR"). WICOR is the parent of Wisconsin Gas, the largest natural gas distribution utility in Wisconsin, and of WICOR Industries, Inc. ("WICOR Industries"), an intermediate holding company which owns several manufacturers of pumps as well as fluid processing and pump filtration equipment. This business combination was accounted for as a purchase and, therefore, is reflected prospectively in Wisconsin Energys consolidated financial statements from and after the date of the acquisition. Cautionary Factors: Certain statements contained herein are "Forward Looking Statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward Looking Statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by the use of forward looking terminology such as "may," "intends," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "objectives," "plans," "possible," "potential," "project" or similar terms or variations of these terms. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in Forward Looking Statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, changes in political and economic conditions, equity and bond market fluctuations, varying weather conditions, governmental regulation and supervision, as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") including factors described throughout this document and below in "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources". CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities With the acquisition of WICOR in April of 2000, the Company redefined its core competencies to include electric generation within the Midwest, electric and gas distribution, and manufacturing. In 2000, as part of an internal strategic planning process, management and the Board concluded that it was not practical to continue the strategy of competing in the non regulated energy market outside of the Midwest. The Company seeks to increase shareholder value by leveraging on the core competencies within its business segments. Wisconsin Energys key corporate strategy is Power the Future which was announced in September 2000. This strategy is designed to increase the electric generating capacity in the state of Wisconsin while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It also is designed to improve the delivery of energy within the Companys distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands, and it is committed to improved environmental performance. The Power the Future strategy, which is discussed further below, is expected to have a significant impact on the Companys utility and non utility energy segments. 33 Utility Energy Segment: This segment is realizing operating efficiencies through the integration of the operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. These operating efficiencies should increase customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. In connection with the Power the Future strategy, over the next decade, the Company plans to invest approximately $2.7 billion to improve the existing energy distribution system and approximately $1.3 billion to upgrade existing electric generating assets. This segment is also planning to invest approximately $150 million over the next three years to improve the availability of natural gas supplies to the state of Wisconsin. Manufacturing Segment: This segment continues to build on the strong name recognition and customer relationships that were developed under WICOR. This segment intends to continue its growth through international expansion, acquiring value adding businesses, capturing cost efficiencies, implementing operating process improvements, and increasing sales through new product introductions and expanded market share. Non Utility Energy Segment: This segment will primarily focus on improving the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power has been formed to design, construct, own, finance and lease new generation assets and improvements in Wisconsin Electrics existing generation assets under the Power the Future strategy. The majority of Wisvests assets have been divested in order to direct the capital and management attention to Power the Future. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, Wisconsin Energy announced enhancements to a 10 year, $7 billion strategy, originally proposed in September 2000, to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. This Power the Future strategy is intended to meet the growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. According to a report issued in June 2001, by the Wisconsin Governors Office, demand for electricity in the state of Wisconsin is currently expected to outstrip supply by 7,220 megawatts by the year 2016. Power the Future would add new coal and natural gas capacity to the states power portfolio and would allow Wisconsin Electric to roughly maintain its current fuel mix. As part of its Power the Future strategy, Wisconsin Energy plans to make the following investments over the next decade: Approximately $3 billion in 2,800 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity at existing sites; Approximately $1.3 billion in upgrades to existing electric generating assets; and Approximately $2.7 billion in new and existing energy distribution system assets. In November 2001, Wisconsin Energy created a new non utility energy subsidiary, We Power, that will design, construct, own, finance and lease the new generating capacity. Under the enhanced Power the Future strategy, Wisconsin Electric, subject to approval by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin ("PSCW"), would lease each new facility and would operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric could have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or renew the lease, depending on tax considerations at that time. Smaller investor owned or municipal utilities, cooperatives and power marketing associations would have the opportunity to participate in the project, including expanding or extending wholesale power purchases from Wisconsin Electric as a result of the additional electric generating capacity included in the proposal. Wisconsin Electric expects that all lease payments and operating costs of the plants will be recoverable in rates. Implementation of the Companys Power the Future strategy is subject to a number of regulatory approvals. In February 2001, Wisconsin Energy made preliminary filings for its enhanced Power the Future proposal with the PSCW. Subsequently, the state legislature amended several laws, making changes which are critical to the implementation of Power the Future. On October 16, 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with Power the Future and for the Company to incur the associated pre certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the PSCW in order to be recovered. The Midwest Independent Power Suppliers Coordination Group ("MWIPS") filed a Petition for Judicial Review with the Dane County Circuit Court asking the Circuit Court to reverse and remand the PSCWs declaratory ruling. Wisconsin Electric filed a Notice of Appearance and Statement of Position asking that the declaratory ruling be 34 upheld and the Petition for Judicial Review be dismissed. Upon motion of the PSCW and with the consent of MWIPS the judicial review proceeding was dismissed on its merits on January 2, 2003. The application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity ("CPCN") for the Power the Future project was filed with the PSCW in February of 2002. In April of 2002 the PSCW authorized the CPCN approval process to be bifurcated by fuel source, which would expedite the issuance of a CPCN certificate for the Port Washington combined cycle gas project. Correspondingly, on April 25, 2002 the CPCN application for the Port Washington Generating Station was deemed complete by the PSCW. Hearings for the Port Washington Generating Station were held in September 2002, and a written order approving the issuance of a CPCN for the project was received in December 2002. The CPCN filing for the generating station at the Companys existing Oak Creek Power Plant site was deemed complete by the PSCW on November 15, 2002. In January 2003, certain intervenors filed with the PSCW a Petition for Review of the completeness determination seeking its reversal. The Company is opp osing the petition and believes that the PSCW will reject the petition and reaffirm its completeness determination. Under the current schedule, Wisconsin Energy anticipates receiving a decision from the PSCW on the Oak Creek site in late 2003. Wisconsin Energy continues to work with the PSCW and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("WDNR") to obtain all required permits and project approvals. Wisconsin Energy anticipates obtaining the capital necessary to finance and execute Power the Future from a combination of internal and external sources. For further information concerning the Power the Future strategy, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Divestiture of Non Core Assets The Power the Future strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily include non utility generation assets located outside of the Midwest and a substantial amount of Wispark LLCs real estate portfolio. Since 2000, the Company has received total proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the divestiture of non core assets as follows: Proceeds from: (Millions of Dollars) Non Utility Energy $542 Transmission 120 Real Estate 332 Other 19 Total Assets Divested $1,013 35 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares Wisconsin Energys diluted earnings per share by business segment for 2002 and 2001 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis.

(b) Includes the holding company, other non utility companies and merger related costs. Merger related costs in 2001 and 2000 include primarily interest expense net of tax related to the WICOR merger. (c) During 2002, the valuation charge consists of a $0.79 per share write down primarily attributable to the non utility energy segment. During 2001, the valuation charge consists of a $0.21 per share write down of non utility assets. During 2000, valuation charges consist of $0.26 per share related to the valuation of non core investments. (d) During 2001, the gain on asset sales consists of $0.14 per share of gains on the sale of the Companys interests in Blythe Energy, LLC, and FieldTech, Inc. During 2000, the gain on assets sales consists of a $0.45 per share gain on the sale of the Companys interests in SkyGen Energy Holdings, LLC. (e) The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives. (f) During 2002, the litigation charges consist of $0.09 per share for the settlement of litigation with the City of West Allis in the second quarter of 2002 and Giddings & Lewis Inc. and Kearney & Trecker Corporation (now part of Giddings & Lewis) in the third quarter of 2002. (g) During 2000, non recurring charges consist of $0.33 per share related to severance and employee benefits, and a $0.10 per share contribution to the Wisconsin Energy Foundation. Wisconsin Energy had net income of $1.44 per share during 2002 compared with net income of $1.86 per share during 2001. Adjusted earnings, which exclude a non cash impairment charge and gains on asset sales, litigation charges and goodwill amortization increased to $2.32 per share during 2002 as compared to $2.11 per share for the same period in 2001. The Company had net income of $1.86 per share during 2001 compared with pro forma net income of $1.27 per share during 2000. Adjusted earnings, which exclude non cash losses on investments and gains on asset sales and non recurring charges, increased to $2.11 per share during 2001 as compared to $1.69 per share for 2000 on a pro forma basis. These changes in adjusted earnings are primarily due to the following items: 36 2002 2001 2001 2000 pro forma per share per share Electric utility margins $0.34 $0.34 Gas utility margins 0.11 (0.08) Interest expense 0.12 0.15 Manufacturing earnings 0.06 0.01 Non utility energy segment earnings (losses) (0.12) 0.01 2002 second outage nuclear expenses (0.08) ATC incremental transmission expenses, net (0.05) 2001 interest income accrual on litigation (0.05) 0.05 2002 costs for early repayment of $103.4 million of long term debt (0.03) Other, net (0.09) (0.06) Total change in adjusted earnings per share $0.21 $0.42 An analysis of contributions to earnings by segment follows. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS Net earnings for the utility energy segment increased by $20.8 million or 7.6% in 2002 compared to reported 2001 earnings. The increase is primarily attributable to improved electric and gas margins, a strong focus on managing financial resources and reduced financing costs. Offsetting these items were $17.3 million for litigation settlements, $10.5 million in reduced interest income, $5.3 million in costs in 2002 for the early repayment of $103.4 million of long term debt and additional expenses related to nuclear operations. Utility net earnings during 2001 increased by $114.4 million to $274.4 million compared to reported 2000 earnings. The primary causes for the growth in utility earnings were $90.0 million attributable to price increases to recover higher fuel, purchased power and other operating costs primarily from the electric business, a $24.5 million increase attributable to Wisconsin Gas operations as a result of the seasonality of the gas heating business, the timing of the acquisition of Wisconsin Gas as part of the acquisition of WICOR in April 2000 and $10.5 million of interest income accrued on the deposit tendered in the Giddings & Lewis, Inc./City of West Allis lawsuit. Utility net earnings during 2001 increased by $54.0 million when compared to 2000 pro forma earnings. The primary causes for this increase were $65.8 million attributable to higher electric utility gross margins and $10.5 million of interest income accrued on the deposit in the Giddings & Lewis, Inc./City of West Allis lawsuit offset partially by a decrease of $15.6 million of gas utility gross margins. 37 The following table summarizes the utility energy segments earnings during 2002 and 2001 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Actual Pro forma Utility Energy Segment 2002 2001 2000 (b) 2000 (a) (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $1,910.8 $1,867.4 $1,797.8 $1,797.8 Gas 918.1 1,074.5 736.3 952.3 Other 23.2 22.9 22.6 22.9 Total Operating Revenues 2,852.1 2,964.8 2,556.7 2,773.0 Fuel and Purchased Power 496.7 517.3 513.5 513.5 Cost of Gas Sold 574.9 751.6 486.7 613.8 Gross Margin 1,780.5 1,695.9 1,556.5 1,645.7 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 830.2 765.5 757.9 742.3 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 308.3 320.1 308.5 321.1 Property and Revenue Taxes 79.9 75.4 71.0 71.1 Operating Income 562.1 534.9 419.1 511.2 Other Income (Deductions) 24.5 36.8 (13.6) 6.3 Financing Costs 107.3 116.4 140.5 150.5 Income Before Income Taxes 479.3 455.3 265.0 367.0 Income Taxes 184.1 180.9 105.0 146.6 Net Earnings $295.2 $274.4 $160.0 $220.4 Adjusted Earnings (c) $305.8 $280.5 $220.2 $242.2 (a) Includes Wisconsin Gas as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect the operations of Wisconsin Gas subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. (c) During 2002, adjusted earnings exclude $10.6 million after tax related to the Giddings & Lewis, Inc./City of West Allis lawsuit. During 2001, adjusted earnings exclude a net loss on investments of $1.2 million and WICOR acquisition purchase accounting entries, primarily goodwill amortization and interest expense. During 2000, adjusted earnings exclude $45.9 million of net non recurring charges primarily associated with the WICOR merger. In addition, 2000 adjusted earnings exclude the WICOR acquisition purchase accounting entries. Electric Utility Revenues, Gross Margins and Sales The following table compares Wisconsin Energys electric utility operating revenues and its gross margin during 2002 with similar information for 2001 and 2000. 38 Electric Revenues and Gross Margin Megawatt Hour Sales Electric Utility Operations 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands) Operating Revenues Residential $703.0 $654.5 $606.7 8,310.9 7,773.4 7,633.2 Small Commercial/Industrial 606.3 592.9 550.0 8,719.5 8,595.4 8,524.7 Large Commercial/Industrial 483.1 479.7 472.8 11,129.6 11,177.6 11,824.0 Other Retail/Municipal 77.7 70.6 64.7 2,051.9 1,828.6 1,755.8 Resale Utilities 18.1 56.8 79.1 650.7 1,687.6 2,304.7 Other Operating Revenues 22.6 12.9 24.5 Total Operating Revenues 1,910.8 1,867.4 1,797.8 30,862.6 31,062.6 32,042.4 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 278.9 308.8 325.3 Purchased Power 211.1 202.3 182.0 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 490.0 511.1 507.3 Gross Margin $1,420.8 $1,356.3 $1,290.5 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,769 Normal) 6,551 6,338 6,716 Cooling (703 Normal) 897 711 566 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2002 vs 2001: During 2002, total electric energy sales decreased by 0.6% compared with 2001, primarily reflecting a decline in sales for resale to other utilities due to a reduced demand for wholesale power. Most of the remaining customer classes had increased sales in 2002 reflecting favorable weather and the growth in the average number of customers. Sales to Wisconsin Electrics largest commercial/industrial customers, two iron ore mines, declined by 2.8% between the comparative periods due to the shutdown of a mine in the first quarter of 2002. Excluding these mines, total commercial/industrial electric sales increased by 0.8% and sales to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers increased by 0.1% between the comparative periods. During 2002, Wisconsin Energys total electric utility operating revenues increased by $43.4 million or 2.3% compared with 2001 due to favorable weather, the full year impact of price increases related to fuel and purchased power and a surcharge related to transmission costs. As measured by cooling degree days, 2002 was 26.2% warmer than 2001 and 27.6% warmer than normal. In February and May 2001, Wisconsin Electric received increases in rates to cover increased fuel and purchased power costs. On a year to year basis, the fuel surcharge resulted in $10.0 million of additional revenue. For additional information concerning the rate increases, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Even with the increased fuel revenues, the Company estimates that it under recovered fuel and purchased power costs by $2.3 million and $0.1 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, in October 2002, the Company implemented a PSCW approved surcharge for r ecovery of increased annual transmission costs associated with American Transmission Company LLC ("ATC") which increased 2002 revenues by approximately $8.7 million. Between the comparative periods, fuel and purchased power expenses decreased by $21.1 million or 4.1% primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower wholesale power prices, and lower megawatt sales. These reductions were partially offset by higher costs due to a larger number of planned outages including a second refueling outage at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant during 2002. The lower fuel and purchased power expenses and increased sales to higher margin customers offset the impact on electric revenues of the decline in electric megawatt hours such that the total gross margin on electric operating revenues increased by $64.5 million or 4.8% during 2002 compared with the same period in 2001. 2001 vs 2000: During 2001, total electric sales fell by 3.1% compared with 2000, reflecting a softening economy that especially affected large commercial and industrial customers such as Wisconsin Electrics largest retail customers, two iron ore mines. Sales to these mines decreased by 17.7% during 2001. Excluding the two mines, total electric sales decreased 1.8% during 2001 and sales to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers decreased by 2.3% when compared with 2000. Due to warmer weather during the summer of 2001, a 1.8% increase 39 in sales to residential customers, who are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins than other customer classes, partially offset the effects of the soft economy on electric sales during 2001. As measured by cooling degree days, 2001 was 25.6% warmer than 2000 and 3.8% warmer than normal. Sales for resale to other utilities, the Resale Utilities customer class, declined 26.8% during 2001 primarily as a result of reduced demand for wholesale power. During 2001, Wisconsin Energys total electric utility operating revenues increased by $69.6 million or 3.9% compared with 2000. Wisconsin Energy attributes this growth mostly to incremental rate increases in effect during 2001 related to higher fuel, purchased power and other operating costs. For additional information concerning these rate increases, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Higher electric cooling load during the summer of 2001 caused by a return to normal summer weather also contributed to the growth in electric operating revenues. These revenue increases were partially offset by a reduction in total electric sales during 2001 due in large part to a softening economy in the region. Purchased power expenses increased by $20.3 million or 11.2% during 2001 primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, as a result of higher demand costs during 2001 associated with purchased power contracts. A $16.5 million or 5.1% decline in fuel costs during 2001, primarily driven by a change in the Companys electric supply mix to lower cost nuclear generation and by an overall reduction in demand for electric energy during 2001, resulted in a net increase in fuel and purchased power expenses of $3.8 million or 0.7% when compared with 2000. Due to the 3.9% increase in operating revenues partially offset by the slightly higher fuel and purchased power costs, electric gross margin (total electric utility operating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses) grew by $65.8 million or 5.1% during 2001 when compared with 2000. Gas Utility Revenues and Gross Margins The following table compares Wisconsin Energys gas utility operating revenues and its gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2002 and 2001 with similar information for 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Actual Pro forma Gas Utility Operations 2002 2001 2000 (b) 2000 (a) (Millions of Dollars) Gas Operating Revenues $918.1 $1,074.5 $736.3 $952.3 Cost of Gas Sold 574.9 751.6 486.7 613.8 Gross Margin $343.2 $322.9 $249.6 $338.5 (a) Includes Wisconsin Gas as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. For further information concerning gas utility operations during the comparative periods, see "Gas Utility Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries" below. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect the operations of Wisconsin Gas subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. 2002 vs 2001: During 2002, total gas utility operating revenues decreased by $156.4 million or 14.6% compared to 2001, due to lower gas costs offset in part by increased deliveries resulting from colder winter weather. This decline primarily reflects a decrease in natural gas costs in 2002 which are passed on to customers under gas cost recovery mechanisms. 2001 vs 2000: During 2001, Wisconsin Energys gas operating revenues increased by $122.2 million or 12.8% when compared with 2000 pro forma revenues. This increase reflected a $137.8 million increase due to increases in the cost of gas sold offset in part by warmer weather which reduced volumes sold. 40 Gas Utility Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries The following table compares gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries during 2002, 2001 and pro forma 2000 as if Wisconsin Gas had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2002 2001 2000 (a) 2002 2001 2000 (a) (Millions of Dollars) (Millions) Customer Class Residential $224.6 $209.0 $216.0 817.1 756.3 803.8 Commercial/Industrial 67.4 62.3 64.4 463.1 427.7 462.1 Interruptible 2.1 2.0 2.5 29.4 25.8 35.2 Total Gas Sold 294.1 273.3 282.9 1,309.6 1,209.8 1,301.1 Transported Gas 41.9 41.4 47.0 811.7 787.4 897.1 Other Operating 7.2 8.2 8.6 Total $343.2 $322.9 $338.5 2,121.3 1,997.2 2,198.2 Weather Degree Days (b) Heating (6,769 Normal) 6,551 6,338 6,716 (a) Pro forma as if Wisconsin Gas had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. (b) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2002 vs 2001: Gas gross margin for 2002 totaled $343.2 million, or an increase of $20.3 million from 2001. This increase was primarily due to a return to colder winter weather in 2002 which increased the heating degree days compared to 2001. In addition, the Company had a rate increase which became effective December 20, 2001 which contributed $3.2 million in 2002. The average number of customers also increased in 2002 which favorably impacted the fixed component of operating revenues that is not affected by volumes fluctuations. 2001 vs 2000 pro forma: Gas margins totaled $322.9 million in 2001, or a $15.6 million decline from 2000 pro forma amounts. This decline was directly related to warmer winter weather which reduced the heating load. Total therm deliveries of natural gas decreased by 9.1% during 2001, but varied within customer classes. Volume deliveries for the residential and commercial/industrial customer classes decreased by 5.9% and 7.4%, respectively, reflecting warmer weather. Residential and commercial customers are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins per therm than other customers. Transportation volumes were 12.2% lower than the prior year reflecting fuel switching to lower cost fuel options and a softening economy. Other Utility Segment Items Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $64.7 million or 8.5% during 2002 compared with 2001. The most significant change in other operation and maintenance expenses between 2002 and 2001 resulted from $17.3 million for the settlements of litigation with the City of West Allis in the second quarter of 2002 and Giddings & Lewis Inc. and Kearney & Trecker Corporation (now part of Giddings & Lewis) in the third quarter of 2002. Increased other operation and maintenance expenses during 2002, were also attributable to $9.8 million of higher electric transmission expenses associated with ATC which were offset by increased revenues recorded due to the surcharge which became effective in October of 2002, $9.2 million of increased scheduled maintenance at several steam generation plants, and $15.4 million associated with the second scheduled outage and incremental costs associated wi th reactor vessel head inspections at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in 2002. In 2002, both Point Beach nuclear units had scheduled outages. In 2001, only one nuclear unit had a scheduled outage. One outage is scheduled for 2003. The Company also experienced an increase of $17.4 million for employee benefit and pension costs and $4.8 million in property insurance costs which were partially offset by cost reduction efforts during 2002. 41 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $23.2 million during 2001 when compared with 2000 pro forma amounts. The most significant change in other operation and maintenance expenses between the comparative periods resulted from $44.9 million of higher electric transmission expenses caused by a change in how electric transmission costs are recorded as a result of the transfer of Wisconsin Electrics and Edison Saults electric transmission assets to ATC on January 1, 2001. Partially offsetting this was a reduction in costs as a result of the WICOR merger, which led to the consolidation of common operating and support areas. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expenses: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses decreased by $11.8 million during 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of several shorter lived intangible assets and the adoption on January 1, 2002 of SFAS 142 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses were $1.0 million lower during 2001 compared with 2000 pro forma. The transfer of electric transmission assets to the ATC resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense, which was partially offset by increased capital asset additions for electric generation and for electric and gas distribution systems. MANUFACTURING SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS The manufacturing segment contributed $35.8 million to earnings during 2002, excluding costs related to the WICOR merger, compared to $29.1 million during 2001. Including WICOR merger costs, earnings were $24.0 million, or $14.3 million better than 2001. During 2001, the manufacturing segment contributed $29.1 million to earnings before merger costs, which was slightly better than the prior year pro forma amounts. Including WICOR merger costs, earnings were $9.7 million, or $1.7 million better than 2000 pro forma amounts. Prior to the WICOR acquisition, Wisconsin Energy did not have a manufacturing segment. The following table summarizes the manufacturing segments earnings during 2002, 2001 and 2000 on an actual and pro forma basis. Actual Pro forma Manufacturing Segment 2002 2001 2000 (b) 2000 (a) (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Domestic $507.6 $444.9 $294.1 $433.9 International 177.6 140.2 88.1 141.3 Total Operating Revenues 685.2 585.1 382.2 575.2 Cost of Goods Sold 513.2 428.0 274.5 415.8 Gross Margin 172.0 157.1 107.7 159.4 Other Operating Expenses 115.8 116.0 75.2 115.2 Operating Income 56.2 41.1 32.5 44.2 Other Income (Deductions) 0.3 0.3 (3.7) (5.7) Financing Costs 18.2 22.0 14.1 21.4 Income Before Income Taxes 38.3 19.4 14.7 17.1 Income Taxes 14.3 9.7 7.2 9.0 Net Earnings $24.0 $9.7 $7.5 $8.1 Adjusted Earnings (c) $35.8 $29.1 $21.5 $28.9 (a) Includes operations of the manufacturing segment as if it had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. (b) Wisconsin Energys financial statements reflect operations of the manufacturing segment subsequent to the WICOR merger on April 26, 2000. (c) Adjusted Earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 exclude merger related costs which represent WICOR acquisition purchase accounting entries, primarily goodwill amortization and interest expense. 42 2002 vs 2001: Manufacturing operating revenues increased by $100.1 million or 17.1% between 2002 and 2001. Recent acquisitions contributed incremental sales of $56.8 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, the Company experienced an 8.0% growth in its manufacturing business. Sales in almost all markets were up with the largest increases in water systems, pool/spa, R/V, and beverage and food markets. Domestic sales were up $62.7 million, and international sales increased $37.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, or 14.1% and 26.7% respectively, compared to the same period in 2001. The increases were due to acquisitions in 2002 and 2001, market share/customer growth, drought conditions in the United States and Australia, and new product introductions. Gross profit margin decreased to 25.1% in 2002 from 26.9% in 2001 due primarily to changes in the custo mer/product mix as a result of acquisitions and increased customer rebates due to sales growth. Operating income was up 36.7% primarily due to recent acquisitions, cost savings achieved through consolidation of operations, the continuation of cost improvement programs, and the adoption of SFAS 142 which eliminated amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets, offset by one time costs associated with consolidation of facilities in the first quarter of 2002. 2001 vs 2000 pro forma: Operating revenues were up by $9.9 million during 2001 as compared to pro forma operating revenues in 2000 primarily due to acquisitions, offset partially by the effects of a decline in the economy on base business sales and unfavorable foreign currency translations. The manufacturing segments modest decline reflects the steadiness and diversification of the markets it serves. For the year, operating income of $41.1 million was down $3.1 million compared with 2000 on a pro forma basis. Operating expenses increased slightly in 2001 primarily from additional operations due to the acquisitions offset in part by aggressive cost reduction initiatives implemented early in the year. The manufacturing segments results for 2000 were impacted by a series of expenses associated with the defense of intellectual property rights, development of a new beverage dispensing technology and the integration of an acquisition. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO EARNINGS As part of its ongoing efforts to divest non core assets, the Company significantly reduced certain of Wisvests operations during 2002 and 2001. The following table compares the non utility energy segments earnings during 2002, 2001 and actual and pro forma information for 2000. Actual Pro forma Non Utility Energy Segment 2002 2001 2000 2000 (c) (Millions of Dollars) Wisvest Connecticut Operations ($1.4) $20.8 $2.4 $2.4 SFAS 133, net 12.6 (12.6) We Power costs (4.1) Other Non utility energy operations (20.2) (6.0) (1.6) (2.0) Asset Sales/Valuation Charges (a) (81.3) 16.5 54.6 54.6 Non recurring Charges (b) (16.0) (16.0) Net Earnings (Loss) ($94.4) $18.7 $39.4 $39.0 (a) During the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.79 per share after tax primarily related to the decline in value in non utility assets held for sale. During 2001, the gain on asset sales consists of $0.14 per share of gains on the sale of the Companys interests in Blythe and FieldTech. During 2000, the gain on asset sales consists of a $0.45 per share gain on the sale of the Companys interests in SkyGen Energy Holdings, LLC ("SkyGen"). (b) During 2000, non recurring charges consist of $0.13 per share related to severance and employee benefits. (c) Includes the operations of the WICOR subsidiaries as if they had been part of Wisconsin Energy since January 1, 2000. In addition, earnings during 2000 include $16.1 million of net non recurring charges relating to severance costs associated with the divestiture of non core businesses and to write downs associated with certain investments. 43 2002 vs 2001: The decrease in earnings at Wisvest Connecticut, LLC can be broken down between operation of the assets and SFAS 133 gains or charges. During 2002, Wisvest Connecticut had an operating loss of $1.4 million compared to earnings of $20.8 million in 2001. This decline is directly related to lower wholesale market prices for electricity in the Northeast United States and an extended unscheduled outage at one of its major generating units from the last half of August through November 2002. In addition, on December 6, 2002, Wisvest completed the sale of Wisvest Connecticut to Public Service Enterprise Group. Under SFAS 133, Wisvest Connecticut recorded the changes in fair market value related to fuel oil contracts associated with its plants in the Northeast. During 2002, the Company recorded an after tax gain of $12.6 million on these contracts due to settlement of contract transactions and increases in fuel oil prices. During 2001, the Company recorded an after tax gain of $10.5 million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting upon the adoption of SFAS 133 offset by after tax charges of $23.1 million related to settlement of contract transactions and decreases in fuel oil prices. The loss from We Power operations in 2002 primarily relates to increased start up costs as it continues to develop power plants for the Power the Future initiative. The loss from other non utility energy segment operations for 2002 primarily relates to Wisvests Calumet natural gas based peaking power plant in Chicago, which was placed in service in June of 2002, and to an equity method investment in a power plant in Maine. The Calumet plant experienced start up costs and limited power production due to lower wholesale market prices for electricity in the Midwest during the last six months of 2002. The Maine plant also was negatively impacted by lower than expected wholesale electric prices. Asset Sales / Valuation Charges: During the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge of $92.0 million after tax or $0.79 per share. The impairment charge primarily related to two non utility energy assets classified as "Assets Held for Sale" as of December 31, 2001: the Wisvest Connecticut power plants and costs associated with a 500 megawatt power island consisting of gas turbine generators and related equipment. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company determined that the carrying value of these assets exceeded market values due to a significant decline in the non regulated energy markets resulting from many factors, including the collapse of Enron Corporation and the resulting tightening and downgrading of credit related to independent power producers. In addition, the electric forward price curves for the region declined due to the decline in natural gas costs and increased generating capacity. With the decline in market values, the non utility energy assets held for sale were written down $0.71 per share to current fair value less costs to sell. 2001 vs 2000: During 2001, earnings of Wisvest Connecticut increased by $18.4 million when compared with 2000 due primarily to both of Wisvest Connecticuts plants operating for the full year resulting in improved operating results. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, the Wisvest Connecticut assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. Under this accounting, no depreciation expense of long lived assets is reported. This change in accounting benefited the operating results by approximately $0.05 per share when compared to 2000. During 2000, one of Wisvest Connecticuts plants experienced an extended outage which increased purchased power and maintenance costs. The earnings from other non utility energy segment operations for 2001 decreased by $4.4 million on an actual basis or by $4.0 million when compared with 2000 on a pro forma basis. During 2001, the operations of WICOR Energy Services Company were merged into an unconsolidated affiliate of Wisconsin Energy, ending direct gas marketing activities by the non utility energy segment. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company sold FieldTech, Inc. and Wisvests interest in Blythe Energy, LLC, an independent power production project in the state of California, in separate transactions. Wisconsin Energy realized after tax gains of approximately $16.5 million or $0.14 per share as a result of the sales of FieldTech and Blythe. In October 2000, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in SkyGen Energy Holdings, LLC., which resulted in cash proceeds totaling approximately $332 million (including approximately $112 million for the repayment of certain advances, short term notes receivable and interest) and an after tax gain of $54.6 million or $0.45 per share. 44 CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS Other income and deductions increased by $43.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase is primarily due to $12.6 million in SFAS 133 gains for 2002 compared with charges of $12.6 million in 2001 discussed above, and $22.9 million due to a reduction in the level of write downs in the Witech Corporation venture capital portfolio offset in part by a decline in interest income during 2002 of $12.4 million primarily due to an interest accrual recorded in 2001 related to litigation. During 2001, the Company incurred $73.0 million of charges, which are recorded as "Other" in Other Income and Deductions. These charges primarily represented $38.5 million of SFAS 133 charges related to the decline in oil prices discussed above and $37.6 million in write downs in the Witech venture capital portfolio. During 2000, the Company incurred $39.3 million of charges which are recorded in "Other" in Other Income and Deductions. These charges primarily represented write downs of non core assets. CONSOLIDATED FINANCING COSTS Total financing costs decreased by $17.4 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates, and the early repayment of $103.4 million of long term debt. During 2001, total financing costs were $246.6 million, up slightly from 2000 amounts but mitigated by the decline in short term interest rates in 2001. During 2000, financing costs were $244.8 million. The 2000 financing costs were influenced by the April 2000 acquisition of WICOR, which resulted in almost $1.5 billion of additional debt for the Company. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES The Companys consolidated effective income tax rate was 38.8%, 41.9%, and 44.9% for each of the three years ending December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The lower rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization and the recognition of historical rehabilitation tax credits. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflects the amortization of the WICOR goodwill which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The 2000 effective income tax rate includes the amortization of WICOR goodwill for eight months, as well as the impact of a net unrealized capital loss. The effective income tax rate is negatively impacted by the inability to obtain a state tax benefit for state taxable losses of some of the separate legal entities within the Company. Those state taxable losses result primarily from interest expense. If the prospects for future taxable income for these legal entities should improve, the effective tax rate in years subsequent to 2002 may be favorably impacted. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes Wisconsin Energys cash flows during 2002, 2001 and 2000: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2002 2001 2000 (a) (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $711.3 $570.6 $461.0 Investing Activities ($365.8) ($479.1) ($1,520.5) Financing Activities ($348.9) ($85.0) $1,026.5 (a) Includes the operations of the WICOR subsidiaries subsequent to the merger on April 26, 2000. 45 Operating Activities During 2002, cash flow from operations increased to $711.3 million, or a $140.7 million improvement over 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to the return of a $100 million deposit plus accrued interest as a result of a favorable court ruling. During 2001, cash flow from operations increased to $570.6 million or $109.6 million over 2000 levels primarily attributable to increased operating income and higher non cash charges. Investing Activities During 2002, Wisconsin Energy had net cash outflows for investing activities of $365.8 million as compared to $479.1 million in 2001. For 2002 and 2001, capital expenditures totaled $556.8 million and $672.5 million, respectively. This decline in capital expenditures is due to less spending in the non utility energy segment. During 2001, the Company spent $672.5 million on capital expenditures, which was a $61.5 million increase over 2000. The largest increase in capital expenditures came within the utility energy segment for electric and gas distribution assets. During 2002 and 2001, the Companys manufacturing segment also made acquisitions totaling $16.5 million and $35.7 million, respectively. In 2000, the Company completed the WICOR acquisition at a purchase price of $1.2 billion, as well as a small manufacturing acquisition. These acquisitions were initially financed with short term commercial paper. In 2002 and 2001, the Company continued its strategy of divesting non core assets. During 2002 and 2001, the Company received proceeds from asset divestitures of $310.0 million and $294.4 million, respectively, related to the sale of the Wisvest Connecticut power plants in 2002, the transfer in 2001 of electric transmission assets to ATC, and the successful sale in 2001 of the Wisvest Blythe project and FieldTech. During 2000, the Company received proceeds from asset sales of approximately $408.4 million which primarily reflects the sale of Wisvests investment in SkyGen, an independent power producer. The SkyGen sale resulted in a gain of $0.45 per share in 2000. From 2000 through 2002, there were real estate sales totaling approximately $332.0 million. Financing Activities In September 2000, the Company initiated a share repurchase program. Since inception, the Company has repurchased and retired 13.1 million shares through December 31, 2002 at a cost of $286.7 million. In December 2002 the Board of Directors extended the program through December 31, 2004. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to the delay in the sale of non utility assets. Also, during 2002, Wisconsin Energy issued approximately 2.7 million of new shares of common stock and received payments aggregating $52.6 million under the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, other benefit plans and from the exercise of stock options. In September 2000, the Company also announced a reduction in the quarterly dividend from $0.39 per share to $0.20 per share. This action reduced the dividends paid in 2001 as compared to 2000 and also reduced the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Companys stock plans. During 2001, the Company refinanced approximately $1.3 billion of commercial paper through the issuance of intermediate term senior notes. In January 2002, the Company redeemed $100 million of 8 3/8% long term debt and $3.4 million of 9 1/8% long term debt. In December 2002, Wisconsin Electric retired $150.0 million of 6 5/8% debentures at maturity. These redemptions and maturity were financed with short term commercial paper bearing rates of approximately 2%. In 2002, Wisvest Connecticut paid down $180.5 million of nonrecourse variable rate notes following the sale of Wisvest Connecticut. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS As Wisconsin Energy continues to implement its strategy of leveraging on the core competencies of its business segments and building financial strength, Wisconsin Energy expects to continue to divest of non core assets, invest in core assets, buy back common stock and pay down debt. 46 Capital Resources The Company anticipates meeting its capital requirements during 2003 primarily through internally generated funds, short term borrowings, existing lines of credit supplemented through the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of common stock under the Companys stock plans. Beyond 2003, Wisconsin Energy anticipates meeting its capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, through the issuance of debt securities. Wisconsin Energy has previously filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which $200 million of securities remained unissued at year end 2002. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Energy may issue up to $200 million of debt securities during 2003 under this shelf registration statement. The Companys largest utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Electric, is planning to issue $575 million of debt securities in 2003 under an existing $800 million shelf registration statement, depending on market conditions and other factors, and use the proceeds to redeem four series of its outstanding debt securities aggregating $425.0 million and to repay short term debt incurred to retire $150 million of debt that matured in December 2002. The Company has access to the capital markets and has been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet its capital requirements. Wisconsin Energys ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to the Companys overall strategic plan. Wisconsin Energy believes that it has adequate capacity to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash. On December 31, 2002, Wisconsin Energy had approximately $1.2 billion of available unused lines of bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis. The Company had approximately $1.0 billion of total consolidated short term debt outstanding on such date. Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries review their bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support their operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2002: Company Total Facility Drawn Credit Available Facility Maturity Facility Term (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $300.0 $ $300.0 Apr 2003 364 day Wisconsin Energy 500.0 $ 500.0 Apr 2003 3 year Wisconsin Electric 230.0 $ 230.0 June 2003 364 day Wisconsin Gas 185.0 $ 185.0 Dec 2003 364 day On April 9, 2002, Wisconsin Energy entered into an unsecured 364 day $300 million bank back up credit facility to replace a credit facility that was expiring. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. Assuming certain conditions are met, any outstanding loans under the facility can be converted to a one year term loan. In addition to the Wisconsin Energy 364 day bank back up credit facility, the Company has an unsecured three year $500 million bank back up credit facility that will expire in April, 2003. On June 26, 2002, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured 364 day $230 million bank back up credit facility to replace a credit facility that was expiring. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. On December 11, 2002, Wisconsin Gas entered into an unsecured 364 day $175 million bank back up credit facility to replace a credit facility that was expiring. On December 18, 2002, the credit facility was increased from $175 million to $185 million. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. 47 During 2003, the Company intends to make arrangements for the construction financing of the We Power gas based Port Washington Generating Station project. The exact nature of the financing arrangements have not yet been determined. The following table shows Wisconsin Energys consolidated capitalization structure at December 31: Capitalization Structure 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $2,139.4 33.5% $2,056.1 31.4% Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries 30.4 0.5% 30.4 0.5% Trust Preferred Securities 200.0 3.1% 200.0 3.0% Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 3,070.8 48.0% 3,721.6 56.7% Short Term Debt 953.1 14.9% 550.4 8.4% Total $6,393.7 100.0% $6,558.5 100.0% As described in "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of Wisconsin Energys subsidiaries to transfer funds to Wisconsin Energy. The Company does not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on its operations or ability to meet its cash obligations. Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of the debt securities of Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries by Standard & Poors Corporation ("S&P"), Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys") and Fitch as of December 31, 2002. Commercial paper of WICOR Industries is unrated. S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A2 A Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 1 P 1 F1+ Secured Senior Debt A Aa2 AA Unsecured Debt A Aa3 AA Preferred Stock BBB+ A2 AA Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 1 P 1 F1+ Unsecured Senior Debt A Aa2 AA Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt A A2 A WEC Capital Trust I Trust Preferred Securities BBB A3 A In February 2003, Moodys placed under review for possible downgrade the security ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation. Moodys also placed under review for possible downgrade the long term security ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and confirmed the commercial paper rating of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. S&Ps and Fitchs current outlook for Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries is stable. 48 Wisconsin Energy believes these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Capital Requirements Total capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel and any manufacturing acquisitions, are currently estimated to be $693 million during 2003 attributable to the following operating segments: Estimated Actual Capital Expenditures 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $455 $405 Non Utility Energy Power the Future 186 53 Other 5 40 Manufacturing 20 15 Other 27 44 Total $693 $557 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards or electric reliability initiatives that impact the Companys utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. The utility energy segment currently expects capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel and expenditures for new generating capacity contained in the Power the Future strategy described below, to be between $400 million and $500 million per year during the next five years. Capital requirements over the next decade for Power the Future include approximately $3.0 billion to construct 2,800 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity, approximately $1.3 billion to upgrade existing electric generating assets and approximately $2.7 billion for energy distribution system upgrades. The capital required to support the $3.0 billion of new generation over the next decade is expected to come from a combination of internal and external sources. With the dividend reduction that began in 2001, the Company is expected to retain almost $90 million per year of additional cash flows, which will provide substantial funding for new generation. The Company is also divesting non utility assets which will provide additional cash. The new generating plants will be constructed by We Power, a non utility subsidiary, and leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25 30 year lease agreements. It is expected that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. It is anticipated that the Company will need external financing as the plants are constructed, but the cash flows from the lease payments, the asset divestitures and the additional cash retained within the Company as a result of the dividend reduction are expected to eliminate the need for additional equity fi nancing. Pension Investments: The Company has funded its pension obligations in outside trusts. During 2002, the pension investments in the trusts have performed consistent with the stock market which has resulted in double digit negative returns. In addition, interest rates have fallen, which results in a higher discounted pension obligation. The Company has recorded a minimum pension liability as of December 31, 2002 for $113.5 million due to the negative returns on pension assets and lower discount rates. Guardian Pipeline: As previously disclosed, the Companys subsidiary WICOR, Inc., is an equal one third joint venture partner in the Guardian Pipeline project ("Guardian"). In November 2001, Guardian Pipeline, L.L.C. obtained $170 million of fixed rate financing for the project, secured by guarantees severally from each partner, or an affiliate of each of the partners, for their one third share of the debt financing. The guarantees are effective 49 during the construction of the project and approximately the first six months of commercial operation. Guardian began commercial operation during the fourth quarter of 2002. Financial Instruments: Wisconsin Energy is a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of its normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. The Companys estimated maximum exposure under such agreements is approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2002. However, the Company believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements. See "Note O Guarantees" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information. Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: The Company has the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Less than 1 yr. 1 3 years 3 5 years After 5 years Total (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt (b) $15.2 $231.0 $761.3 $1,880.7 $2,888.2 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 56.1 89.9 71.1 437.5 654.6 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 33.6 77.0 77.8 88.2 276.6 Unconditional Purchase Obligations (e) 8.9 81.3 3.3 11.8 105.3 Other Long Term Obligations (f) 268.2 351.0 151.8 245.4 1,016.4 Total Contractual Cash Obligations $382.0 $830.2 $1,065.3 $2,663.6 $4,941.1 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Principal payments on Long Term Debt of Wisconsin Energy and affiliates (excluding capital lease obligations). (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for nuclear fuel lease and purchase power commitments. (d) Operating Leases Obligations for purchased power for Wisconsin Energy and affiliates. (e) Unconditional Purchase Obligations for information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. (f) Primarily other Long Term Obligations under various contracts of Wisconsin Energy and affiliates for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation, primarily related to utility operations. Obligations for utility operations by Wisconsin Energys utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. Guarantees: Wisconsin Energy provides various guarantees supporting certain of its subsidiaries. The guarantees issued by Wisconsin Energy guarantee payment or performance by its subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. As a result, the Companys exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary under the specified agreements or transactions. The majority of the guarantees issued by Wisconsin Energy limit the exposure of the Company to a maximum amount stated in the guarantees. See "Note O Guarantees" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information. 50 FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS The Company is exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of its businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. Such risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Commodity Price Risk: In the normal course of business, the Companys utility and non utility power generation subsidiaries utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of electricity. This is done to effectively manage utilization of their available generating capacity and energy during periods when available power resources are expected to exceed the requirements of their obligations. This practice may also include forward contracts for the purchase of power during periods when the anticipated market price of electric energy is below expected incremental power production costs. The Company manages its fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium, natural gas and fuel oil. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. On a prospective basis, if cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted, subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery of natural gas costs for the gas utility operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For additional information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities gas cost recovery mechanisms, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. Regulatory Recovery Risk: The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in several of its peaking power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal based plants, and the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas in many instances. Wisconsin Electric bears some regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. As noted above, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity. This clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power, and Wisconsin Electric assumes the risks and benefits of fuel cost variances that are within 3% of the base rate. For 2002, 2001 and 2000, actual fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric exceeded base fuel rates by $2.3 million, $0.1 million and $25.9 million, respectively. In 2002 and 2001, the rates included a fuel surcharge. Weather: The rates of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to the winter heating season. The gas revenues of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are sensitive to the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2002, 2001 and 2000, as measured by degree days, may be found above in "Results of Operations". Temperature can also impact demand for electricity in regions where the Company has invested in non utility energy assets or projects. In addition, to the extent weather conditions incurred in various regions are extreme rather than normal or mild the manufacturing segment demand for products can be impacted. Interest Rate Risk: The Company, including its affiliates, has various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. Wisconsin Energy also has variable rate long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002. Borrowing levels under such arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. The Company performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2002 of its outstanding portfolio of $953.1 million short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.51% and $176.6 million of variable rate 51 long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.88%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause the Companys annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $9.5 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $1.8 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. On September 24, 2002, Wisconsin Energy entered into a treasury lock agreement in order to mitigate Wisconsin Energys interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. This treasury lock agreement locked in the underlying Treasury yield for $100 million of an anticipated $200 million debt issuance expected by the end of the first quarter 2003. Under a treasury lock agreement, Wisconsin Energy agrees to pay or receive an amount equal to the difference between the net present value of the cash flows for the notional amount of the instrument based on: a) the yield of a U.S. treasury bond at the date when the agreement is established and b) the yield of a U.S. treasury bond at the date when the agreement is settled, which typically coincides with the debt issuance. The treasury rate lock agreement was entered into with a major financial institution in order to minimize counterparty credit risk. Marketable Securities Return Risk: The Company funds its pension, other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market price of the assets in these trust funds can affect future pension, other postretirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Future annuity payments to these trust funds can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. Wisconsin Energy expects that the risk of expense and annuity payment variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by the Companys various utility regulators. However, the Company is currently operating under a PSCW ordered, qualified five year rate restriction period through 2005. For further information about the rate restriction, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. At December 31, 2002, the Company held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments. Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $861.2 Nuclear decommissioning trust fund $550.0 Other postretirement benefits trust funds $137.8 The Company manages its fiduciary oversight of the pension and other postretirement plan trust fund investments through a Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. The Company conducts asset/liability studies periodically through an outside investment advisor. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments is also the responsibility of the Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. An asset/liability study is periodically conducted by an outside investment advisor, subject to additional constraints established by the PSCW. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% in equities. The allocation to equities is expected to be reduced as the date for decommissioning Point Beach Nuclear Plant approaches in order to increase the probability of sufficient liquidity at the time the funds will be needed. Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited ("NEIL"). Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment results and determines the feasibility of granting a distribution to policyholders. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs, or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs or decreased distributions to Wisconsin Electric. Non Utility Wholesale Price Risk: The Company is exposed to non utility wholesale price risks in the operations of its non utility segment. Some of the markets in which the Company operates non utility energy generation assets have become oversaturated. The Company has experienced a decline in capacity contracts in these markets. The Company uses diversification in its portfolio of businesses to reduce its exposure to wholesale electric price fluctuations. 52 Independent Power Project ("IPP") Market Risk: Prior to the September 2000 Power the Future strategic announcement, the Company made significant commitments to develop, build and own non utility power plants. Subsequent to September 2000, the Company made significant progress in exiting many of these projects, which resulted in gains during 2001 and 2000 and losses in 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $350 million of investments in non utility energy assets. Management believes that the projected cash flows from these investments over the life of these assets will exceed the recorded carrying value. However, the market value of some of these investments is currently believed not to exceed cost. In the fourth quarter of 2001 and continuing into 2002, the IPP market experienced a significant decline driven by several factors, including the softening economy, the financial viability of energy companies with large IPP investments, lo wer forward electric price curves and a significant tightening of credit to this market. These factors may adversely impact the timing, proceeds and the gain or loss on future sales of non utility energy assets. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk: The Company manages foreign currency market risks through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments. The Company uses forward exchange contracts and other activities to hedge the U.S. dollar value resulting from anticipated foreign currency transactions. The notional amount of these contracts is not significant to the Company. The Company generally uses natural hedges to minimize exposures to the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys net exposure at December 31, 2002 was immaterial. Economic Risk. The Company is exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy for the utility energy segment and worldwide economic trends for the manufacturing segment. The Company uses diversification in its portfolio of businesses to reduce its exposure to economic fluctuations. Inflationary Risk: The Company continues to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the impacts on the Companys medical and post retirement benefit plans, the Company has expectations of low to moderate inflation. Wisconsin Energy does not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on its future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see "Cautionary Factors" below. RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission ("MPSC") regulates retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. Wisconsin Jurisdiction WICOR Merger Order: As a condition of its March 2000 approval of the WICOR acquisition, the PSCW ordered a five year rate restriction period in effect freezing electric and natural gas rates for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas effective January 1, 2001. The Company may seek biennial rate reviews during the five year rate restriction period limited to "carve out" changes in revenue requirements as a result of: Governmental mandates; Abnormal levels of capital additions required to maintain or improve reliable electric service; and Major gas lateral projects associated with approved natural gas pipeline construction projects. To the extent that natural gas rates and rules need to be modified during the integration of the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, the Companys total gas revenue requirements are to remain revenue neutral 53 under the merger order. In its order, the PSCW found that electric fuel cost adjustment procedures as well as gas cost recovery mechanisms would not be subject to the five year rate restriction period and that it was reasonable to allow the Company to retain efficiency gains associated with the merger. A full rate review will be required by the PSCW at the end of the five year rate restriction period. Wisconsin Electric Power Company: The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of recent rate changes, primarily in the Wisconsin jurisdiction, authorized by regulatory commissions for Wisconsin Electrics electric, natural gas and steam utilities. See "Rates and Regulatory Matters" above for the web site addresses where the related rate orders can be found. Incremental Annualized Authorized Revenue Percent Return on Increase Change Common Effective Service Wisconsin Electric (Decrease) in Rates Equity Date (Millions) (%) (%) Retail electric, WI (a) $48.1 3.2% 10/22/02 Retail electric, MI (b) $3.2 7.8% 11.0% 9/16/02 Fuel electric, MI $1.6 3.8% 1/01/02 Retail gas (c) $3.6 0.9% 12.2% 12/20/01 Fuel electric, WI (d) $20.9 1.4% 5/03/01 Fuel electric, WI (d) $37.8 2.5% 2/09/01 Fuel electric, MI $1.0 2.4% 1/01/01 Retail electric, WI $27.5 1.8% 12.2% 1/01/01 Retail electric, WI (e) $11.3 0.8% 12.2% 8/30/00 Retail gas (e) ($3.6) (0.9)% 12.2% 8/30/00 Retail electric, WI (e) $25.2 1.7% 12.2% 4/11/00 Retail gas (e) $11.6 3.1% 12.2% 4/11/00 (a) In October 2002, the PSCW issued its order authorizing a surcharge for recovery of $48.1 million of annual estimated incremental costs associated with the formation and operation of the ATC. The additional revenues will be offset by additional transmission costs. (b) In September 2002, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual electric retail rate increase of $3.2 million for Wisconsin Electric. In addition, the September 2002 order issued by the MPSC authorized the Company to include the transmission costs from ATC prospectively in its Power Supply Cost Recovery clause. (c) In November 2001, the Milwaukee County Circuit Court overturned the PSCWs August 2000 final order for natural gas rates and the PSCW reinstated the higher April 2000 interim gas rate order, effective December 2001. (d) The February 2001 order was an interim order that was effective until the May 2001 final order was issued by the PSCW. The final May 2001 order superceded the February 2001 interim order. (e) The April 2000 order was an interim order that was effective until the August 2000 final order was issued by the PSCW. The retail gas August 2000 final order was amended in the December 2001 Order. In March 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics request for interim price increases related to the 2000/2001 biennial period, authorizing a $25.2 million (1.7%) increase for electric operations and an $11.6 million (3.1%) increase for gas operations. The interim increase, which was subject to potential refund, became effective in April 2000. Rates in the interim order were based upon a 12.2% return on common equity. In August 2000, the PSCW issued its final order in the 2000/2001 pricing proposal. The final order authorized a $36.5 million (2.5%) increase for electric operations (or $11.3 million higher than authorized in the interim order) as well as an $8 million (2.1%) increase for gas operations (or $3.6 million lower than authorized in the interim order). Wisconsin Electric refunded to gas customers revenues that resulted from the difference in gas rates between the interim and final orders. In its August 2000 final order, the PSCW authorized a second $27.5 million (1.8%) 54 increase for electric operations effective in January 2001. Rates in the final order were based upon a 12.2% return on common equity. In November 2000, Wisconsin Electric filed a petition for judicial review with the Milwaukee County Circuit Court challenging the PSCWs decision to limit the final gas rate increase to $8.0 million rather than the $11.6 million found reasonable for the interim increase. In November 2001 the Milwaukee County Circuit Court ruled in Wisconsin Electrics favor and remanded the case back to the PSCW for action. The PSCW did not challenge the courts decision and authorized the Company to increase natural gas rates by $3.6 million effective in December 2001. In its final order related to the 2000/2001 biennial period, the PSCW authorized recovery of revenue requirements for, among other things, electric reliability and safety construction expenditures as well as for nitrogen oxide ("NOx") remediation expenditures. Revenue requirements for electric reliability and safety construction expenditures were subject to refund at the end of 2001 to the extent that actual expenditures were less than forecasted expenditures included in the final order. During 2002, the Company accrued a $1.1 million refund liability associated with the electric safety and reliability spending requirements subject to PSCW review and future resolution. In March 2000, the PSCW had previously authorized all Wisconsin utilities to depreciate NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period. Due to the uncertainty regarding the level and timing of these expenditures, the PSCW, in its final order, required Wisconsin Electric to estab lish escrow accounting for the revenue requirement components associated with NOx expenditures. Wisconsin Electrics actual NOx remediation expenditures resulted in an under spent balance of approximately $11.9 million in the escrow account at the end of 2002. The NOx escrow balance will be impacted by future NOx expenditures and rate making activities. The Company has the ability to request biennial rate reviews for certain "carve out" items. The Company is currently evaluating the need for regulatory relief for the year beginning January 1, 2004. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: In September 2001, Wisconsin Electric requested that the PSCW approve $58.8 million of annual rate relief to recover the estimated incremental costs associated with the formation and operation of ATC, which was designed to enhance transmission access and increase electric system reliability and market efficiency in the state of Wisconsin. Wisconsin Electric was also seeking to recover associated incremental transmission costs of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc., the multi state organization that will monitor and control electric transmission throughout the Midwest. These increased costs are primarily due to the implementation of capital improvement projects for the period 2001 2005 and associated operation costs that are expected to increase transmission capacity and reliability. The Company anticipates that cost recovery of the transmission related costs under this request and similar requests in t he Michigan jurisdiction will be earnings neutral subject to approval of these requests by the PSCW and MPSC. In October 2002, the PSCW issued its order authorizing a surcharge for recovery of $48 million of annual costs reflecting lower projected transmission costs through 2005 than estimated by the Company. Recognizing the uncertainty of these transmission related costs, the PSCW order authorized a four year escrow accounting treatment such that rate recovery will ultimately be trued up to actual costs plus a return on the unrecovered costs. The October 2002 order is expected to increase annual revenues and operating costs by $48 million, with an insignificant impact to net earnings. Wisconsin Gas Company: Wisconsin Gas rates were set within the framework of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism, which was established in 1994 and expired on October 31, 2001. Under this mechanism, Wisconsin Gas had the ability to raise or lower margin rates within a specified range on a quarterly basis. Currently, Wisconsin Gas rates recover $1.5 million per year less than the maximum amount allowed by the PSCWs rate order. Pursuant to that PSCW directive, Wisconsin Gas rates remain at the same levels as were set prior to the expiration of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism. In October 2002, the PSCW issued an order which eliminated escrow accounting for bad debts effective October 1, 2002. Under escrow accounting Wisconsin Gas expensed amounts included in rates for bad debt expense. If actual bad debt costs exceeded amounts allowed in rates, such amounts were deferred as a regulatory asset. The escrow amount accumulated at September 30, 2002 of approximately $6.9 million is expected to be collected in future rates, but future bad debt expense at Wisconsin Gas will no longer be subject to this separate true up mechanism. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: As previously reported, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and 55 purchase power contracts. In December 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application with the PSCW seeking a $51.4 million increase in rates on an expedited basis to recover increased costs of fuel and purchased power in 2001. Wisconsin Electric revised its projected power supply cost shortfall in January 2001 to reflect updated natural gas cost projections for 2001. This update resulted in a request for an additional $11.1 million in 2001, bringing the total requested increase to $62.5 million. Hearings on this matter were held in mid January 2001. In February 2001, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a $37.8 million increase in rates for 2001 power supply costs. Hearings on the final phase of the case were held in late March and early April 2001. The PSCW issued a final order in May 2001, effective immediately, authorizing a total increase in rates of $58.7 million (or an additional $20.9 million over the interim order). Under the final order, Wisconsin Electric would have to refund to customers any over recoveries of fuel costs as a result of the surcharges authorized in 2001. During 2002 and 2001, the Company did not over recover fuel costs. During the second quarter of 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing new fuel cost adjustment rules to be implemented in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction. The new rules will not be effective for Wisconsin Electric until January 2006, the end of a five year rate freeze associated with the WICOR Merger Order. Until such time, Wisconsin Electric will operate under an approved transaction mechanism similar to the old fuel cost adjustment procedure. In addition, as previously reported, on June 4, 2001, two consumer advocacy groups petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for review of decisions related to authorization by the PSCW for Wisconsin Electric to add a surcharge to its electric rates to recover its expected 2001 power supply costs. The petitioners alleged that the PSCW made various material errors of law and procedure as a result of which the Court should set aside both interim and final orders and remand the case to the PSCW. The case was settled and, in May 2002, the Dane County Circuit Court issued a final order dismissing the petition. In February 2003, Wisconsin Electric completed a power supply cost analysis which included updated natural gas cost projections for 2003. Based on this analysis, in February 2003 the Company filed a request with the PSCW to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by $55.0 million annually to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. Under the current fuel cost adjustment procedure, Wisconsin Electric expects to receive an interim order from the PSCW authorizing an increase in electric rates in March 2003. The interim order would be subject to refund pending the PSCW audit and final order later in the year. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: As a result of the acquisition of WICOR by Wisconsin Energy, the PSCW required similar gas cost recovery mechanisms ("GCRM") for the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and for Wisconsin Gas. In recent years, Wisconsin Electric had operated under a modified dollar for dollar GCRM, which included after the fact prudence reviews by the PSCW, while the Wisconsin Gas GCRM included an incentive mechanism that provides an opportunity for Wisconsin Gas to increase or decrease earnings within certain limited ranges as a result of gas acquisition activities and transportation costs. For both companies, the majority of gas costs are passed through to customers under their existing gas cost recovery mechanisms. In February 2001, the PSCW issued an order to Wisconsin Electric and to Wisconsin Gas authorizing a similar GCRM for each company. These new GCRMs, which were effective in April 2001, are similar to the existing GCRM at Wisconsin Gas. Under the new GCRMs, gas costs are passed directly to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause. However, both companies have the opportunity to increase or decrease earnings by up to approximately 2.5% of their total annual gas costs based upon how closely actual gas commodity and capacity costs compare to benchmarks established by the PSCW. Recent changes in the benchmarks applied resulted in no significant impact in current earnings under the GCRM in 2002 and 2001 compared to an increase in the earnings for Wisconsin Gas of $3.0 million before tax in 2000. Commodity Price Risk: The gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have commodity risk management programs that have been approved by the PSCW. These programs hedge the cost of natural gas and therefore changes in the value of the financial instruments do not impact net income. These programs allow the Companys gas utilities to utilize call and put option contracts to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchases and gas in storage. Under these programs, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric have the ability to hedge up to 50% of their planned flowing gas and storage inventory volumes. The cost of applicable call and put option contracts, as well as gains or losses realized under the contracts, do not affect net income as they are fully recovered under the purchase gas adjustment clauses of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin 56 Electric gas cost recovery mechanisms. In addition, under the Gas Cost Incentive Mechanism, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric use derivative financial instruments to manage the cost of gas. The cost of these financial instruments, as well as any gains or losses on the contracts, are subject to sharing under the incentive mechanisms. Ixonia Lateral: In April 2002, Wisconsin Gas announced that construction of the 35 mile lateral ("Ixonia Lateral") to connect its distribution system to the Guardian Pipeline would be delayed until the spring of 2003 in order to obtain all permits and easements. On August 30, 2002, Wisconsin Gas filed a request with the PSCW for approval of an increased cost estimate for the Ixonia Lateral. The original cost estimate of $62 million has increased to approximately $97.5 million based on an in service date in the fourth quarter of 2003. On January 15, 2003, Wisconsin Gas received from the WDNR a Chapter 30 permit to construct the Ixonia Lateral after lengthy negotiations with WDNR and interested parties. Wisconsin Gas filed in February 2003 updated cost estimates reflecting additional costs of approximately $14.0 million required by the WDNR permit conditions. The Ixonia Lateral continues to be economically feasible and provides substantial gas cost savings as well as critical additional pipeline capacity. Wisconsin Gas expects to complete and place the Ixonia Lateral in service during the fourth quarter of 2003. In the event that the Ixonia Lateral is not completed prior to November 2003, Wisconsin Gas would incur additional operating costs for gas to be delivered into its service territory. On August 24, 2001, Neighbors Standing United ("NSU"), a landowner group, and an individual landowner, filed petitions for review of the PSCW order dated July 25, 2001, which approved Wisconsin Gas Companys application to construct and operate the Ixonia Lateral. The petitioners allege, among other issues, that the final environmental impact statement ("FEIS") for this pipeline project did not meet applicable legal requirements and that affected landowners due process rights were not satisfied during the PSCW review process. After briefing of the issues and oral argument, the Jefferson County Circuit Court on November 5, 2002, rendered a decision denying the petitions for review and request for injunctive relief with one modification by the Court which narrowed the approved pipeline route corridor from 800 to 200 feet. On December 18, 2002, the landowner filed a Notice of Appeal of the Court decision to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. These two petitioners also filed on February 21 and 22, 2002, respectively, petitions for review of a January 17, 2002, WDNR decision which concluded that the FEIS for the Guardian Pipeline and Ixonia Lateral projects fully complied with the Wisconsin Environmental Policy Act. These petitions for review and associated proceedings have been stayed by the Jefferson County Circuit Court pending resolution of the proceedings for the court review of the PSCWs order. Power the Future Port Washington Order: The PSCW issued its written order on December 20, 2002 granting We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 545 megawatt natural gas based combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington, Wisconsin generating station ("Port Units 1 & 2"). The Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral and ATC to construct required transmission system upgrades to serve the Port Washington station. As part of the Order the PSCW also approved in substance the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain Port Units 1 & 2. Key financial terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with provisions for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt for lease computation purposes; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% on equity for lease calculation purposes; Fixed construction cost of the 2 Port units at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority only over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Order, which do not include the key financial terms. We Power is required to begin construction of Port Unit 1 no later then 12 months after it receives all necessary federal, state and local permits. We Power anticipates commencing construction of Port Unit 1 during the summer of 2003. We Power has entered into binding contracts with third parties to secure necessary engineering, design and construction services and major equipment components for Port Unit 1. Before beginning construction of Port Unit 2, the Order requires that an updated demand and energy forecast be filed with the PSCW to document market 57 demand for additional generating capacity. We Power expects to begin the collection of certain amounts as provided for in the leased generation contracts from Wisconsin Electric in 2003. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to defer such costs for recovery in future rates. Michigan Jurisdiction Wisconsin Electric Power Company: In mid November 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application with the MPSC requesting an electric retail rate increase of $3.7 million or 9.4% on an annualized basis. Hearings on this rate relief request were completed in June of 2001. In December of 2001, the MPSC issued an order reopening the case on a limited basis to incorporate the rate effects of the transfer of Wisconsin Electric transmission assets to ATC. Hearings were completed on April 10, 2002. In September 2002, the MPSC issued its order authorizing an annual electric retail rate increase of $3.2 million effective immediately. On February 20, 2003, International Paper Corporation filed a claim of appeal from the Michigan Public Service Commissions final order in Case No. U 12725, which awarded the Company a $3.2 million rate increase and changed the procedures by which the Company recovers the cost of obtaining transmission services. T he Company believes the Commission will prevail in defense of its order. Edison Sault Electric Company: In September 1995, the MPSC approved Edison Saults application to implement price cap regulation for its electric customers in the state of Michigan, capping base rates at existing levels, rolling its existing fuel cost adjustment procedure or Power Supply Cost Recovery ("PSCR") factor into base rates and suspending its existing PSCR clause. Edison Sault is required to give thirty days notice for rate decreases. The order authorizing Edison Saults price cap represents a temporary experimental regulatory mechanism and allows Edison Sault to file an application seeking an increase in rates under extraordinary circumstances. In October 2000, Edison Sault filed a report with the MPSC addressing its experience under the price cap mechanism. In September 2001, Edison Sault submitted an application to reinstate its PSCR clause in January 2002 and to incorporate therein 2002 incremental ATC charges and certain miscellaneous costs. In October 2001, Edison Sault filed an application with the MPSC to establish its PSCR factor for the year 2002. In April 2002, the MPSC issued orders authorizing Edison Sault to reimplement its PSCR clause, beginning May 1, 2002. PSCR revenues collected during 2002 are subject to a true up hearing. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Consistent with the requests in Wisconsin noted above, both Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault filed requests with the MPSC in September 2001 for rate recovery of estimated 2002 transmission costs over 2001 levels in the amount of $0.3 million for Wisconsin Electric and $0.6 million for Edison Sault through the Michigan Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism. In April 2002, the MPSC issued an order that authorized Edison Sault to reimplement a Power Supply Cost Recovery clause which included the transmission costs from ATC in its determination. In September 2002 the MPSC issued an order that authorized Wisconsin Electric to recover transmission costs in its Power Supply Cost Recovery Clause prospectively. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company filed a separate request with the MPSC for ATC start up and incremental ATC cost deferrals to date that amounted to approximately $1.2 million. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power as a result of modern digital equipment, Wisconsin Energy is evaluating and updating its electric distribution system as part of its enhanced Power the Future strategy. The Company is taking some immediate steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of the Companys existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance the Companys current electric distribution infrastructure. In the long term, Wisconsin Energy is initiating a new distribution system design that is expected to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy, using new technology, advanced communications and a two way electricity flow. Implementation of the Power the Future strategy is subject to a number of state and f ederal regulatory approvals. For additional information, see "Corporate Developments" above. 58 Wisconsin Electric had adequate capacity to meet all of its firm electric load obligations during 2002. All of Wisconsin Electrics generating plants performed well during the hottest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. Public appeals for conservation were not required, nor was there the need to interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates. Deliveries were curtailed on several occasions to certain special contract customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan because of transmission constraints in the area. Wisconsin Electric expects to have adequate capacity to meet all of its firm load obligations during 2003. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require Wisconsin Electric to call upon load management procedures during 2003 as it has in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, Wisconsin Energy faces potentially significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting the Companys utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as carbon dioxide ("CO2"), sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), nitrogen oxide ("NOx"), small particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel, and (5) the eventual decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Wisconsin Energy is currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage its environmental issues including (1) substituting new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of the Power the Future strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) participating in regional initiatives to reduce the emissions of NOx from the Companys fossil fuel based generating facilities, (4) entering into a voluntary multi emission agreement with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury by 45 50%, 60 65%, and 50%, respectively, within 10 years from Wisconsin Electrics coal based power plants in Wisconsin, (5) recycling of ash from coal based generating units and (6) the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see "Nuclear Operations" below and "Note&nbsp ;G Nuclear Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, respectively. National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In July 1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. Although specific emission control requirements are not yet defined and despite legal challenges to these standards that will impact compliance requirements and timing, Wisconsin Electric believes that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from coal based generating facilities. If these new standards withstand ongoing legal challenges, Wisconsin Electric expects that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the ozone attainment standards will be implemented in stages from 2004 through 2012, beginning with the ozone transport reductions described below. Reductions associated with the new particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and extending to the year 2017. Beyond the cost estimates identified below, Wisconsin Electric is currently unable to estimate the impact of the revised air quality standards on its future liquidity, financial condition or results of operation. Ozone Non Attainment Rulemaking: In October 1998, the EPA promulgated ozone transport rules to address transport of NOx and ozone into ozone non attainment areas in the eastern half of the United States. The rules would have required electric utilities in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia, including the state of Wisconsin, to significantly reduce NOx emissions by May 1, 2003. A court decision was issued in March 2000 excluding the state of Wisconsin but continuing to include southern Michigan as one of 19 states in a region east of the Mississippi River that would remain subject to the October 1998 rules. Independent of any court decisions, Wisconsin and some other states in the Lake Michigan region have concluded rulemaking proceedings that require utilities, including Wisconsin Electric, to reduce NOx emissions as part of separate, existing 1 hour ozone attainment demonstration rules required by the EPA for the Lake Michigan regions severe non attainment areas. 59 Michigans and Wisconsins rules are both in effect. Wisconsin Electric currently expects to incur total annual expenditures of $12.7 million to $18.4 million and annual operation and maintenance costs of $1 million during the period 2003 through 2004 to comply with the Michigan and Wisconsin rules. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NOx emission reductions requirements will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPAs July 1997 revisions to the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards discussed above. In January 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics comprehensive plan to meet the Wisconsin regulations, permitting recovery in rates of NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period and requiring that these costs be separately itemized on customer bills. Mercury Emission Control Rulemaking: As required by the 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA issued a regulatory determination in December 2000 that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. The EPA will develop draft rules by December 2003 and issue final rules by December 2004. In June 2001, the WDNR independently developed draft mercury emission control rules that would affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. The draft rules call for 30%, 50% and 90% reductions in mercury air emissions over 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. The draft rules also require offsets for new mercury emitting generating facilities. Wisconsins draft rules have not been finalized and will likely be revised if finalized at some future date. The Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate rules that will be developed and adopted by the EPA or the WDNR, nor is it able to predict the impacts, if any, that the EPAs and WDNRs mercury emission control rulemaki ngs might have on the operations of its existing or potential coal based generating facilities. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see "Note R Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its combustion byproducts. For further information, see "Note R Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Manufacturing Segment: WICOR Industries has provided reserves sufficient to cover its estimated costs related to known contamination associated with its manufacturing facilities. EPA Information Requests: Wisconsin Electric and Wisvest Connecticut LLC., formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisvest, each received requests during 2001 for information from the EPA regional offices pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information, see "Note R Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LEGAL MATTERS Giddings & Lewis Inc./City of West Allis Lawsuit: In July 1999, a jury issued a verdict against Wisconsin Electric awarding the plaintiffs $4.5 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages in an action alleging that Wisconsin Electric had deposited contaminated wastes at two sites in West Allis, Wisconsin owned by the plaintiffs. In September 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned the $100 million punitive damage award and remanded the punitive damage claim back to the lower court for retrial. In January 2002, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs petition for review. Plaintiffs claims were settled during 2002 for a total cost of $17.3 million. For further information, see "Note R Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Other: Wisvest has an investment of approximately $30 million in a cogeneration plant in the State of Maine, called Androscoggin Energy LLC which is operated by a third party. Androscoggin has an energy services agreement with a customer which receives steam from the cogeneration plant. The customer has filed a lawsuit against Androscoggin alleging breach of the energy services agreement. In November 2002, a federal judge awarded partial summary judgment to the customer against Androscoggin. A trial will be scheduled in 2003 for the determination of damages to be awarded, if any, under the claim. This dispute could significantly impair the Companys investment in Androscoggin. 60 NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric owns two 510 megawatt electric generating units at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin which are operated by Nuclear Management Company, LLC ("NMC"), a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, Point Beach provided 22%, 25% and 23% of Wisconsin Electrics net electric energy supply, respectively. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") operating licenses for Point Beach expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. In July 2000, Wisconsin Electrics senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both units at Point Beach. Subject to approval by the PSCW and a decision to relicense the units, the project may be completed by May 2007 and could add approximately 90 megawatts of electrical output to Point Beach. NMC has formed an operating license renewal team which is expected to complete a technical and economic evaluation of license renewal by mid 2003. Based upon the results of this evaluation and subject to approval by executive management and by the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Electric will determine whether to seek appropriate regulatory approvals, including submittal of an application to the NRC, in early 2004 for an extension of the operating licenses for Point Beach Nuclear Plant for a period of up to 20 years. In August 2001, the NRC issued Bulletin 2001 01, Circumferential Cracking of Reactor Pressure Vessel Head Penetration Nozzles, requesting that pressurized water reactor licensees provide information on the structural integrity of the subject nozzles. NMC responded that tests and inspections conducted at Point Beach over the last several years had not identified any evidence of such cracking. NMC conducted more thorough inspections of the reactor pressure vessel head and nozzles during the Spring 2002 Unit 2 refueling outage and found no indications of degradation. On August 9, 2002, NRC issued Bulletin 2002 02, "Reactor Pressure Vessel Head and Vessel Head Penetration Nozzle Inspection Programs," providing additional NRC expectations for reactor vessel head examinations. As a result of this new NRC guidance, NMC conducted more extensive examinations of the Unit 1 reactor pressure vessel head during the Fall 2002 refueling outage. The results of these examinations were also acceptable. The Company plans to replace both reactor vessel heads during the 2005 refueling outages as an alternative to incurring the additional time and costs of these examinations. The estimated cost of this capital expenditure is approximately $40 million in 2002 dollars. On July 12, 2002, the NRC issued a Notice of Violation and provided its final significance determination, upholding its April 8, 2002 preliminary red finding for Point Beach related to a potential failure of the plants auxiliary feedwater system under certain postulated accident scenario analyses. In November 2001, as part of a comprehensive risk assessment, plant employees discovered the potential for a common mode failure of the plants auxiliary feedwater pumps. The matter was immediately reported to the NRC and prompt interim corrective actions were implemented. Point Beach has completed equipment modifications and updated its procedures to ensure operators have explicit guidance that matches training and to ensure plant personnel take appropriate actions when necessary. The NRC conducted an inspection in September 2002 to gather additional information. On October 2, 2002, the NRC determined that treatment as an old design issue not representative of current performance is appropriate. However, NRCs consideration of this finding in their assessment of Point Beachs current overall performance is presently on hold pending final resolution of a subsequent issue involving the plants auxiliary feedwater system. On October 24, 2002, while conducting post maintenance testing, plant employees discovered the potential for another common mode failure mechanism under specific conditions for the plants auxiliary feedwater pumps. The matter was immediately reported to the NRC and prompt interim corrective actions were implemented. Analysis and evaluation of the susceptibility of the auxiliary feedwater system to this failure mode, assessment of the safety significance of this postulated condition, and interactions with NRC to achieve appropriate resolution are continuing. The Company is currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, that may result. Nuclear Insurance: The Price Anderson Act, as amended and extended to August 1, 2002, currently limits the total public liability for damages arising from a nuclear incident at a nuclear power plant. A provision extending the Price Anderson Act through the end of 2003 was adopted by Congress in February 2003. 61 Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During 1995, Wisconsin Electric completed construction of a facility at Point Beach for the temporary dry storage of up to 48 canisters containing used nuclear fuel. During 2000, Wisconsin Electric finished loading the last of twelve canisters originally authorized by the PSCW. On March 13, 2001, the PSCW approved a May 2000 application for authority to load additional temporary used fuel dry storage containers. The application requested authorization for sufficient additional containers, at a cost of up to approximately $46 million, to operate Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to the end of their current operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the facility. NMC is under contract with a new vendor to supply the next generation of used fuel dry storage containers for Point Beach. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the United States Department of Energy takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987 (the "Waste Act"). Effective January 31, 1998, the Department of Energy failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $185.3 million over the life of the plant. The Department of Energy has indicated that it does not expect a permanent used fuel repository to be available any earlier than 2010. It is not possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the Department of Energy will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel. On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the Department of Energys failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach in the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the Department of Energy in the Court of Federal Claims. The matter is pending. As of December 2002, Wisconsin Electric has incurred damages in excess of $35 million, which it seeks to recover from the United States Department of Energy. Damages continue to accrue, and, accordingly, Wisconsin Electric expects to seek recovery of its damages in this lawsuit. In January 2002, as required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Secretary of Energy notified the Governor of Nevada and the Nevada Legislature that he intended to recommend to the President that the Yucca Mountain site is scientifically sound and suitable for development as the nations long term geological repository for used nuclear fuel. On February 14, 2002, the Secretary provided the formal recommendation to the President. In a February 2002 letter to Congress, the President expressed his support for the development of the Yucca Mountain site. The letter also affirmed the need for a permanent repository by supporting the need for nuclear power and its cost competitiveness, as well as acknowledging that successful completion of the repository program will redeem the clear Federal legal obligation set forth in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. On April 8, 2002, the Nevada Governor announced the states official disapproval of the Presidents recommendation. On May 8, 2002, the U.S. Ho use of Representatives endorsed the Presidents recommendation to develop the Yucca Mountain site as the nations long term geological repository for used nuclear fuel overriding the state of Nevadas objections. On July 9, 2002, the U.S. Senate approved Yucca Mountain as such a repository. The President signed the resolution on July 23, 2002 which now clears the way for the U.S. Department of Energy to begin preparation of the application to the NRC for a license to design and build the repository. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry Across the United States, electric industry restructuring progress has generally stalled subsequent to the California price and supply problems in early 2001. States that had restructured and implemented retail access before the California problems generally have not gone back to traditional regulation. Several states (Arkansas, Montana, New Mexico and Oklahoma) have delayed retail access or plan to implement limited retail access (Nevada and Oregon). Texas and Michigan implemented restructuring by offering retail access on January 1, 2002. FERC has come out strongly supporting large Regional Transmission Organizations ("RTOs") which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. The timeline for restructuring and retail access has been stretched out, and it is uncertain when retail access will happen in Wisconsin. There are many federal bills on electric industry restructuring currently before the U.S. House and Senate. These bills are receiving some attention, but the direction is not cl ear as both the House and Senate do not appear to have developed a strong vision of where they want the industry to go. Major 62 issues in industry restructuring are: deregulating existing generation, unbundling transmission and generation from distribution costs, implementing RTOs, and market power mitigation. This list of issues is not all inclusive, nor do all items need to be accomplished by a "date certain." The Company continues to focus on infrastructure issues through its Power the Future growth strategy. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, Wisconsin is proceeding with restructuring of the electric utility industry at a much slower pace than many other states in the United States. Instead, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin such as: Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; The previously described formation of a statewide transmission company, American Transmission Company LLC, which became operational January 1, 2001; and Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: Electric utility revenues are regulated by the MPSC. In June 2000, the Governor of Michigan signed the "Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act" into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. The new law provides that as of January 1, 2002 all Michigan retail customers of investor owned utilities have the ability to choose their electric power producer. The Michigan Retail Access law was characterized by the Michigan Governor as "Choice for those who want it and protection for those who need it." As of January 1, 2002, Michigan retail customers of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault have maintained their generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as they have in the past. Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in the companies service territories in Michigan has been limited. No alternate supplier activity has occurred in the companies service territories in Michigan, reflecting the small market area, the companies competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Restructuring in Illinois: In 1999, the state of Illinois passed legislation that introduced retail electric choice for large customers and introduced choice for all retail customers in May 2002. This legislation is not expected to have a material impact on Wisconsin Electrics business. Wisconsin Electric has one wholesale customer in Illinois, the City of Geneva, whose contract is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. However, Wisvests wholly owned subsidiary, Calumet Energy Team, LLC, does compete in the Illinois electric generation market with power produced from its 308 MW gas based peaking plant that entered commercial operation in 2002. Wisconsin Energy believes that the Illinois choice legislation will not materially affect Calumet Energys operating results. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW has instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To 63 date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on the Companys results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS 123." This statement amends SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company does not intend to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148. In January 2003, the FASB authorized issuance of Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Interpretation 46, which is effective for interim periods beginning after June 15, 2003, which requires companies with variable interests in variable interest entities to evaluate whether they must consolidate these entities subject to the provisions included in Interpretation 46. The Interpretation must be applied to any existing interests in variable interest entities beginning in the third quarter of 2003. The Company does not expect to consolidate any existing interest in unconsolidated entities as a result of Interpretation 46. The Company expects to begin application of this Interpretation July 1, 2003. In October 2000, the FASB issued two exposure drafts: Accounting for Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities, Equity, or Both, and Proposed Amendment to FASB 6 to Revise the Definition of Liabilities. In March 2003, the FASB is expected to authorize issuance of SFAS 149, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity, which is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, requiring classification of mandatorily redeemable instruments as liabilities. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 149 effective July 1, 2003. The Company will reclassify its mandatorily redeemable instruments to long term debt upon adoption of SFAS 149. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Wisconsin Energys financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Regulatory Accounting: Wisconsin Energys utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may result in future utility prices which are based upon factors other than the traditional original cost of investment. In such a situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation ("SFAS 71"), may no longer be 64 appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $650.6 million in regulatory assets and $327.2 million in regulatory liabilities. The Company continually reviews the applicability of SFAS 71 and has determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. See "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and Postretirement Plans: The Company has significant pension and postretirement obligations and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and medical trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside the Companys control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: As a result of adoption of SFAS 142 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"), effective January 1, 2002, the Company is required to perform annual assessments of its goodwill for impairment by applying fair value based tests. As of December 31, 2002, Wisconsin Energy had $833 million of goodwill on its balance sheet attributable to the gas utility and manufacturing businesses of WICOR, Inc., which was acquired in April 2000 (see "Note D Mergers and Acquisitions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). To perform its annual impairment test of goodwill, Wisconsin Energy is required to make various assumptions regarding these tests including assumptions about the future profitability of its gas utility and manufacturing operations correlated with published projections for other simi lar businesses. A significant change in these markets, including the market values for similar assets, or in the Companys projections could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss related to a decrease in the goodwill asset. The Company reviewed its goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2002 upon adoption of SFAS 142 and during the third quarter of 2002 as part of its annual test as required by SFAS 142. In both cases, the Company determined that there were no impairments to the recorded goodwill balance for any of its reporting units. Unbilled Revenues: The Company records utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to its customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, line losses and applicable customer rates. Asset Retirement Obligations: Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143"), which requires entities to recognize the estimated fair value of legal liabilities for asset retirements in the period in which they are incurred. SFAS 143 applies primarily to decommissioning costs for the utility energy segments Point Beach Nuclear Plant. Using a discounted future cash flow methodology, the Company estimated that its nuclear asset retirement obligation was approximately $673 million at January 1, 2003. Calculation of this asset retirement obligation is based upon projected decommissioning costs calculated by an independent decommissioning consulting firm as well as several significant assumptions including the timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates, the discount rate applied to future cash flows and an 85% probability of plant relicensing. For additional information concerning adoption of SFAS 143 and the Companys estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation, see "Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements" and "Note G Nuclear Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 CAUTIONARY FACTORS This report and other documents or oral presentations contain or may contain forward looking statements made by or on behalf of Wisconsin Energy.
