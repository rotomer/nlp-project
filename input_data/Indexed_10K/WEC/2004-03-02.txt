ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment, a non utility energy segment and a manufacturing segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, Our, Us or We refer to the holding company and all of our subsidiaries. Our utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Wisconsin Electric) and Wisconsin Gas Company (Wisconsin Gas), both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies", and Edison Sault Electric Company (Edison Sault), is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of W.E. Power, LLC (We Power) and Wisvest Corporation (Wisvest). We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric and other utilities. Our manufacturing segment, which we have agreed to sell, consists of companies which manufacture pumps as well as fluid processing and water filtration equipment.

CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We seek to increase shareholder value by leveraging on the core competencies within our business segments. Our key corporate strategy is Power the Future which was announced in September 2000. This strategy is designed to increase the electric generating capacity in the state of Wisconsin while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It also is designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands, and we are committed to improved environmental performance. Our Power the Future strategy, which is discussed further below, is expected to have a significant impact on our utility and non utility energy segments. Utility Energy Segment: We are realizing operating efficiencies in this segment through the integration of the operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. These operating efficiencies should increase customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. In connection with our Power the Future strategy, we plan to improve the existing energy distribution systems and upgrade existing electric generating assets. Manufacturing Segment: In February 2004, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell this segment to Pentair, Inc., for $850 million and the assumption of approximately $25 million of debt. We expect to realize a gain on the sale of approximately $0.15 $0.20 per share, after taxes, debt redemption costs and transaction costs. We expect the sale to close during the second or third quarter of 2004 subject to regulatory approvals. For further information about the sale see "Capital Resources". Non Utility Energy Segment: We will primarily focus this segment on improving the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power has been formed to design, construct, own, finance and lease new generation assets and 35 make improvements in Wisconsin Electrics existing generation assets under the Power the Future strategy. The majority of Wisvests assets have been divested in order to direct the capital and management attention to Power the Future. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, we filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) starting the regulatory review process for a proposed 10 year strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future strategy is intended to meet the growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Power the Future will add new coal based and natural gas based generating capacity to the states power portfolio and will allow Wisconsin Electric to maintain approximately the same fuel mix as exists today. As part of our Power the Future strategy, we plan to: (1) invest approximately $2.5 billion in 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrade Wisconsin Electrics existing electric generating facilities and (3) invest in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. As of December 31, 2003, we have: Received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the PSCW to build two 545 megawatt natural gas based intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin, with the first unit expected to be in service in July 2005 and the second unit in 2008 subject to resolution of legal challenges; Began construction on the first 545 megawatt generating unit in Port Washington (approximately 14% complete as of January 31, 2004), which is currently on schedule and within budget; and Received a CPCN from the PSCW to build two 615 megawatt coal based base load units at Elm Road in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, with the first unit expected to be in service in 2009 and the second unit in 2010 subject to resolution of legal challenges and receipt of environmental permits. In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own, finance and lease the new generating capacity. Under our Power the Future strategy Wisconsin Electric will lease each new facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or renew the lease. Smaller investor owned or municipal utilities, cooperatives and power marketing associations have the opportunity to own a portion of the coal units, including expanding or extending wholesale power purchases from Wisconsin Electric as a result of the additional electric generating capacity included in the proposal. Wisconsin Electric expects that all lease payments and operating costs of the plants will be recoverable in rates. In February 2001, we made preliminary filings for our Power the Future proposal with the PSCW. Subsequently, the state legislature amended several laws, making changes which are critical to the implementation of Power the Future. On October 16, 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with Power the Future and for us to incur the associated pre certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the PSCW in order to be recovered. Several phases of our Power the Future strategy remain subject to a number of regulatory approvals and legal challenges by third parties. Additional information regarding the regulatory process, specific regulatory approvals and associated legal challenges may be found below under "Rates and Regulatory Matters". We anticipate obtaining the capital necessary to finance and execute Power the Future from a combination of internal and external sources. For further information concerning the Power the Future strategy, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" as well as "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. 36 Divestiture of Non Core Assets The Power the Future strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily included non utility generation assets located outside of the Midwest and a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion from the divestiture of non core assets as follows: Proceeds from: (Millions of Dollars) Non Utility Energy $579.3 Transmission 119.8 Real Estate 349.0 Other 20.6 Total Assets Divested $1,068.7 In February 2004, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our manufacturing segment. The sale, which is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2004, is expected to result in net proceeds of approximately $740 million after taxes and transaction costs. For further information about the sale, see "Capital Resources" below. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment for 2003, 2002 and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $544.1 $562.1 $534.9 Manufacturing 66.9 56.2 41.1 Non Utility Energy (61.5) (132.0) 36.2 Corporate and Other 1.3 (28.3) (7.3) Operating Income 550.8 458.0 604.9 Other Income, net 43.5 43.9 0.6 Financing Costs 214.9 229.2 246.6 Income Before Income Taxes 379.4 272.7 358.9 Income Taxes 135.1 105.7 150.4 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Tax 10.5 Net Income $244.3 $167.0 $219.0 2003 vs 2002: We had net income of $244.3 million during 2003 compared with net income of $167.0 million during 2002. Utility energy operating income decreased when compared with the prior year primarily due to cooler weather during the summer of 2003 as compared to 2002, higher fuel and purchased power costs, and increases in benefit costs, nuclear costs and costs associated with our Power the Future growth strategy. These items were partially offset by higher gas margins, growth in our base electric business and insurance recoveries in 2003 compared to associated settlement costs in 2002, both primarily related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation. Our manufacturing segment contributed operating income of $66.9 million during 2003 compared with $56.2 million during 2002 reflecting strong water systems retail sales, costs in 2002 for plant closings and 37 restructuring and cost reduction efforts. The decrease in the operating loss for our non utility energy segment primarily relates to less asset valuation charges recorded in 2003 as compared to 2002. Corporate and other affiliates operating income increased $29.6 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to a non cash asset valuation charge recorded in 2002, a gain from the liquidation of an investment in 2003, and improved operating results in 2003. In addition, net income increased in 2003 due to lower financing costs compared with 2002. 2002 vs 2001: Our net income was $167.0 million during 2002 compared with net income of $219.0 million during 2001. Operating income for our utility energy segment increased by $27.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to improved electric and gas margins and the adoption of SFAS 142 in 2002, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill, offset in part by litigation settlements and additional expenses related to nuclear operations. Manufacturing operating income was up $15.1 million primarily due to acquisitions, cost savings achieved through consolidation of operations, the continuation of cost improvement programs, and the adoption of SFAS 142, offset by one time costs associated with consolidation of facilities in the first quarter of 2002. The decrease in operating income for our non utility energy segment is due to a non cash asset valuation charge recorded in 2002 and a decline in wholesale market prices partially offset by SFAS 133 gains. Corporate and other affiliates operating income decreased $21.0 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to an asset valuation charge offset in part by gains on asset sales and elimination of goodwill amortization. In addition, the decline in net income was offset in part due to higher other income, a reduction in financing costs and a lower effective income tax rate in 2002 compared with 2001. An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment follows. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2003 vs 2002: Utility energy segment operating income during 2003 decreased by $18.0 million to $544.1 million compared to 2002 operating income. The decline in utility operating income is primarily due to cooler summer weather, higher fuel and purchased power costs, increases in pension, medical and other benefit costs, higher nuclear costs and costs associated with our Power the Future growth strategy. This decline was somewhat mitigated by a March 2003 rate increase associated with fuel and purchased power expenses, higher gas margins, growth in our base electric business and litigation settlements in 2002 compared with the receipt of insurance recoveries in 2003 primarily related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation. 2002 vs 2001: Operating income for our utility energy segment increased by $27.2 million or 5.1% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase is primarily attributable to improved electric and gas margins and adoption of SFAS 142 which eliminated amortization of goodwill. Offsetting these items were 2002 litigation settlements related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation and additional expenses related to nuclear operations. 38 The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2003 and 2002 with similar information for 2001. Utility Energy Segment 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,013.6 $1,910.8 1,867.4 Gas 1,226.1 918.1 1,074.5 Other 24.2 23.2 22.9 Total Operating Revenues 3,263.9 2,852.1 2,964.8 Fuel and Purchased Power 569.5 496.7 517.3 Cost of Gas Sold 863.3 574.9 751.6 Gross Margin 1,831.1 1,780.5 1,695.9 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 891.0 830.2 765.5 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 316.2 308.3 320.1 Property and Revenue Taxes 79.8 79.9 75.4 Operating Income $544.1 $562.1 $534.9 Electric Utility Revenues, Gross Margins and Sales The following table compares our electric utility operating revenues and its gross margin during 2003 with similar information for 2002 and 2001. Electric Revenues and Gross Margin Megawatt Hour Sales Electric Utility Operations 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands) Operating Revenues Residential $715.5 $703.0 $654.5 8,099.3 8,310.9 7,773.4 Small Commercial/Industrial 642.0 606.3 592.9 8,740.6 8,719.5 8,595.4 Large Commercial/Industrial 519.3 483.1 479.7 11,401.8 11,129.6 11,177.6 Other Retail/Municipal 84.9 77.7 70.6 2,225.9 2,051.9 1,828.6 Resale Utilities 24.0 18.1 56.8 715.8 650.7 1,687.6 Other Operating Revenues 27.9 22.6 12.9 Total Operating Revenues 2,013.6 1,910.8 1,867.4 31,183.4 30,862.6 31,062.6 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 298.5 278.9 308.8 Purchased Power 264.3 211.1 202.3 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 562.8 490.0 511.1 Gross Margin $1,450.8 $1,420.8 $1,356.3 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,721 Normal) 7,063 6,551 6,338 Cooling (728 Normal) 606 897 711 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2003 vs 2002: During 2003, total electric utility operating revenues increased by $102.8 million or 5.4% when compared with 2002 primarily due to the impact of rate increases related to fuel and purchased power costs and to a surcharge related to transmission costs. The total rate impact was approximately $83.3 million in 2003. In March 2003, Wisconsin Electric received an interim increase in rates of $55.1 million annually to recover increases in fuel 39 and purchased power costs. In October 2003, we received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $6.1 million of annual revenues (see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below). In spite of the interim fuel order, we under recovered fuel costs by approximately $7.6 million during 2003, which is approximately $5.3 million worse than our under recovery during 2002. Much of our under recovery of fuel costs during 2003 can be attributed to the need to purchase replacement power due to a flood at Presque Isle Power Plant in May and June of 2003 and to high natural gas prices. The impact of unfavorable summer weather in 2003 reduced electric operating revenues by approximately $19.0 million between the comparative periods. Total electric megawatt hour sales increased by 1.0% during 2003. Residential sales fell 2.5% due to the impact of unfavorable weather conditions on cooling load during the second and third quarters of 2003. Residential customers contribute higher margins than other customer classes and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in weather. Sales to Wisconsin Electrics largest customers, two iron ore mines, increased by 238.4 thousand megawatt hours or 12.1% between the comparative periods despite temporary curtailments of electric sales in the second and fourth quarters of 2003 resulting from a flood related outage at our Presque Isle Power Plant and a transmission outage. During the first and third quarters of 2002, the mines had extended outages. Excluding these two mines, our total electric energy sales increased by 0.3% and sales volumes to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers improved by 0.4% between the comparative periods. Sales to municipal utilities, the other retail/m unicipal customer class, increased 8.5% between the periods due to a higher off peak demand from municipal wholesale power customers. Total fuel and purchased power expenses increased due in large part to increases in fuel prices, especially for natural gas, the primary fuel source for our purchased power, resulting in a 14% increase in the cost per megawatt hour of purchased power. Average commodity gas market prices were $5.39 for 2003 compared to $3.22 for 2002 on a per dekatherm basis. Fuel and purchased power costs also increased due to higher purchased capacity costs and a higher need for purchased energy in 2003 compared with the same period in 2002. Approximately $9 million of this increase was caused by the flood that temporarily shut down our Presque Isle Power Plant during the second quarter of 2003. Electric gross margin increased 2.1% to $1,450.8 million between the comparative periods. The increase is primarily related to implementing a PSCW approved surcharge in October 2002 for recovery of increased annual transmission costs associated with American Transmission Company LLC (ATC), which increased year to date 2003 gross margin by approximately $39.4 million. Non fuel operation and maintenance costs increased by a similar amount, so there was little impact to Operating Income as a result of the transmission surcharge. Excluding the surcharge, electric gross margin fell by $9.4 million primarily due to the impact of cooler summer weather and higher fuel and purchased power costs compared to the prior year. 2002 vs 2001: During 2002, our total electric utility operating revenues increased by $43.4 million or 2.3% compared with 2001 due to favorable weather, the full year impact of price increases related to fuel and purchased power and a surcharge related to transmission costs. As measured by cooling degree days, 2002 was 26.2% warmer than 2001 and 27.6% warmer than normal. In February and May 2001, Wisconsin Electric received increases in rates to cover increased fuel and purchased power costs. On a year to year basis, the fuel surcharge resulted in $10.0 million of additional revenue. For additional information concerning the rate increases, see "Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Even with the increased fuel revenues, we estimate that we under recovered fuel and purchased power costs by $2.3 million and $0.1 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, total electric energy sales decreased by 0.6% compared with 2001, primarily reflecting a decline in sales for resale to other utilities due to a reduced demand for wholesale power. Most of the remaining customer classes had increased sales in 2002 reflecting favorable weather and the growth in the average number of customers. Sales to Wisconsin Electrics largest commercial/industrial customers, two iron ore mines, declined by 2.8% between the comparative periods due to the shutdown of a mine in the first quarter of 2002. Excluding these mines, total commercial/industrial electric sales increased by 0.8% and sales to the remaining large commercial/industrial customers increased by 0.1% between the comparative periods. Between the comparative periods, fuel and purchased power expenses decreased by $21.1 million or 4.1% primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower wholesale power prices, and lower megawatt sales. These reductions were partially offset by higher costs due to a larger number of planned outages including a second refueling outage at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant during 2002. The lower fuel and purchased power expenses and increased sales to higher 40 margin customers offset the impact on electric revenues of the decline in electric megawatt hours such that the total gross margin on electric operating revenues increased by $64.5 million or 4.8% during 2002 compared with the same period in 2001. Our electric gross margin was $1,420.8 million or 4.8% higher than 2001. The increase is primarily related to the favorable impact of weather and higher fuel cost recovery compared to the prior year. In addition, we implemented a PSCW approved surcharge in October 2002 for recovery of increased annual transmission costs associated with ATC, which increased year to date 2002 gross margin by approximately $8.7 million. Non fuel operation and maintenance costs increased by a similar amount, so there was little impact to Operating Income as a result of the transmission surcharge. Gas Utility Revenues and Gross Margins Gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gas cost recovery mechanisms. The following table compares our gas utility operating revenues and gross margins (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2003 and 2002 with similar information for 2001. Gas Utility Operations 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Gas Operating Revenues $1,226.1 $918.1 $1,074.5 Cost of Gas Sold 863.3 574.9 751.6 Gross Margin $362.8 $343.2 $322.9 2003 vs 2002: During 2003 gas operating revenues increased by $308.0 million or 33.5%. This increase in revenues is due primarily to a $288.4 million increase in the delivered cost of natural gas, recognition of $7.4 million of increased gas cost incentive revenues under our gas cost recovery mechanisms and increased deliveries resulting from colder weather during 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in purchased gas costs is passed on to customers because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gas cost recovery mechanisms. 2002 vs 2001: During 2002, total gas utility operating revenues decreased by $156.4 million or 14.6% compared to 2001, due to lower gas costs offset in part by increased deliveries resulting from colder winter weather. This decline primarily reflects a decrease in natural gas costs in 2002, which are passed on to customers under gas cost recovery mechanisms. 41 Gas Utility Gross Margins and Therm Deliveries The following table compares gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries during 2003, 2002 and 2001. Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions) Customer Class Residential $233.0 $224.6 $209.0 853.7 817.1 756.3 Commercial/Industrial 71.0 67.4 62.3 492.5 463.1 427.7 Interruptible 2.0 2.1 2.0 27.5 29.4 25.8 Total Gas Sold 306.0 294.1 273.3 1,373.7 1,309.6 1,209.8 Transported Gas 41.8 41.9 41.4 797.5 811.7 787.4 Other Operating 15.0 7.2 8.2 Total $362.8 $343.2 $322.9 2,171.2 2,121.3 1,997.2 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,721 Normal) 7,063 6,551 6,338 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2003 vs 2002: Gas gross margin totaled $362.8 million in 2003, or a $19.6 million improvement from 2002. This was directly related to a favorable weather related increase in therm deliveries, especially to residential customers who are more weather sensitive and contribute higher margins per therm than other customer classes. As measured by heating degree days, 2003 was 7.8% colder than 2002 and 5.1% colder than normal. A $7.4 million increase in gas cost incentive revenues during 2003 under our gas cost recovery mechanism also contributed to the increased gross margin between the comparative periods. Total therm deliveries of natural gas increased by 2.4% during 2003 but varied within customer classes. Volume deliveries for the residential and commercial/industrial customer classes increased by 4.5% and 6.3%, respectively, reflecting colder weather. 2002 vs 2001: Gas gross margin for 2002 totaled $343.2 million, or an increase of $20.3 million from 2001. This increase was primarily due to a return to colder winter weather in 2002, which increased the heating degree days compared to 2001. In addition, we had a rate increase which became effective December 20, 2001, which contributed $3.2 million in 2002. The average number of customers also increased in 2002, which favorably impacted the fixed component of operating revenues that is not affected by volume fluctuations. Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses 2003 vs 2002: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $60.8 million or 7.3% during 2003 when compared with 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $39.4 million of higher electric transmission expenses. A surcharge for transmission costs that was approved by the PSCW in October 2002 offset the impact of higher transmission expenses. Pension, medical and other benefit costs increased by approximately $30 million during 2003. Overall, nuclear costs were $8.7 million higher during 2003 compared with 2002 due to an extended outage and costs associated with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) supplemental inspections at Point Beach. Insurance recoveries of approximately $11.1 million in 2003 compared to associated settlement costs of $17.3 million in 2002, both primarily related to the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation, offset some of the increase in other operation and maintenan ce expenses. We spent approximately $7.2 million more in 2003 than 2002 on the implementation of our Power the Future strategy. 2002 vs 2001: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $64.7 million or 8.5% during 2002 compared with 2001. The most significant change in other operation and maintenance expenses between 2002 and 2001 resulted from $17.3 million for the settlements of litigation with the City of West Allis in the second quarter of 2002 and Giddings & Lewis Inc. and Kearney & Trecker Corporation (now part of Giddings & Lewis) in the third quarter of 2002. Increased other operation and maintenance expenses during 2002 were also attributable to 42 $9.8 million of higher electric transmission expenses associated with ATC, which were offset by increased revenues recorded due to the surcharge that became effective in October of 2002, $9.2 million of increased scheduled maintenance at several steam generation plants, and $15.4 million associated with the second scheduled outage and incremental costs associated with reactor vessel head inspections at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in 2002. In 2002, both Point Beach nuclear units had scheduled outages. In 2001, only one nuclear unit had a scheduled outage. We also experienced an increase of $17.4 million for employee benefit and pension costs and $4.8 million in property insurance costs, which were partially offset by cost reduction efforts during 2002. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expenses 2003 vs 2002: Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization expenses increased by $7.9 million or 2.6% during 2003 primarily due to a higher base of depreciable assets between the comparative periods. 2002 vs 2001: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expenses decreased by $11.8 million during 2002 compared with 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the retirement of several shorter lived intangible assets and the adoption on January 1, 2002 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 142 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill. MANUFACTURING SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME During 2003, our manufacturing segment contributed $66.9 million to operating income, which was $10.7 million higher than the prior year amount. Our manufacturing segment contributed $56.2 million to operating income during 2002 compared to $41.1 million during 2001. The following table summarizes our manufacturing segments operating income during 2003, 2002 and 2001. Manufacturing Segment 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Domestic $533.2 $507.6 $444.9 International 212.9 177.6 140.2 Total Operating Revenues 746.1 685.2 585.1 Cost of Goods Sold 557.6 513.2 428.0 Gross Margin 188.5 172.0 157.1 Other Operating Expenses 121.6 115.8 116.0 Operating Income $66.9 $56.2 $41.1 2003 vs 2002: Manufacturing operating revenues for 2003 were $746.1 million, an increase of $60.9 million or 8.9% compared to the same period in 2002. Acquisitions completed in 2002 contributed $10.8 million of sales during 2003. We achieved a 7.3% base business growth level between the comparative periods. During 2003, international sales were 19.9% above the same period in 2002, with approximately half due to international base business growth, mainly in Italy and Mexico, and half relating to currency translation effects. Overall for 2003, sales in all markets of our manufacturing business were up with the exception of the beverage/food, filtration and foam pro markets. The largest growth was seen in the water systems market, which increased 17.0%, due to Hurricane Isabel and wet conditions in the northeastern and midwest sections of the United States coupled with the impact of a 2002 second quarter acquisition, market share growth and the impact from c urrency translation. The pool/spa, agriculture and industrial markets also experienced growth over the prior year sales levels. Our manufacturing gross profit margin increased to $188.5 million for 2003 from $172.0 million in 2002, flat year over year as a percentage of sales. For 2003, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 16.3% from 16.9% for 2002. During 2002, our manufacturing segment recorded charges related to relocation and closing/severance payments, which did not recur in 2003. Excluding these charges, operating expenses as a percentage of sales were flat year over year. 2002 vs 2001: Manufacturing operating revenues increased by $100.1 million or 17.1% between 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions contributed incremental sales of $56.8 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we 43 experienced an 8.0% growth in our manufacturing business. Sales in almost all markets were up with the largest increases in water systems, pool/spa, R/V, and beverage and food markets. Domestic sales were up $62.7 million, and international sales increased $37.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, or 14.1% and 26.7%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2001. The increases were due to acquisitions in 2002 and 2001, market share/customer growth, drought conditions in the United States and Australia, and new product introductions. Gross profit margin decreased to 25.1% in 2002 from 26.9% in 2001 due primarily to changes in the customer/product mix as a result of acquisitions and increased customer rebates due to sales growth. Operating income was up 36.7% primarily due to acquisitions, cost savings achieved through consolidation of operations, the continuation of cost improvement programs, and the adoption of SFAS 142 which eliminated the amortization of good will and certain intangible assets, offset by one time costs associated with consolidation of facilities in the first quarter of 2002. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME As part of our ongoing efforts to divest non core assets, we have significantly reduced Wisvests operations over the past three years. The following table compares our non utility energy segments operating income (loss) during 2003, 2002 and 2001. Non Utility Energy Segment 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $14.4 $167.2 $337.3 Fuel and Purchased Power 1.3 97.3 142.8 Cost of Gas Sold 72.3 Cost of Goods Sold 6.7 Gross Margin 13.1 69.9 115.5 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 16.6 64.9 70.4 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 7.4 5.1 1.7 Property and Revenue Taxes 1.6 6.8 7.2 Asset Valuation Charges, Net 49.0 125.1 Operating Income (Loss) ($61.5) ($132.0) $36.2 2003 vs 2002: The significant decline in operating revenues, fuel and purchased power and other operation and maintenance is directly related to our sale of Wisvest Connecticut in December 2002, which had operating earnings of $16.8 million and $38.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The operating loss incurred in 2003 included total asset valuation charges of $59.5 million offset in part by gains on the sale of assets of $10.5 million. In 2002 we recorded a non cash asset valuation charge of which $125.1 million ($81.3 million after tax) related to the non utility energy segment. (See further discussion below and in "Note D Asset Sales and Divestitures" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report). The asset valuation charges recorded in 2003 relate to our investment in an entity that owns a co generation power plant in Maine (Androscoggin) and costs associated with a 500 megawatt natural gas power island. We determined in the third quarter of 2003 based on information obtained from our efforts to market the power island, that the carrying value of these assets exceeded market values, and the power island was sold at the reduced carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2003. During our 2003 fourth quarter review of updated cash flo w projections for our investment in Androscoggin, management determined a loss in the value of our investment had occurred. We wrote down our investment to its estimated fair value. These charges were offset in part by the sale of our interests in Kaztex Energy Management, Inc. and Blackhawk Energy Services, LLC in which we realized gains of approximately $10.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2003. 2002 vs 2001: Our decrease in non utility energy operating income between 2002 and 2001 can be broken down between operation of the assets and a 2002 asset valuation charge. During 2002, Wisvest Connecticut had operating income of $16.8 million compared to operating income of $38.4 million in 2001. This decline is directly related to 44 lower wholesale market prices for electricity in the northeast United States and an extended unscheduled outage at one of its major generating units from the last half of August through November 2002. In addition, on December 6, 2002, Wisvest completed the sale of Wisvest Connecticut to Public Service Enterprise Group. We Power operations had an operating loss in 2002 primarily related to increased start up costs as it continued to develop power plants for our Power the Future initiative. Wisvests Calumet natural gas based peaking power plant in Chicago, which was placed in service in June of 2002, and the equity method investment in Androscoggin also recorded operating losses during 2002. The Calumet plant experienced start up costs and limited power production due to lower wholesale market prices for electricity in the Midwest during the last six months of 2002. The Androscoggin plant was also negatively impacted by lower than expected wholesale electric prices. During the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non cash asset valuation charge of $125.1 million primarily related to two non utility energy assets classified as "Assets Held for Sale" as of December 31, 2001: the Wisvest Connecticut power plants and costs associated with a 500 megawatt natural gas power island. For more information on the asset valuation charge, see "Note D Asset Sales and Divestitures" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME The following table identifies the components of operating income (loss) of our corporate and other affiliates between 2003, 2002 and 2001. Corporate and Other Affiliates 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $29.9 $31.7 $41.3 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 24.9 37.3 39.3 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 6.1 5.2 7.3 Property and Revenue Taxes 1.0 1.1 2.0 Asset (Gain)/Valuation Charge (3.4) 16.4 Operating Income (Loss) $1.3 ($28.3) ($7.3) 2003 vs 2002: Our corporate and other affiliates recorded operating income of $1.3 million in 2003 compared to an operating loss of $28.3 million in 2002. This is primarily due to a non cash asset valuation charge recorded in 2002 of $16.4 million ($10.7 million after tax) related to the decline in value of a venture capital investment (see further discussion in "Note D Asset Sales and Divestitures" in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this report), and a $2.7 million gain from the sale of investment assets in the third quarter of 2003. 2002 vs 2001: Our operating loss for corporate and other affiliates for 2002 was $21.0 million higher compared to 2001. This increase is primarily related to a non cash asset valuation charge recorded in 2002 of which $16.4 million related to the decline in value of a venture capital investment. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS 2003 vs 2002: Net consolidated other income and deductions decreased by $0.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This decrease is primarily due to $21.1 million ($12.7 million after tax) in SFAS 133 gains recognized in 2002 on fuel oil contracts at Wisvest Connecticuts two power plants, which were sold in December 2002, a $3.2 million civil penalty we agreed to pay in 2003 pursuant to the terms of a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and higher returns associated with investments in rabbi trusts. Also in 2002, we recorded $5.3 million of costs associated with bond redemptions and losses on asset sales of $3.6 million. 2002 vs 2001: Other income and deductions increased by $43.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase is primarily due to $12.6 million in SFAS 133 gains for 2002 compared with charges of $12.7 million in 2001. Under 45 SFAS 133, Wisvest Connecticut recorded the changes in fair market value related to fuel oil contracts associated with its plants in the northeast United States. During 2002, we recorded an after tax gain of $12.6 million on these contracts due to settlement of contract transactions and increases in fuel oil prices. During 2001, we recorded an after tax gain of $10.5 million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon the adoption of SFAS 133 offset by after tax charges of $23.1 million related to settlement of contract transactions and decreases in fuel oil prices. In addition, the 2002 increase included $22.9 million due to a reduction in the level of write downs in the Witech Corporation venture capital portfolio offset in part by a decline in interest income during 2002 of $12.4 million primarily due to an interest accrual recorded in 2001 related to litigation. In addition, during the second quarter of 2001, we sold FieldTech, Inc. and Wisvests interest in Blythe Energy, LLC, an independent power production project in the state of California, in separate transactions. We realized after tax gains of approximately $16.5 million or $0.14 per share as a result of the sales of FieldTech and Blythe. CONSOLIDATED FINANCING COSTS Total financing costs decreased by $14.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. This decline was primarily due to a combination of reduced average debt levels, increased capitalized interest and lower interest rates. Total financing costs decreased by $17.4 million in 2002 compared to 2001. This decline was primarily due to lower interest rates and the early repayment of $103.4 million of long term debt. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES Our consolidated effective income tax rate was 35.6%, 38.8%, and 41.9% for each of the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The reduction in the 2003 effective income tax rate reflects recognition of $3.0 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits associated with rehabilitation projects and a lower state effective income tax rate due to an improving outlook by subsidiaries with the ability to utilize state losses. The lower rate in 2002 reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization and the recognition of historical rehabilitation tax credits. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflects the amortization of the WICOR goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate is negatively impacted by the inability to obtain a state tax benefit for state taxable losses of some of the separate legal entities within the Company. Those state taxable losses result primarily from interest expense. If the prospects for future taxable income for these legal entities should improve, the effective tax rate in years subsequent to 2003 may be favorably impacted. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2003, 2002 and 2001: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $623.9 $711.3 $570.6 Investing Activities ($667.2) ($365.8) ($479.1) Financing Activities $53.2 ($348.9) ($85.0) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $623.9 million during 2003 compared with $711.3 million during the same period in 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a $116 million refund received in the first quarter of 2002 from a favorable court ruling in the Giddings & Lewis/City of West Allis litigation and an increase in the use of working capital in 2003. 46 During 2002, cash flow from operations increased to $711.3 million, or a $140.7 million improvement over 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to the return of a $100 million deposit plus accrued interest as a result of a favorable court ruling discussed above. Investing Activities During 2003, we had capital expenditures totaling $659.4 million, an increase of $102.6 million over the prior year. (see table below for further information). This increase is primarily related to the increased expenditures at We Power associated with the new natural gas power plant. Capital Expenditures 2003 2002 2001 (Millions of Dollars) Regulated Energy $455.6 $405.4 $428.7 We Power 162.9 52.9 Other Non Utility Energy 0.7 39.8 127.7 Manufacturing 10.4 15.0 27.1 Other 29.8 43.7 89.0 Total Capital Expenditures $659.4 $556.8 $672.5 During 2003, we received net cash proceeds from asset sales of approximately $56 million from the sales of our investment in two energy marketing companies, the sale of gas turbines held by Wisvest and from real estate sales. In addition to these proceeds, we received approximately $15 million in dividends from companies that were sold and we expect to receive approximately $32 million in tax benefits from the sale of the Power Island. During 2002 and 2001, we received proceeds from asset divestitures of $310.0 million and $294.4 million, respectively, related to the sale of the Wisvest Connecticut power plants, real estate sales and other small miscellaneous sales in 2002, and the transfer in 2001 of electric transmission assets to ATC, and the successful sale in 2001 of the Wisvest Blythe project, FieldTech, and various real estate sales. Financing Activities During 2003, we provided $53.2 million from financing activities compared with using $348.9 million for financing activities during 2002. We reduced short term debt by $343.2 million and retired $546.7 million of long term debt during 2003. In March 2003, we sold $200 million of unsecured 6.20% Senior Notes due April 1, 2033. These securities were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper as it matured. In May 2003, Wisconsin Electric sold $635 million of unsecured Debentures ($300 million of ten year 4.50% Debentures due 2013 and $335 million of thirty year 5.625% Debentures due 2033) under an existing $800 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Wisconsin Electric used a portion of the proceeds from the Debentures to repay short term debt, which was originally incurred to retire debt that matured in December 2002. The balance of the proceeds were used to redeem $425 million of Wisconsin Electrics debt securities in June 2003 and the early redemption in August 2003 of another $60 million debt issue. The debt refinancings in June and August 2003 are being accounted for using the revenue neutral method of accounting pursuant to PSCW authorization, whereby net debt extinguishment costs in the amount of approximately $18.3 million were deferred and are being amortized over an approximately two year period based upon the level of interest savings achieved. 47 In October 2003, Wisconsin Electric redeemed $9 million of 6.85% First Mortgage Bonds. In December 2003, Wisconsin Gas sold $125 million of unsecured 5.20% Debentures due 2015. These securities were issued under an existing $200 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The proceeds from the Debentures were used to repay short term debt. In September 2000, we initiated a share repurchase program. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased and retired 13.4 million shares through December 31, 2003 at a cost of $293.6 million. In December 2002 the Board of Directors extended the program through December 31, 2004. As part of this program we expect to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock in the open market with proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing segment. During 2003, 2002 and 2001 we issued a total of approximately 2.7 million new shares of common stock in each of the three years in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan and other benefit plans and received payments aggregating $62.9 million, $52.6 million and $51.6 million, respectively. In February 2004, we instructed the plan agents to begin purchasing shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock for our stock plans in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares, and based upon market conditions and other factors the plan agents will continue to do so. During 2001, we refinanced approximately $1.3 billion of commercial paper through the issuance of intermediate term senior notes. In January 2002, Wisconsin Electric redeemed $100 million of 8 3/8% long term debt and $3.4 million of 9 1/8% long term debt. In December 2002, Wisconsin Electric retired $150 million of 6 5/8% debentures at maturity. These redemptions and retirements were financed with short term commercial paper. In 2002, following the sale of Wisvest Connecticut $180.5 million of nonrecourse variable rate notes were paid down. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS As we continue to implement our strategy of leveraging on the core competencies of our business segments and building financial strength, we expect to continue to divest of non core assets, invest in core assets and pay down debt. Capital Resources We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2004 primarily through internally generated funds, short term borrowings, existing lines of credit and the sale of assets, supplemented through the issuance of debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. Beyond 2004, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, through the issuance of debt securities and construction financing. We have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash. On February 4, 2004, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our manufacturing business to Pentair, Inc. for $850 million in cash. In addition, Pentair, Inc. will also assume approximately $25 million of third party debt. This sale is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2004. When the sale is completed, we expect to realize net cash proceeds of approximately $740 million after the payment of taxes and transaction costs. We expect to use the cash proceeds to pay down long and short term debt. In addition, we expect to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock in the open market. Wisconsin Electric has $165 million of unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2003 that were issued as support for a similar amount of variable rate tax exempt bonds issued on its behalf. The terms of the variable rate tax exempt bonds require resetting of the interest rate on a weekly basis and allow holders to put the bonds at par value to the issuer with seven days notice. Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric credit agreements provide 48 liquidity support of Wisconsin Electrics obligations with respect to variable rate tax exempt bonds and commercial paper. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available unused lines of bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis. We had approximately $610 million of total consolidated short term debt outstanding on such date. We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2003: Company Total Facility Drawn Credit Available Facility Maturity Facility Term (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $300.0 $ $300.0 Apr 2004 364 day Wisconsin Energy $300.0 $ $300.0 Apr 2006 3 year Wisconsin Electric $250.0 $ $250.0 Jun 2004 364 day Wisconsin Electric $100.0 $ $100.0 Aug 2004 9 month Wisconsin Gas $200.0 $ $200.0 Jun 2004 364 day On April 8, 2003, we entered into an unsecured 364 day $300 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $300 million credit facility that was expiring. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. On April 8, 2003, we also entered into an unsecured three year $300 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $500 million credit facility that was expiring. This facility will expire in April 2006. On June 25, 2003, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured 364 day $250 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $230 million credit facility that was expiring. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. On December 12, 2003, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured 9 month $100 million bank back up credit facility. On June 25, 2003, Wisconsin Gas entered into an unsecured 364 day $200 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $185 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on December 10, 2003. The credit facility may be extended for an additional 364 days, subject to lender agreement. The following table shows our consolidated capitalization structure at December 31: Capitalization Structure 2003 2002 (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $2,358.6 35.0% $2,139.4 33.5% Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries 30.4 0.5% 30.4 0.5% Trust Preferred Securities % 200.0 3.1% Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 3,741.5 55.5% 3,070.8 48.0% Short Term Debt 609.9 9.0% 953.1 14.9% Total $6,740.4 100.0% $6,393.7 100.0% Effective with the adoption of SFAS 150 on July 1, 2003, we began reclassifying our Trust Preferred Securities as long term debt. Upon adoption of Interpretation 46 on December 31, 2003, we began deconsolidating WEC Capital Trust I, the issuer of our Trust Preferred Securities, and therefore at December 31, 2003 our debt included $206.2 million payable to the trust that issued the Trust Preferred Securities. Our debt, including Trust Preferred 49 Securities, to total capital as of December 31, 2003 was 64.5% as compared to 66.0% as of December 31, 2002. For further information, see "Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Our Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable after March 25, 2004. In February 2004, we called all of the $200.0 million of Trust Preferred Securities. "See Note J Trust Preferred Securities" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. As described in "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities of our subsidiaries by Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Fitch as of December 31, 2003. Commercial paper of WICOR Industries is unrated. S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Unsecured Senior Debt BBB+ A3 A Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Secured Senior Debt A Aa3 AA Unsecured Debt A A1 A+ Preferred Stock BBB A3 A Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A1 A+ Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt BBB+ A3 A WEC Capital Trust I Trust Preferred Securities BBB Baa1 BBB+ In March 2003, S&P lowered its corporate credit ratings on us from A to BBB+ and on Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both from A to A . S&P lowered its ratings on our senior unsecured debt from A to BBB+; on Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt from A to A and on Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt from A to A . S&P affirmed Wisconsin Electrics A senior unsecured debt rating. S&P lowered the rating on our preferred stock from BBB to BBB and on Wisconsin Electrics preferred stock from BBB+ to BBB. S&P affirmed the A 2 short term rating of us and lowered the short term ratings of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from A 1 to A 2. Wisconsin Electrics senior secured and senior unsecured debt are both rated A by S&P. S&P assigned a stable outlook. In October 2003, Moodys downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Moodys lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from A2 to A3 and our commercial paper rating from P 1 to P 2. Moodys lowered the WEC Capital Trust I Trust Preferred Securities rating from A3 to Baa1. Moodys lowered Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt rating from Aa2 to Aa3, senior unsecured debt rating from Aa3 to A1 and preferred stock rating from A2 to A3. Moodys lowered Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt rating from Aa2 to A1. Moodys confirmed the P 1 commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In February 2004, Moodys changed the rating outlook for 50 Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation to stable from negative. The rating outlook for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas is stable. In October 2003, Fitch downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Fitch lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from A to A and the commercial paper rating of Wisconsin Energy from F1 to F2. Fitch lowered the WEC Capital Trust I Trust Preferred Securities rating from A to BBB+. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt rating from AA to AA , senior unsecured rating from AA to A+ and preferred stock rating from AA to A. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt rating from AA to A+. Fitch lowered the commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from F1+ to F1. The rating outlook for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation is stable. We believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Capital Requirements Total capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel, are currently estimated to be $699.2 million during 2004 attributable to the following operating segments: Estimated Actual Capital Expenditures 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $480.1 $455.6 Non Utility Energy We Power 177.8 162.9 Other 2.9 0.7 Manufacturing 22.5 10.4 Other 15.9 29.8 Total $699.2 $659.4 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. Our utility energy segment currently expects capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel and expenditures for new generating capacity contained in our Power the Future strategy described below, to be between $400 million and $500 million per year during the next five years. Our Capital requirements through 2010 for Power the Future include approximately $2.5 billion to construct 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas based and coal based generating capacity of which we have expended approximately $210.8 million through the end of 2003. We expect that two unaffiliated entities will collectively invest approximately $350 million in the Power the Future coal units and receive an ownership interest of approximately 17% in the units or 204 megawatts. Total cost of all four units including the two unaffiliated entities portion is estimated to be $2.8 billion with total output at 2,320 megawatts. We expect capital requirements to support our $2.5 billion of investment in new generation under Power the Future to come from a combination of internal and external sources. With the dividend reduction that began in 2001, we expect to retain almost $90 million per year of additional cash flows, which will provide substantial funding for new generation. We are also divesting non utility assets, which will provide additional cash. The new generating plants will be constructed by We Power, a non utility subsidiary, and leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25 30 year lease 51 agreements. We expect that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. We anticipate that we will need external debt financing as the plants are constructed. However we believe that the construction debt, cash flows from the lease payments, cash resulting from additional asset divestitures and cash retained from earnings will be sufficient to fund our Power the Future capital expenditures. Investments in Outside Trusts: We have funded our pension obligations, certain other post retirement obligations and future nuclear obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had investments that exceeded $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2003. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. During 2003, our pension investments had returns of 24% and during 2002 we had losses of 13%. Our other trusts had similar returns during these periods. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. Our estimated maximum exposure under these agreements is approximately $77 million as of December 31, 2003. However, we believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. See "Note P Guarantees" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for more information. Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $3,560.2 $144.9 $844.1 $349.0 $2,222.2 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 619.3 52.6 89.8 73.1 403.8 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 302.0 48.4 91.2 73.4 89.0 Purchase Obligations (e) 187.9 115.8 59.6 3.0 9.5 Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 983.2 267.2 377.2 150.0 188.8 Total Contractual Obligations $5,652.6 $628.9 $1,461.9 $648.5 $2,913.3 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.

Obligations for utility operations by our utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. Guarantees: We provide various guarantees supporting certain of our subsidiaries. The guarantees issued by us guarantee payment or performance by our subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions. As a result, our exposure under the guarantees is based upon the net liability of the relevant subsidiary under the specified 52 agreements or transactions. The majority of the guarantees issued by us limit our exposure to a maximum amount stated in the guarantees. See "Note P Guarantees" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for more information. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Commodity Price Risk: In the normal course of business, our utility and non utility power generation subsidiaries utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of electricity. This is done to effectively manage utilization of their available generating capacity and energy during periods when available power resources are expected to exceed the requirements of their obligations. This practice may also include forward contracts for the purchase of power during periods when the anticipated market price of electric energy is below expected incremental power production costs. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium, natural gas and fuel oil. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted, subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag. Regulatory lag risk occurs between the time we submit rate proceedings and we receive final approval or denial. Regulatory risk can increase or decrease due to many factors which may also change during this approval period including commodity price fluctuations, unscheduled operating outages or unscheduled maintenance. In 2002, the PSCW authorized the inclusion of price risk management financial instruments for the management of our electrical utility gas costs. During 2003, a gas hedging program was approved by the PSCW and implemented by Wisconsin Electric. For 2003, Wisconsin Electrics electric fuel cost exceeded fuel recovery by approximately $7.6 million. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for the gas utility operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For additional information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities gas cost recovery mechanisms, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. For information concerning commodity price risk as it applies to gas operations, see "Commodity Price Risk Programs" below. Regulatory Recovery Risk: The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in several of its peaking power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal based plants, and the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas in many instances. Wisconsin Electric bears regulatory risk for the recovery of these fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. As noted above, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity. This clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power, and Wisconsin Electric assumes the risks and benefits of fuel cost variances that are within 3% of the base rate. Wisconsin Electric is subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag once the costs fall outside the 3% variances of the base rate. During the second quarter of 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing new fuel cost adjustment rules to be implemented in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction. The new rules will not be effective for Wisconsin Electric until January 2006, the end of a five year rate freeze associated with the WICOR Merger Order. Until this time, Wisconsin Electric will operate under an approved transaction mechanism s imilar to the old fuel cost adjustment procedure. For 2003, 2002 and 2001, actual fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric exceeded base fuel rates by $7.6 million, $2.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the electric rates included a fuel surcharge. Gas Costs: Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Gas costs have increased significantly because the supply of gas in recent years has not kept pace with the demand for natural 53 gas, which has grown throughout the United States as a result of increased reliance on natural gas based electric generating facilities. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas is added to the nations energy supply mix. Higher gas costs increase our working capital requirements, resulting in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher gas costs combined with poor economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have decreased our risks related to bad debt expenses associated with non paying customers has increased. As a result of gas cost recovery mechanisms, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar pass through on most of the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. Weather: The rates of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to the winter heating season. The gas revenues of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are sensitive to the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2003, 2002 and 2001, as measured by degree days, may be found above in "Results of Operations". Temperature can also impact demand for electricity in regions where we have invested in non utility energy assets or projects. In addition, to the extent weather conditions incurred in various regions are extreme rather than normal or mild our manufacturing segment demand for products can be impacted. Interest Rate Risk: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2003. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2003 of our outstanding portfolio of $609.9 million short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% and $192.9 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.51%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $6.1 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $1.9 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. We entered into treasury rate lock agreements with a major financial institution in order to minimize interest rate risk. Near the end of the first quarter of 2003, we settled several treasury lock agreements entered into earlier in the quarter and during the third quarter of 2002 associated with the issuance of $200 million of long term unsecured senior notes in March 2003. Under a treasury lock agreement, we agree to pay or receive an amount equal to the difference between the net present value of the cash flows for the notional amount of the instrument based on: a) the yield of a U.S. treasury bond at the date when the agreement is established, and b) the yield of a U.S. treasury bond at the date when the agreement is settled, which typically coincides with the debt issuance. As these agreements qualified for cash flow hedging accounting treatment under SFAS 133, the payment made upon settlement of these agreements is deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the same period in which the interest cost is recognized in income. Marketable Securities Return Risk: We fund our pension, other post retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market price of the assets in these trust funds can affect future pension, other post retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Future contributions to these trust funds can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of expense and contribution variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. However, we are currently operating under a PSCW ordered, qualified five year rate restriction period through 2005. For further information about the rate restriction, see "Rates and Regulatory Matters" below. 54 At December 31, 2003, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments. Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $996.4 Nuclear decommissioning trust fund $674.4 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $166.8 We manage our fiduciary oversight of the pension and other post retirement plan trust fund investments through a Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. We conduct asset/liability studies periodically through an outside investment advisor. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments is also the responsibility of the Board appointed Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. An asset/liability study is periodically conducted by an outside investment advisor, subject to additional constraints established by the PSCW. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% in equities. The allocation to equities is expected to be reduced as the date for decommissioning Point Beach Nuclear Plant approaches in order to increase the probability of sufficient liquidity at the time the funds will be needed. Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment results and determines the feasibility of granting a distribution to policyholders. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs, or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs or decreased distributions to Wisconsin Electric. Construction Risk: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of the Port Washington Generating Station consisting of two 545 megawatt natural gas based combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed construction cost of the two Port Washington units at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) ,respectively, subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate and force majeure and excused events provisions. Project management is subject to a number of risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include but are not limited to shortages of, or the inability to obtain, labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their c ontracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions and changes in applicable laws or regulations. If final costs for the construction of the Port Washington Generating Station exceed the fixed costs allowed in the PSCW order this excess cannot be recovered from Wisconsin Electric or its customers unless specifically allowed by the PSCW. In November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 megawatt super critical pulverized coal generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed construction cost of the two Elm Road units at $2.15 billion (year of occurence dollars) subject to a general one year inflation adjustment, force majeure, excused events and event of loss provisions. Project management is subject to a number of risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include but are not limited to shortages of, or the inability to obtain, labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions and changes in applicable laws or regulations. If final costs for the c onstruction of the Elm Road units exceed the PSCW fixed amounts by more than 5%, this excess cannot be recovered from Wisconsin Electric or its customers unless specifically allowed by the PSCW. Independent Power Project (IPP) Market Risk: Prior to the September 2000 Power the Future strategic announcement, we made significant commitments to develop, build and own non utility power plants. Since September 2000, we have made significant progress in exiting many of these projects. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $171.3 million of investments in non utility energy assets excluding We Power. Management believes that the projected cash flows from these investments over the life of these assets will exceed the recorded 55 carrying value. However, the market value of some of these investments is currently believed not to exceed cost. In the fourth quarter of 2001 and continuing into 2003, the IPP market experienced a significant decline driven by several factors, including the softening economy, the financial viability of energy companies with large IPP investments, lower forward electric price curves and a significant tightening of credit to this market. These factors may adversely impact the timing, proceeds and the gain or loss on future sales of non utility energy assets. Credit Rating Risk: We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity and energy services contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or termination payments in the event of a credit ratings change to below investment grade. At December 31, 2003, we estimate that the potential payments under these agreements that could result from credit rating downgrades totaled approximately $99 million. Economic Risk. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment and worldwide economic trends for our manufacturing segment. We use diversification in our portfolio of businesses to reduce our exposure to economic fluctuations. Additionally, our manufacturing segment is exposed to various competition risks in the markets in which we operate. These include foreign sourcing, comparable quality among various competitors, price cutting and aggressive warranties. To help mitigate these risks we have programs in place to implement continuous improvements in our processes, and continued cost reduction efforts. Inflationary Risk: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the impacts on our medical and post retirement benefit plans, we have expectations of low to moderate inflation. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see "Cautionary Factors" below. RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) regulates retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. Wisconsin Jurisdiction WICOR Merger Order: As a condition of its March 2000 approval of the WICOR acquisition, the PSCW ordered a five year rate restriction period in effect freezing electric and natural gas rates for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas effective January 1, 2001. We may seek biennial rate reviews during the five year rate restriction period limited to changes in revenue requirements as a result of: Governmental mandates; Abnormal levels of capital additions required to maintain or improve reliable electric service; and Major gas lateral projects associated with approved natural gas pipeline construction projects. To the extent that natural gas rates and rules need to be modified during the integration of the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, our total gas revenue requirements are to remain revenue neutral under the merger order. In its order, the PSCW found that electric fuel cost adjustment procedures as well as gas cost recovery mechanisms would not be subject to the five year rate restriction period and that it was reasonable to allow us to retain efficiency gains associated with the merger. A full rate review will be required by the PSCW for rates beginning in January 1, 2006. 56 Limited Rate Adjustment Request: On July 2, 2003, we filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric, gas and steam rates for anticipated 2004 revenue deficiencies associated with (1) costs for the new Port Washington Generating Station being constructed as part of our Power the Future strategy, (2) increased costs linked to changes in Wisconsins public benefits legislation, (3) costs for construction of the Ixonia Lateral, and (4) costs related to steam utility operations. The filing identified anticipated revenue deficiencies in 2004 attributable to Wisconsin in the amount of $63.5 million (3.5%) for the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric, $26.2 million (3.9%) for the gas operations of Wisconsin Gas, and $0.6 million (3.9%) for Wisconsin Electrics steam operations. The filing also included an additional anticipated 2005 Wisconsin revenue deficiency in the amount of $0.4 million (2.6%) for Wiscons in Electrics steam operations. In 2004 we expect to file with the PSCW for recovery of additional anticipated 2005 electric revenue deficiencies associated with costs for the Elm Road Generating Station. Hearings on our July 2003 request were completed in December 2003. In February 2004, the PSCW approved an increase in gas rates of $25.9 million. We anticipate an order implementing this increase in March 2004. We anticipate an order from the PSCW on our request related to electric and steam rates in early 2004. Wisconsin Electric Power Company: The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of recent rate changes, primarily in the Wisconsin jurisdiction, authorized by regulatory commissions for Wisconsin Electrics electric, natural gas and steam utilities. Wisconsin Electrics current Wisconsin rates are based on an authorized return on common equity of 12.2%. See "Rates and Regulatory Matters" above for the web site addresses where the related rate orders can be found. Service Wisconsin Electric Incremental Annualized Revenue Increase Percent Change in Rates Effective Date (Millions) (%) Fuel electric, MI $3.3 7.6% January 1, 2004 Fuel electric, WI (a) $6.1 0.3% October 2, 2003 Fuel electric, WI (a) $55.1 3.3% March 14, 2003 Fuel electric, MI $0.9 2.0% January 1, 2003 Retail electric, WI (b) $48.1 3.2% October 22, 2002 Retail electric, MI (c) $3.2 7.8% September 16, 2002 Fuel electric, MI $1.6 3.8% January 1. 2002 Retail gas (d) $3.6 0.9% December 20, 2001 Fuel electric, WI (e) $20.9 1.4% May 3, 2001 Fuel electric, WI (e) $37.8 2.5% February 9, 2001 Fuel electric, MI $1.0 2.4% January 1, 2001 Retail electric, WI $27.5 1.8% January 1, 2001 (a) In October 2003, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $6.1 million of additional fuel costs. In March 2003, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a surcharge for $55.1 million of additional fuel costs on an annualized basis subject to true up. (b) In October 2002, the PSCW issued its order authorizing a surcharge for recovery of $48.1 million of annual estimated incremental costs associated with the formation and operation of ATC. The additional revenues will be offset by additional transmission costs. (c) In September 2002, the MPSC issued an order authorizing an annual electric retail rate increase of $3.2 million for Wisconsin Electric. In addition, the September 2002 order issued by the MPSC authorized us to include the transmission costs from ATC prospectively in its Power Supply Cost Recovery clause. (d) In November 2001, the Milwaukee County Circuit Court overturned the PSCWs August 2000 final order for natural gas rates and the PSCW reinstated a higher April 2000 interim gas rate order, effective December 2001. (e) The February 2001 order was an interim order that was effective until the May 2001 final order was issued by the PSCW. The final May 2001 order superceded the February 2001 interim order. 57 In its final order related to the 2000/2001 biennial period, the PSCW authorized recovery of revenue requirements for, among other things, electric reliability and safety construction expenditures as well as for nitrogen oxide (NOx) remediation expenditures. Revenue requirements for electric reliability and safety construction expenditures were subject to refund at the end of 2001 to the extent that actual expenditures were less than forecasted expenditures included in the final order. During 2002, we accrued a $1.1 million refund liability associated with the electric safety and reliability spending requirements subject to PSCW review and future resolution. In March 2000, the PSCW had previously authorized all Wisconsin utilities to depreciate NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period. Due to the uncertainty regarding the level and timing of these expenditures, the PSCW, in its final order, required Wisconsin Electric to establish escrow accounting for the revenue requirement components associated with NOx expenditures. Wisconsin Electrics actual NOx remediation expenditures resulted in an under spent balance of approximately $2.7 million in the escrow account, a component of deferred regulatory liabilities, at the end of 2003. The NOx escrow balance will be impacted by future NOx expenditures and rate making activities. We have the ability to request biennial rate reviews for certain changes in revenue requirement items. We are currently updating a request for regulatory relief for the year beginning January 1, 2005. See "Limited Rate Adjustment Request" above for more information. Wisconsin Gas Company: Wisconsin Gas rates were set within the framework of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism, which was established by the PSCW in 1994 and expired on October 31, 2001. Under this mechanism, Wisconsin Gas had the ability to raise or lower margin rates within a specified range on a quarterly basis. Currently, Wisconsin Gas rates recover $1.5 million per year less than the maximum amount allowed by the PSCWs rate order. Pursuant to that PSCW directive, Wisconsin Gas rates remain at the same levels as were set prior to the expiration of the Productivity based Alternative Ratemaking Mechanism. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: In September 2001, Wisconsin Electric requested that the PSCW approve $58.8 million of annual rate relief to recover the estimated incremental costs associated with the formation and operation of ATC, which was designed to enhance transmission access and increase electric system reliability and market efficiency in the state of Wisconsin. Wisconsin Electric was also seeking to recover associated incremental transmission costs of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc., the multi state organization that monitors and controls electric transmission throughout the Midwest. These increased costs are primarily due to the implementation of capital improvement projects for the period 2001 2005 and associated operation costs that are expected to increase transmission capacity and reliability. In October 2002, the PSCW issued its order authorizing a surcharge for recovery of $48 million of annual costs reflecting lower projected transmission costs through 2005 than we estimated. Recognizing the uncertainty of these transmission related costs, the PSCW order authorized a four year escrow accounting treatment such that rate recovery will ultimately be trued up to actual costs plus a return on the unrecovered costs. The October 2002 order increased annual revenues and operating costs by approximately $48 million, with an insignificant impact to net earnings. We estimate that we are recovering approximately 96% of our incremental transmission related costs from our customers. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. In December 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application to the PSCW seeking a $51.4 million increase in rates on an expedited basis to recover increased costs of fuel and purchased power in 2001. Wisconsin Electric revised its projected power supply cost shortfall in January 2001 to reflect updated natural gas cost projections for 2001. This update resulted in a request for an additional $11.1 million in 2001, bringing the total requested increase to $62.5 million. In February 2001, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a $37.8 million increase in rates for 2001 power supply costs. The PSCW issued a final order in May 2001, effective immediately, authorizing a total increase in rates of $58.7 mill ion (or an additional $20.9 million over the interim order). Under the final order, Wisconsin Electric would have to refund to customers any over recoveries of fuel costs as a result of the surcharges authorized in 2001. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we did not over recover fuel costs. During the second quarter of 2002, the PSCW issued an order authorizing new fuel cost adjustment rules to be implemented in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction. The order redefined fuel for fuel cost recovery. The new rules will not be effective for Wisconsin Electric until January 2006, the end of a five year rate freeze associated with the WICOR Merger Order. Until such time, Wisconsin Electric will operate under an approved transaction mechanism similar to the old fuel cost adjustment procedure. 58 In addition, as previously reported, on June 4, 2001, two consumer advocacy groups petitioned the Dane County Circuit Court for review of decisions related to authorization by the PSCW for Wisconsin Electric to add a surcharge to its electric rates to recover its expected 2001 power supply costs. The petitioners alleged that the PSCW made various material errors of law and procedure as a result of which the Court should set aside both interim and final orders and remand the case to the PSCW. The case was settled and, in May 2002, the Dane County Circuit Court issued a final order dismissing the petition. In February 2003, Wisconsin Electric completed a power supply cost analysis which included updated natural gas cost projections for 2003. Based on this analysis, in February 2003 we determined that projected costs had deviated outside of a range prescribed by the PSCW when compared to fuel and purchased power costs authorized in current rates. As a result, we filed a request with the PSCW to increase Wisconsin retail electric rates by $55.1 million annually to recover the forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. Wisconsin Electric received an interim order from the PSCW authorizing an increase of $55.1 million in electric rates in March 2003. In October 2003, the PSCW approved the fuel surcharge adjustment request authorizing an increase of $61.2 million for 2003, $6.1 million more than the interim order on an annualized basis. The final order reflects seven months of actual costs incurred plus changes in natural gas prices. The final order impo ses an obligation on Wisconsin Electric to refund any fuel surcharge amounts that result in excess revenues as defined. We do not anticipate a refund will occur. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: As a result of our acquisition of WICOR, the PSCW required similar gas cost recovery mechanisms (GCRM) for the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and for Wisconsin Gas. Prior to the acquisition, Wisconsin Electric had operated under a modified dollar for dollar GCRM, which included after the fact prudence reviews by the PSCW, while the Wisconsin Gas GCRM included an incentive mechanism that provides an opportunity for Wisconsin Gas to increase or decrease earnings within certain limited ranges as a result of gas acquisition activities and transportation costs. For both companies, the majority of gas costs are passed through to customers under their existing gas cost recovery mechanisms. In February 2001, the PSCW issued an order to Wisconsin Electric and to Wisconsin Gas authorizing a similar GCRM for each company. These new GCRMs, which were effective in April 2001, are similar to the existing GCRM at Wisconsin Gas. Under the new GCRMs, gas costs are passed directly to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause. However, both companies have the opportunity to increase or decrease earnings by up to approximately 2.5% of their total annual gas costs based upon how closely actual gas commodity and capacity costs compare to benchmarks established by the PSCW. Commodity Price Risk Programs: The gas operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have commodity risk management programs that have been approved by the PSCW. These programs hedge the cost of natural gas. As gas costs are recovered from customers, changes in the value of the financial instruments do not impact net income. These programs allow our gas utilities to utilize option contracts to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas purchases and gas in storage. Under these programs, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric have the ability to hedge up to 50% of their planned flowing gas and storage inventory volumes. The cost of applicable call and put option contracts, as well as gains or losses realized under the contracts, do not affect net income as they are fully recovered under the purchase gas adjustment clauses of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric gas cost recovery mechanisms. In addition, under the Gas Cost Incentive Me chanism, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric use derivative financial instruments to manage the cost of gas. The cost of these financial instruments, as well as any gains or losses on the contracts, are subject to sharing under the incentive mechanisms. For information concerning commodity price risk as it applies to electric operations see "Commodity Price Risk" above. Bad Debt Expense: Under escrow accounting Wisconsin Gas expensed amounts included in rates for bad debt expense. If actual bad debt costs exceeded amounts allowed in rates, these amounts were deferred as a regulatory asset. In October 2002, the PSCW issued an order which eliminated escrow accounting for bad debts effective October 1, 2002. The escrow amount accumulated at September 30, 2002 of approximately $6.9 million is expected to be collected in future rates, but future bad debt expense at Wisconsin Gas will no longer be subject to this separate true up mechanism. 59 In 2003, due to a combination of unusually high natural gas prices, the soft economy within our utility service territories, and limited governmental assistance available to low income customers, we have seen a significant increase in uncollectible accounts receivable. Because of this, we sent a letter to the PSCW in July 2003 requesting authority to defer for future rate recovery all residential bad debt write offs during 2003 in excess of amounts included in current annual utility rates. The PSCW approved our request for deferral of 2003 uncollectible accounts receivable effective October 2003. We have deferred approximately $15.6 million in uncollectible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2003. Our annual residential bad debt expense in base rates is approximately $22.9 million. Ixonia Lateral: On January 15, 2003, Wisconsin Gas received from the WDNR a Chapter 30 permit to construct the Ixonia Lateral after lengthy negotiations with the WDNR and interested parties. In February 2003, Wisconsin Gas filed updated cost estimates reflecting additional costs of approximately $14.0 million required by the WDNR permit conditions. In March 2003, the PSCW approved the updated construction cost estimate of $97.5 million. Wisconsin Gas started construction on the 35 mile Ixonia Lateral in April 2003. Wisconsin Gas completed construction and placed the Ixonia Lateral in service during December 2003. The Ixonia Lateral provides substantial gas cost savings as well as critical additional pipeline capacity. Power the Future Port Washington: The PSCW issued a written order on December 20, 2002 (the Port Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of the Port Washington Generating Station consisting of two 545 megawatt natural gas based combined cycle generating units (Port Units 1 and 2) on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The Port Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral and ATC to construct required transmission system upgrades to serve the Port Washington Generating Station. As part of the proceedings, the PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain Port Units 1 and 2. Key financial terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt for lease computation purposes; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% on equity for lease calculation purposes; Fixed construction cost of the two Port units at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority only over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms. After receiving approval for the Port Washington project, We Power entered into binding contracts with third parties to secure necessary engineering, design and construction services and major equipment components for Port Unit 1. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric commenced demolition of two of its existing coal based generating units on the Port Washington plant site to make room for the new facility. We Power began construction of the new facility in July 2003 and expects to complete construction by the end of the second quarter of 2005. We Power began collecting certain costs from Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of 2003 as provided for in lease generation contracts that were signed in May 2003. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to defer costs for recovery in future rates. The PSCW approved the request in an open meeting in April 2003. (See "Limited Rate Adjustment Request" above for further information.) Before beginning construction of Port Unit 2, the Port Order requires that an updated demand and energy forecast be filed with the PSCW to document market demand for additional generating capacity. In October 2003, we received approval from the FERC to transfer by long term lease certain associated FERC jurisdictional assets from We Power to Wisconsin Electric. In March 2003, an individual who participated in the Port Washington CPCN proceedings before the PSCW filed a petition for review with the Dane County Circuit Court requesting the Court to reverse and remand in its entirety the PSCWs December 2002 Port Order granting the CPCN. In January 2004, the Dane County Circuit Court issued a decision vacating the Port Order and remanding the matter to the PSCW to develop additional environmental analysis to justify its decision to perform only an Environmental Assessment, rather than a more comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement. The PSCW has begun a process to revise the Environmental Assessment consistent with the Courts decisions. The PSCW has not made a decision on whether to appeal the Dane County Circuit Court decision. 60 Associated with construction of the Port Washington Generating Station, Wisconsin Gas received a Certificate of Authority from the PSCW in January 2003 authorizing construction of a 16.8 mile gas lateral that will connect the plant to the ANR Pipeline. It will also improve reliability for the natural gas distribution system in the area. We received a Chapter 30 wetland permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) in July 2003 approving construction of this lateral. The WDNR permitted construction of substantially the entire lateral consistent with the planned route previously approved by the PSCW, with certain exceptions. We have modified the planned route pursuant to the WDNRs request and received the necessary approvals for the modified route. Including the requested changes, the PSCW, approved an updated cost estimate for the project of $41.5 million in November 2003. Construction of the lateral is scheduled to begin in spring 2004 and to be comp leted by late 2004. In July and August 2003, two landowners filed separate Petitions for Review in Ozaukee County Circuit Court challenging the Chapter 30 permit issued in July 2003 by the WDNR to Wisconsin Gas for the Port Washington Lateral natural gas pipeline. Further, in September 2003, one of the same landowners filed an additional Petition for Review in Ozaukee County Circuit Court challenging the WDNRs denial of a request for a contested case hearing on the issuance of the Chapter 30 permit. We have reached a settlement with the landowners and the Petitions for Review have been dismissed. Power the Future Elm Road: In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Elm Road Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 megawatt coal based units (the Elm Road units) to be located on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The Elm Road Order concluded: Additional electric generation was required for Southeast Wisconsin; A diversity of fuel sources best serves the state; Two coal fired super critical pulverized coal units should be constructed with the first plant going on line in 2009 and the second going on line in 2010; The cost to construct the two coal units will be $2.15 billion (subject to adjustment for one year of escalation costs), which is expected to result in an approved project cost of $2.19 billion; The return on equity on the lease agreement with Wisconsin Electric will be set at 12.7% with a capital structure that includes 55% equity; If the actual project cost is less than the approved project cost, the actual cost will be used in the lease. If the actual project cost exceeds the approved project cost, excess costs up to 5% of the approved project cost may be recoverable, subject to a prudence requirement; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; The CPCN will be granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary air quality and water permits; Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority only over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Elm Road Order, which do not include the key financial terms; and The third proposed integrated gasification combined cycle unit was not approved at this time as the technology is not currently considered cost effective. We expect that we will have co owners for approximately 17% of the project. In December 2003, we submitted lease generation contracts for the Elm Road units to the PSCW for approval. We continue to work with the PSCW, the WDNR and other agencies to obtain all required permits and project approvals. In March 2003, the City of Oak Creek reached a tentative environmental and economic agreement with us covering our expansion plans for new generation at the Oak Creek site. We have also agreed to follow the City of Oak Creeks conditional use permit for construction on the Oak Creek site. Four appeals challenging the PSCWs Elm Road Order have been filed, which appeals have been consolidated in Dane County Circuit Court. We have filed a Notice of Appearance and Statement of Position in three of these proceedings requesting that the PSCWs decision be upheld and the petitions be dismissed. Also, two cases were filed in January 2004 in Dane County Circuit Court against the WDNR contending that the WDNR did not comply with state laws when it participated with the PSCW in preparing the Environmental Impact Statement for the Elm Road units. We have filed a Notice of Appearance and Statement of Position in these two proceedings requesting that the WDNRs decision be upheld and the petitions be dismissed. 61 In September 2003, several parties filed a request with the WDNR for a contested case hearing in connection with our application to the WDNR for a water discharge permit for the Elm Road units. That request was granted. In January 2004, the WDNR issued the air pollution control construction permit to Wisconsin Electric for the Elm Road units. In February 2004, parties submitted to the WDNR and to the Dane County Circuit Court requests for a contested case hearing and for judicial review, respectively, on the Elm Road units air pollution control construction permit. No proceedings on these permit hearings have been scheduled. We continue to work with the PSCW and the WDNR, and other agencies, to obtain all required permits and project approvals. Michigan Jurisdiction Wisconsin Electric Power Company: In mid November 2000, Wisconsin Electric submitted an application with the MPSC requesting an electric retail rate increase of $3.7 million or 9.4% on an annualized basis. Hearings on this rate relief request were completed in June of 2001. In December of 2001, the MPSC issued an order reopening the case on a limited basis to incorporate the rate effects of the transfer of Wisconsin Electric transmission assets to ATC. Hearings were completed in April 2002. In September 2002, the MPSC issued its order authorizing an annual electric retail rate increase of $3.2 million effective immediately. On February 20, 2003, International Paper Corporation filed a claim of appeal from the Michigan Public Service Commissions final order in Case No. U 12725, which awarded us a $3.2 million rate increase and changed the procedures by which we recover the cost of obtaining transmission services. We believe the MPSC will prevai l in defense of its order. Used Nuclear Fuel Rates: In March 2003, a group of consumer advocacy groups led by the Michigan Environmental Council (collectively, MEC) filed a Formal Complaint and Request to Open a Formal Proceeding (the Complaint) with the MPSC naming Wisconsin Electric and four other utilities operating in Michigan as defendants. MEC claims that Wisconsin Electric improperly collects revenues for used nuclear fuel storage and disposal. The amounts of these revenues claimed by MEC to be collected from Michigan customers is between $2.3 million and $11.4 million. MEC requested that the MPSC open a contested case and review the rate making mechanisms for these used nuclear fuel revenues, as well as prospective remedies including ratepayer reductions, long term mechanisms to ensure that used nuclear fuel revenues do not become stranded and performance or surety bonds to protect Michigan ratepayers. In April 2003, the MPSC certified the Complaint. Wisconsin Electri c filed a notice of intent to file claim with the Michigan Court of Claims and a motion to dismiss the complaint with the MPSC in May 2003. MEC filed its answer to Wisconsin Electrics motion to dismiss in July 2003. Wisconsin Electrics management believes that the revenues are properly collected as the collection of these revenues is authorized by the MPSC. The resolution of this matter is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations or the financial condition or results of operations of Wisconsin Electric. Edison Sault Electric Company: In September 1995, the MPSC approved Edison Saults application to implement price cap regulation for its electric customers in the state of Michigan, capping base rates at existing levels, rolling its existing fuel cost adjustment procedure or Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) factor into base rates and suspending its existing PSCR clause. Edison Sault was required to give thirty days notice for rate decreases. The order authorizing Edison Saults price cap represented a temporary experimental regulatory mechanism and allows Edison Sault to file an application seeking an increase in rates under extraordinary circumstances. In October 2000, Edison Sault filed a report with the MPSC addressing its experience under the price cap mechanism. In September 2001, Edison Sault submitted an application to reinstate its PSCR clause in January 2002 and to incorporate therein 2002 incremental ATC charges and certain miscellaneous costs in the amou nt of $0.6 million. In October 2001, Edison Sault filed an application with the MPSC to establish its PSCR factor for the year 2002. In April 2002, the MPSC issued orders authorizing Edison Sault to reimplement its PSCR clause, beginning May 1, 2002. PSCR revenues and costs are subject to true up hearings. In March 2003, the MPSC approved a PSCR factor of 0.00032 per kwh for calendar year 2003. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Consistent with the requests in Wisconsin noted above, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the MPSC in September 2001 for rate recovery of estimated 2002 transmission costs over 2001 levels in the amount of $0.3 million through the Michigan Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism. In September 2002, the MPSC issued an order that authorized Wisconsin Electric to recover transmission costs in its Power Supply Cost Recovery clause prospectively. In April 2003, we received MPSC approval to defer costs associated with the start up, formation of, and obtaining transmission service from ATC. As of December 31, 2003, 62 we have deferred $1.2 million of start up and network charges for the period January 2001 through September 2002 plus carrying costs. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern digital equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system as part of our Power the Future strategy. We are taking some immediate steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. In the long term, we are initiating a new distribution system design that is expected to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy, using new technology, advanced communications and a two way electricity flow. Implementation of our Power the Future strategy is subject to a number of state and federal regulatory approvals. For additional information, see "Cor porate Developments" above. Wisconsin Electric had adequate capacity to meet all of its firm electric load obligations during 2003. All of Wisconsin Electrics generating plants performed well during the hottest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required, nor was there the need to interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates. In mid May a flood at a hydroelectric dam owned by another utility forced a complete shutdown of the 618 megawatt Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan, which resulted in the curtailment of non firm service to some customers, as well as brief interruptions to firm service. Deliveries were also curtailed on several occasions to certain special contract customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan because of transmission constraints in the area including an incident in December 2003. During the December incident, flow was interrupted on the three main electric transmission lines owned by ATC connecting Wisconsin to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This incident also resulted in short outages to some firm customers. Wisconsin Electric expects to have adequate capacity to meet all of its firm load obligations during 2004. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require Wisconsin Electric to call upon load management procedures during 2004 as it has in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face potentially significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), small particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel, and (5) the eventual decommissioning of nuclear power plants. We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including (1) substituting new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of our Power the Future strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) participating in regional initiatives to reduce the emissions of NOx from our fossil fuel based generating facilities, (4) entering into agreements with the WDNR and EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% and mercury by 50% within 10 years from Wisconsin Electrics coal based power plants in Wisconsin and Michigan, (5) recycling of ash from coal based generating units, and (6) the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA agreement is estimated to be approximately $600 million over 10 years. For further information concerning the consent decree, see "Note S Commitments and C ontingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. For further information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see "Nuclear Operations" below and "Note F Nuclear Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, respectively. 63 National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In July 1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and fine particulate matter. Legal challenges to the new standards are complete and the EPA and the states are currently developing rules to implement them. Although specific emission control requirements are not yet defined, Wisconsin Electric believes that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from coal based generating facilities. Wisconsin Electric expects that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8 hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages from 2007 through 2010, beginning with the 1 hour ozone reductions described below. Reductions associated with the new fine particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and extending to the year 2017. Beyond the cost estimates identified below, Wiscons in Electric is currently unable to estimate the impact of the revised air quality standards on its future liquidity, financial condition or results of operation. Ozone Non Attainment Standards: The 1 hour ozone nonattainment rules currently being implemented by the state of Wisconsin and ozone transport rules implemented by the state of Michigan limit NOx emissions in phases over the next five years. Wisconsin Electric currently expects to incur total annual operation and maintenance costs of $1 2 million during the period 2004 through 2005 to comply with the Michigan and Wisconsin rules. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NOx emission reductions requirements will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPAs 8 hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards discussed above. In January 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics comprehensive plan to meet the Wisconsin regulations, permitting recovery in rates of NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period. Mercury Emission Control Rulemaking: As required by the 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the EPA issued a regulatory determination in December 2000 that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. The EPA issued draft rules in December 2003 and will issue final rules by December 2004. In June 2001, the WDNR independently developed draft mercury emission control rules that would affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. In May 2003, the WDNR released a final draft of the proposed rules, which include mercury emission reductions of 40% by 2010 and 80% by 2015. The rules provide for a multi emission alternative approach for compliance, but it is not clear if this would apply to the second phase of reductions. In June 2003, the Natural Resources Board approved the rules and sent them to the Wisconsin Legislature. The Wisconsin Legislature rejected the rules during the third quarter of 2003. We are currently unable to predict the ultimate rules, if any, that will be developed and adopted by the EPA or the WDNR, nor are we able to predict the impacts, if any, that the EPAs and WDNRs mercury emission control rulemakings might have on the operations of our existing or anticipated coal based generating facilities. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see "Note S Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its combustion byproducts. For further information, see "Note S Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Manufacturing Segment: WICOR Industries has provided reserves which it believes are sufficient to cover its estimated costs related to known contamination associated with its manufacturing facilities. EPA Information Requests: Wisconsin Electric and Wisvest Connecticut LLC., formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Wisvest, each received requests for information from the EPA regional offices pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information related to Wisconsin Electric, see "Note S Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Wisvest Connecticut received requests for information from the EPA regional office pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act in May 2000 and February 2001. All membership interests in Wisvest Connecticut were sold in December 2002 to PSEG Fossil, LLC, which is now the new owner and operator of the electric generating facilities that were the subject of the EPA information requests. Additionally, any liabilities relating to the information 64 requests which were covered under our guaranty to United Illuminating, the prior owner of the facilities, have been covered by a guaranty by PSEG Power, LLC. LEGAL MATTERS Giddings & Lewis Inc./City of West Allis Lawsuit: In July 1999, a jury issued a verdict against Wisconsin Electric awarding the plaintiffs $4.5 million in compensatory damages and $100 million in punitive damages in an action alleging that Wisconsin Electric had deposited contaminated wastes at two sites in West Allis, Wisconsin owned by the plaintiffs. In September 2001, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned the $100 million punitive damage award and remanded the punitive damage claim to the lower court for retrial. In January 2002, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs petition for review. Plaintiffs claims were settled during 2002 for a total cost of $17.3 million. During 2003, we reached settlements with various insurance carriers for approximately $11.2 million. We are continuing to pursue litigation against the remaining insurance carriers and other third parties. For further information, see "Note S Commit ments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Presque Isle Flood: During the second quarter of 2003 our Presque Isle Power Plant was temporarily shut down due to the failure of a hydroelectric reservoir dike which flooded Marquette, Michigan. We estimate that our fuel and purchased power costs increased by approximately $8 million due to the need for replacement power during the plant outage. These increased costs were included as part of the fuel surcharge request discussed above. In addition, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in damage to equipment and property. We are pursuing recovery from insurance carriers and other parties for the above costs. We are continuing to analyze and refine the costs associated with this matter. Other: Wisvest has a 49.5% ownership interest in Androscoggin LLC (Androscoggin), which owns a co generation power plant in Maine. Androscoggin has an energy services agreement with a company that receives steam from the co generation plant. The steam customer filed a lawsuit against Androscoggin alleging breach of contract under the energy services agreement. The lawsuit is tentatively scheduled to go to a jury trial in 2004. For further information, see "Note D Assets Sales and Divestitures" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric owns two 518 megawatt electric generating units at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin which are operated by Nuclear Management Company, LLC (NMC), a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, Point Beach provided 25% of Wisconsin Electrics net electric energy supply. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) operating licenses for Point Beach expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2. In July 2000, our senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both units at Point Beach. Subject to approval by the PSCW, the project could add approximately 90 megawatts of electrical output to Point Beach. In February 2003, Point Beach completed an equipment upgrade, which resulted in a capacity increase of 7 megawatts per generating unit. We are currently evaluating the timing for implementation of the power uprate project. In 2003, NMC formed an operating license renewal team which completed a technical and economic evaluation of license renewal. Based upon the results of this evaluation and following approval by executive management and our Board of Directors in December 2003, NMC filed an application with the NRC in February 2004 to renew the operating licenses for both of Point Beachs nuclear reactors for an additional 20 years. In February 2003, NRC issued an order establishing interim inspection requirements for reactor vessel heads at pressurized water reactors. The order formally establishes requirements for licensees to implement the provisions of NRC Bulletin 2002 02, "Reactor Pressure Vessel Head and Vessel Head Penetration Nozzle Inspection Programs," issued in August 2002. We plan to replace both reactor vessel heads during the 2005 refueling outages as an 65 alternative to incurring the additional time and costs of these examinations and filed such an application with the PSCW in June 2003. In October 2003, the PSCW approved reactor vessel head replacement for Units 1 and 2 at Point Beach. Total capital expenditure to replace the two reactor vessel heads is estimated at approximately $54 million. During 2002 and 2003 the NRC issued Final Significance Determination letters for two red (high safety significance) inspection findings regarding problems identified by Point Beach with the performance of the auxiliary feedwater system recirculation lines. During 2003, the NRC conducted a three phase supplemental inspection of Point Beach in accordance with NRC Inspection Procedure 95003 to review corrective actions for the findings as well as the effectiveness of the corrective action, emergency preparedness and engineering programs. The inspection results were presented at a public meeting in December 2003, and documented in a February 2004 NRC letter to NMC. The NRC determined that the plant is being operated in a manner that ensures public safety but also identified several performance issues in the areas of problem identification and resolution, emergency preparedness, electrical design basis calculation control and engineering operations communication. NMC responded to the supplemental inspection in February 2004 with specific commitments to address the NRC concerns, including revision of the Point Beach Excellence Plan. NRC will review the adequacy of the revised Excellence Plan and its implementation and will continue to provide increased oversight at Point Beach. As a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, NRC and the industry have been strengthening security at nuclear power plants. Security at Point Beach remains at a high level, with limited access to the site continuing. Point Beach has responded to NRCs February 2002 Order for interim safeguards and security compensatory measures. Point Beach has also responded to NRC orders regarding security of independent spent fuel storage installations, design basis threat, and security officer training and work hours. We are currently unable to estimate the further impact, if any, that may result. Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: Wisconsin Electric is authorized to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their current operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the United States Department of Energy takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987 (the Waste Act). Effective January 31, 1998, the Department of Energy failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $193.2 million over the life of the plant. The Department of Energy has indicated that it does not expect a permanent used fuel repository to be available any earlier than 2010. It is not possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the Department of Energy will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel. On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the Department of Energys failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the Department of Energy in the Court of Federal Claims. The matter is pending. As of December 2003, Wisconsin Electric has incurred damages in excess of $70 million, which it seeks to recover from the United States Department of Energy. Damages continue to accrue, and, accordingly, Wisconsin Electric expects to seek recovery of its damages in this lawsuit. In January 2002, as required by the Waste Act, the Secretary of Energy notified the Governor of Nevada and the Nevada Legislature that he intended to recommend to the President that the Yucca Mountain site is scientifically sound and suitable for development as the nations long term geological repository for used nuclear fuel. In February 2002, the Secretary provided the formal recommendation to the President. In a February 2002 letter to Congress, the President expressed his support for the development of the Yucca Mountain site. The letter also affirmed the need for a permanent repository by supporting the need for nuclear power and its cost competitiveness, as well as acknowledging that successful completion of the repository program will redeem the clear Federal legal obligation set forth in the Waste Act. In April 2002, the Nevada Governor announced the states official disapproval of the Presidents recommendation. In May 2002, the U.S. House of Representatives endorsed the Pres idents 66 recommendation to develop the Yucca Mountain site as the nations long term geological repository for used nuclear fuel overriding the state of Nevadas objections. In July 2002, the U.S. Senate approved Yucca Mountain as such a repository. The President signed the resolution in July 2002 which cleared the way for the United States Department of Energy to begin preparation of the application to the NRC for a license to design and build the repository. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry Across the United States, electric industry restructuring progress has generally stalled subsequent to the California price and supply problems in early 2001. The wide spread outage in the eastern United States in August of 2003 further slowed the pace of electric industry restructuring. FERC continues to strongly support large Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. The timeline for restructuring and retail access continues to be stretched out, and it is uncertain when retail access will happen in Wisconsin. Late in 2003 a federal energy bill containing changes that would impact the electric utility industry passed the U. S. House of Representatives, however it was not passed by the Senate. Major issues in industry restructuring like deregulating existing generation, unbundling transmission and generation from distribution costs, implementing RTOs, and market power mitigation received little attention in 2003. We continue to focus on infr astructure issues through our Power the Future growth strategy. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, Wisconsin is proceeding with restructuring of the electric utility industry at a much slower pace than many other states in the United States. Instead, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin such as: Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Continued development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; and Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: Electric utility revenues are regulated by the MPSC. In June 2000, the Governor of Michigan signed the "Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act" into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. The new law provides that as of January 1, 2002 all Michigan retail customers of investor owned utilities have the ability to choose their electric power producer. The Michigan Retail Access law was characterized by the Michigan Governor as "Choice for those who want it and protection for those who need it." As of January 1, 2002, Michigan retail customers of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in the companies service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of one general inquiry, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan, reflecting the small market area, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. 67 Restructuring in Illinois: In 1999, the state of Illinois passed legislation that introduced retail electric choice for large customers and introduced choice for all retail customers in May 2002. This legislation is not expected to have a material impact on Wisconsin Electrics business. Wisconsin Electric has one wholesale customer in Illinois, the City of Geneva, whose contract is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. However, Wisvests wholly owned subsidiary, Calumet Energy Team, LLC, does compete in the Illinois electric generation market with power produced from its 308 megawatt gas based peaking plant that entered commercial operation in 2002. We believe that the Illinois choice legislation will not materially affect Calumet Energys operating results. Electric Transmission American Transmission Company: Effective January 1, 2001, we transferred all of the electric utility transmission assets of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault to American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) in exchange for ownership interests in this new company. Joining ATC is consistent with the FERCs Order No. 2000, designed to foster competition, efficiency and reliability in the electric industry. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission owning member of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO). As of February 1, 2002, operational control of ATCs transmission system was transferred to the Midwest ISO, and Wisconsin Electric became a non transmission owning member and customer of the Midwest ISO. Midwest ISO: In connection with its role as a FERC approved RTO, the Midwest ISO is in the process of developing a bid based energy market which is currently proposed to be implemented on December 1, 2004. In connection with the development of this energy market, the Midwest ISO is developing a market based platform for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the locational marginal pricing (LMP) system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid atlantic states. It is expected that the LMP system will include the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through the use of Financial Transmission Rights (FTR) which will be initially allocated by the Midwest ISO and, it is anticipated, will be available through an auction based system run by the Midwest ISO. It is unknown at this time how and in what quantity FTRs will be initially allocated by the Midwest ISO and what, if any, the financial impact of the LMP congestion pricing system might have on Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. The Midwest ISO is currently deferring the costs to start up its energy market (new software systems and personnel), but once the market is operational, these costs will be charged to customers. In the Midwest ISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load serving entities (LSEs) located in the service territories of each Midwest ISO transmission owner in proportion to the load served by the LSE versus the total load of the service territory. This "license plate" rate design is scheduled to be replaced after a six year phase in of rates in Midwest ISO. It is unknown at this point what rate design will replace the license plate rate design or the impact that any new rate design will have on Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. Lost Revenue Charges: The FERC permits transmission owning utilities that have not joined an RTO to propose a charge to recover revenues that would be lost as a result of RTO membership. These lost revenues result from FERCs requirement that, within an RTO and for transmission between the systems operated by the Midwest ISO and PJM Interconnection, LLC, entities that currently pay a transmission charge to move energy through or out of a neighboring transmission system will no longer pay this charge to the neighboring transmission system owner or operator upon the neighboring transmission system owner or operator joining an RTO. In December 2003, Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault, along with other entities, reached an agreement with the Midwest ISO and a consortium of companies referred to as the Grid America Companies on a lost revenue payment resulting from the Grid America Companies decision to place their transmission facilities under the operational control of the Midwest ISO. Discussions as to appropriate lost revenue charges are currently ongoing with regard to several entities decisions, including that of Commonwealth Edison Company, a transmission provider to Wisconsin Electric, to place their transmission facilities under the control of PJM. 68 Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW has instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). This standard requires an enterprise that is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity. The Interpretation was applied to any existing interests in variable interest entities beginning in the third quarter of 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred the adoption of FIN 46 for entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. See "Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In December 2003, the FASB revised the effective date for all other types of entities to financial statements for periods after March 15, 2004. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the application of these new rules, we anticipate we may have to consolidate some immateral equity method investments upon adoption of the final phase of Interpretation 46. The FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106 1, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003", (FSP 106 1) that allows sponsors to elect to defer recognition of the effects of the Act. In accordance with FSP 106 1, we elected to defer recognition of the effects of the Act. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance, when issued, could require us to change previously reported information. See "Note O Benefits" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may result in future utility prices which are based upon factors other than the traditional original cost of investment. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2003, we had $612.3 million in regulatory assets and $887.7 million in regulatory liabilities. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have 69 determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. See "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Valuation of Long Lived Assets and Investments: We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets and our investments, excluding goodwill, when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The review of assets for impairment requires significant assumptions regarding operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows. An estimate of future cash flows contains many significant assumptions including, but not limited to future price curves, future operating costs and the expected growth of the economy. A variation in an assumption could result in a different conclusion regarding the realizability of the asset. In 2003 and 2002 we recorded impairment charges primarily related to long lived assets and investments associated with our non utility energy assets. See "Note D Asset Sales and Divestitures" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In determining the amount of impairment charges related to our non utility energy assets, we considered the estimated length of time we expected to hold the assets and we estimated the current market value which would be realized upon sale of the assets based upon similar asset sales. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefits: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in "Note O Benefits" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 72% of our pension plan assets were invested in equity securities. Remaining plan assets were invested primarily in corporate and government bonds. During 2002, the funded status of our plans fell significantly due to the decline in the value of plan investments and due to the increase in the benefit obligation resulting from a lower discount rate. Our pension plans went from a $27 million overfunded status as of December 31, 2001 to a $218 million underfunded status as of December 31, 2002. As a result, we recorded a minimum pension liability of $113 million in December 2002. The regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 87 and 88 for rate making purposes. As such, during 2002 we recorded a corresponding $288 million regulatory asset under SFAS 71 (see "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) representing future pension costs expected to be recoverable in future rates. As of December 31, 2003 approximately 76% of our pension plan assets were invested in equity securities. Remaining plan assets were invested primarily in corporate and government bonds. During 2003, the funded status of our plans recovered from the 2002 levels, but still remain $182 million underfunded. As a result, we recorded a minimum pension liability of $34 million in December 2003. We recorded a corresponding $189 million regulatory asset under SFAS 71 during 2003 (see "Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) representing future pension costs expected to be recoverable in future rates. The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. 70 Pension Plan Actuarial Assumption (a) Impact on Reported Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $3.7 0.5% decrease in rate of return on plan assets $5.2 (a) The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction In addition to pension plans, we maintain other post retirement benefit plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in "Note O Benefits" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for these plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future post retirement benefit costs. Other post retirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the post retirement benefit obligation and post retirement costs. Our other post retirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes. The following chart reflects other post retirement benefit plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. Other Post retirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumption (a) Impact on Reported Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.4 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate ($1.6) 0.5% decrease in rate of return on plan assets $0.6 (a) The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), effective January 1, 2002, we are required to perform annual assessments of our goodwill for impairment by applying fair value based tests. As of December 31, 2003, we had $835.9 million of goodwill on our balance sheet primarily attributable to our April 2000 acquisition of the gas utility and manufacturing businesses of Wicor, Inc. To perform our annual test of goodwill, we are required to make various assumptions including assumptions about the future profitability of our utility and manufacturing operations as compared to published projections for other similar businesses. A significant change in these markets or in our projections could result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss related to a decrease in the goodwill asset. 71 We reviewed our goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of 2003 as part of our annual test as required by SFAS 142. We determined that there were no impairments to the recorded goodwill balance for any of our reporting units. In addition, SFAS 142 required the elimination of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset amortization on January 1, 2002 which resulted in an increase in net income of $21.3 million for 2002. At this time, we are unable to predict whether any adjustments to goodwill and other intangible assets will occur in the future. For further information, see "Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2003 of $3.3 billion included accrued utility revenues of $212 million at December 31, 2003 . Asset Retirement Obligations: Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which requires entities to recognize the estimated fair value of legal liabilities for asset retirements in the period in which they are incurred. SFAS 143 applies primarily to decommissioning costs for our utility energy segments Point Beach Nuclear Plant. Using a discounted future cash flow methodology, we estimated that our nuclear asset retirement obligation was approximately $673 million at January 1, 2003. Calculation of this asset retirement obligation is based upon projected decommissioning costs calculated by an independent decommissioning consulting firm as well as several significant assumptions including the timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates, the discount rate applied to future cash flows and an 85% probability of plant relicensing. Assu ming the following changes in key assumptions and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimate that our nuclear asset retirement obligation at January 1, 2003 would have changed by the following amounts: Change in Assumption Change in Liability (Millions of Dollars) 1% increase in inflation rate $226 1% decrease in inflation rate ($167) 0% probability of license extension $138 100% probability of license extension ($24) At January 1, 2004, we were unable to identify a viable market for or third party who would be willing to assume this liability. Accordingly, we used a market risk premium of zero when measuring our nuclear asset retirement obligation. We estimate that for each 1% increment that would be included as a market risk premium, our nuclear asset retirement obligation would increase by approximately $7.1 million. For additional information concerning adoption of SFAS 143 and our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation, see "Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements" and "Note F Nuclear Operations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance: At December 31, 2003, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $22 million related to state net operating loss carryforwards (state NOLs), of which $11 million relates to state NOLs of the parent company that begin to expire in 2006. The remainder of the allowance relates to state NOLs of various other non utility subsidiaries. The state NOLs have been generated over a period of many years due to taxable losses in the separate state income tax returns. The losses at the Parent were primarily due to 72 interest expense. We had established the valuation allowance against the state NOLs each year as the taxable losses occurred because management concluded that it was more likely than not that the state NOLs would not be realized prior to expiration. The Power the Future generating units will be owned by our subsidiaries organized as LLCs. Once the plants become operational, taxable income or loss of the LLCs will flow through to and be reported in the separate state income tax return of the Parent. As a result, the Parent no longer expects to generate large state losses if all plants are in service. The determination of future state taxable income of the Parent is a significant estimate. Factors affecting the estimate include the ultimate resolution of legal challenges to the construction of the plants, amounts spent and timing for construction of the Power the Future generating units, the amount of debt and interest expense at the Parent and the consideration of available tax planning strategies. We concluded at December 31, 2003 it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets related to state NOLs would expire before being realized. If we would conclude in a future period that it was more likely than not that some or all of the state NOLs would be realized before expiration, generally accepted accounting principles would require that we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported as an increase or decrease in income.
