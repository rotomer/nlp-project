We disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements. CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We seek to increase shareholder value by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is Power the Future. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsins growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental performance. Our Power the Future strategy, which is discussed further below, is expected to have a significant impact on our utility and non utility energy segments. In July 2005, the first of four new electric generating units under our Power the Future strategy was placed into service. Since 2000, we have been selling our non core assets to direct more attention to the utility business and to finance Power the Future while reduc ing our debt. Utility Energy Segment: We are realizing operating efficiencies in this segment through the integration of the operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. These operating efficiencies should increase customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs. In connection with our Power the Future strategy, we are improving our existing energy distribution systems and upgrading existing electric generating assets. In 2005, we increased our generating capacity by 545 megawatts with the completion of the first unit under the Power the Future strategy, and we plan to continue increasing our generating capacity through three additional electric generating units that We Power is constructing. 36 Non Utility Energy Segment: Our primary focus in this segment is to improve the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease new generation assets under the Power the Future strategy. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, we filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) that would allow us to begin implementing our 10 year Power the Future strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. Power the Future is intended to meet a growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under Power the Future, we plan to add new coal fired and natural gas fired generating capacity to the states power portfolio which would allow Wisconsin Electric to maintain approximately the same fuel mix as exists today. As part of our Power the Future strategy, we plan to (1) invest approximately $2.6 billion in 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrade Wisconsin Electrics existing electric generating facilities and (3) invest in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. Subsequent to our February 2001 filing, the state legislature amended several laws, making changes which were critical to the implementation of Power the Future. In October 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with Power the Future and for us to incur the associated pre certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the PSCW in order to be recovered. In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin Electric will lease each new generating facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the initial investments in We Powers new facilities over the initial lease term. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. Wisconsin Electric expects that payments under the plant leases will be recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law. Under our Power the Future strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through We Powers construction of the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS) and the Oak Creek expansion. As of December 31, 2005, we: Received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the PSCW to build two 545 megawatt natural gas fired intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin. The first unit was placed into service in July 2005 and is fully operational. Unit 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. The second unit is expected to be operational in 2008. Began site preparation for the second 545 megawatt generating unit in Port Washington in May 2004. Received a CPCN from the PSCW to build two 615 megawatt coal fired base load units adjacent to the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant in Oak Creek, Wisconsin (the Oak Creek expansion), with the first unit expected to be in service in 2009 and the second unit in 2010. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental permits. We have received all permits necessary to commence construction. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site. Completed the planned sale in November 2005 of approximately a 17% ownership interest in the Oak Creek expansion to two co owners. Received approval from the PSCW for various leases between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We expect to finance the majority of our Power the Future strategy with internally generated cash and debt financings. Additionally, in the future we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly below 37 the prior five year level. We expect to maintain our debt to total capital ratio, excluding environmental trust securities that we may issue, at no more than 61.5% during the period we are constructing our new gas and coal fired generation plants. We currently do not plan to issue any new equity as part of our Power the Future financing plan. Our primary risks under Power the Future are construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for both our Oak Creek expansion and the PWGS, continuing legal challenges to permits obtained and changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, obtaining the investment capital from outside sources necessary to implement the strategy, governmental actions and events in the global economy. For further information concerning Power the Future capital requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. You can find additional information regarding risks associated with the Power the Future strategy, as well as the regulatory process, and specific regulatory approvals in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Divestiture of Assets Our Power the Future strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily included non utility generation assets located outside of Wisconsin and a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio, as well as our manufacturing business. In addition, in 2001 we contributed our transmission assets to the American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) and received cash proceeds of $119.8 million and an economic interest in ATC. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the divestiture of assets as follows: Proceeds from divestitures: (Millions of Dollars) Manufacturing $857.0 Non Utility Energy 616.8 Real Estate 442.1 Transmission 119.8 Other 33.5 Total $2,069.2 38 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Prior periods reported in this table have been restated to reflect discontinued operations. The following table identifies significant items that are included in our Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations. 2005 2004 2003 Asset Valuation Charge $ $ $0.32 Voluntary Severance Program $ $0.16 $ Debt Redemption Costs $ $0.13 $ Reduction of Tax Valuation Allowance ($0.14) $ $ An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results in 2005, 2004 and 2003 follow. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2005 vs. 2004: Our utility energy segment contributed $542.4 million of operating income during 2005 compared with $528.6 million of operating income during 2004. During 2005, we experienced an increase in revenues due to favorable weather and pricing increases. Also, during 2004, we recorded severance costs under a voluntary severance program. The year to year increase in operating income was partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs and increased operation and maintenance expenses during 2005. We had two scheduled outages at our nuclear plant in 2005 in comparison to one scheduled outage in 2004. 2004 vs. 2003: Our utility energy segment contributed $528.6 million of operating income during 2004 compared with $544.1 million of operating income during 2003. During 2004, we experienced an increase in revenues due to 39 base electric sales growth, and we benefited from lower bad debt expenses. However, these items were more than offset by higher pension and medical costs, severance costs recorded during the second half of 2004 and unfavorable weather. The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Utility Energy Segment 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,349.7 $2,099.0 $2,013.6 Gas 1,417.5 1,252.4 1,226.1 Other 25.8 24.0 24.2 Total Operating Revenues 3,793.0 3,375.4 3,263.9 Fuel and Purchased Power 780.8 591.7 569.5 Cost of Gas Sold 1,047.3 890.9 863.3 Gross Margin 1,964.9 1,892.8 1,831.1 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 1,010.4 963.0 891.0 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 324.1 315.5 316.2 Property and Revenue Taxes 88.0 85.7 79.8 Operating Income $542.4 $528.6 $544.1 Electric Utility Gross Margin The following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2005 with similar information for 2004 and 2003, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class.

Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 40 Electric Utility Revenues and Sales 2005 vs. 2004: During 2005, our total electric utility operating revenues increased by $250.7 million or 11.9% when compared with 2004 primarily due to favorable weather during the summer of 2005 and pricing increases. During 2005, we estimate that pricing increases contributed an additional $145.8 million of revenues than in 2004. The most significant impact to rates was a March 2005 interim order received by Wisconsin Electric from the PSCW authorizing an annualized increase in electric rates of approximately $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power. In November 2005, Wisconsin Electric received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $7.7 million of annual revenues. Additional orders impacting rates in 2005 were the May 2004 and May 2005 orders received by Wisconsin Electric from the PSCW authorizing annualized increases in electric rates of approximately $59.0 million and $59.7 million, respectively, primarily to cover construction costs associated with our Power the Future program. Total electric sales increased by 821.8 thousand megawatt hours or 2.6% between 2005 and 2004. Residential sales volumes increased 6.3% due to the favorable summer weather in 2005. Total sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers increased 1.7% between comparative periods. Sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers, excluding our largest customers, two iron ore mines, increased 2.3% due to the favorable weather during the summer of 2005. We estimate that weather increased our electric revenues by approximately $68.8 million during 2005 as compared to the prior year. As measured by cooling degree days, 2005 was 114.7% warmer than in 2004. Sales volumes in the Resale Utilities class decreased 52.6% primarily due to the reduced availability of base load capacity for sale at competitive prices as a result of limited fuel supplies and outages. Sales volumes to municipal utilities, the other retail/municipal customer class, increased 12.8% between the periods due to higher off peak demand from lower margin municipal wholesale power customers. 2004 vs. 2003: During 2004, our total electric utility operating revenues increased by $85.4 million or 4.2% when compared with 2003 due to pricing increases and to growth in our base businesses, partially offset by the effects of unfavorable weather during the summer of 2004. During 2004, we received $54.5 million of higher operating revenues as a result of pricing increases which were not in effect during 2003. In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric received an order from the PSCW authorizing an annualized increase in electric rates of approximately $59.0 million to cover construction costs associated with our Power the Future program and to recover low income uncollectible expenses transferred to Wisconsins public benefits fund. In addition, two rate increases related to a rise in fuel and purchased power costs were implemented in March and October 2003, which increased revenues by approximately $16.3 million during 2004. Total electric sales increased by 465.0 thousand megawatt hours or 1.5% between 2004 and 2003. Residential sales were down 0.6%, and small commercial/industrial sales were up just 1.1% due to the unfavorable weather during 2004. We estimate that the unfavorable weather reduced our electric revenues by approximately $28.6 million as compared to the prior year and by $20.7 million as compared to normal weather. As measured by cooling degree days, 2004 was 27.1% cooler than in 2003 and 38.1% cooler than normal. However, we estimate that customer growth and higher weather normalized use per customer during 2004 mitigated much of the impact of unfavorable weather. Sales volumes to large commercial/industrial customers improved by 2.5%. Excluding our largest customers, two iron ore mines, sales volumes to our remaining large commercial/industrial customers improved by 1.5%. Sales to municipal utilities, the other retail/municipal customer class, increased 8.1% between the periods due to higher off peak demand from low margin municipal wholesale power customers. Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 2005 vs. 2004: Gross fuel and purchased power costs for our electric utilities increased by a total of $260.8 million during 2005 when compared with 2004. During 2005, we deferred $72.8 million of fuel and purchased power costs which resulted in a net increase of fuel and purchased power expense of $188.0 million or 32.1% during 2005 when compared to 2004. The increase in fuel and purchased power expense was driven by a 2.6% increase in megawatt 41 hour sales and an increase in our average cost of fuel and purchased power from $17.49 per megawatt hour in 2004 to $22.44 per megawatt hour in 2005, or 28.3% between the comparative periods. The increase in our average cost of fuel and purchased power is due primarily to (1) the reduced availability of nuclear generation due to scheduled refueling outages, (2) higher natural gas prices that increased the cost of power supplied by natural gas, (3) the impact of the implementation of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc.s (MISO) bid based energy market (MISO Midwest Market) in April 2005 and (4) limitations on coal supplies due to transportation shortfalls. During 2005, we had two scheduled refueling outages at our nuclear plant and in 2004 we had one scheduled refueling outage. As a result, we had approximately 1,145,000 fewer megawatt hours of nuclear generation in 2005. Our average fuel cost for nuclear generation is approximately $5 per megawatt hour, while the average energy cost for purchased power was approximately $55 per megawatt hour. We estimate that the reduction in nuclear generation resulted in approximately $57 million of increased fuel and purchased power costs in 2005 as compared to 2004. During the 2005 outages we replaced both reactor vessel heads resulting in longer outages. This work, along with other planned maintenance, lasted longer than originally expected due to delays. During 2006, we have one planned refueling outage at our nuclear plant. For more information regarding the scheduled refueling outages, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Nuclear Operations. In 2005, we experienced significant increases in the cost of natural gas used in our own generating assets and in the price of purchased energy which is highly influenced by the price of natural gas. This increase was most significant in the last six months of 2005 due to market related factors including the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The average combined cost per megawatt hour of purchased energy and natural gas fired units in 2005 was 47.7% higher than in 2004, increasing total cost by approximately $77.2 million. In April 2005, we began participating in the MISO Midwest Market which fundamentally changed the way we dispatch our generating units and obtain purchased energy. As part of this new market, we are subject to new types of charges which, among other things, recognize the cost of transmission congestion, megawatt hour losses and other costs associated with operating the generating units in an uneconomic fashion to support the MISO Midwest Market service territory. Because the State of Wisconsin has a constrained transmission system, we believe these costs are higher for us than in other parts of the MISO Midwest Market service territory. The incremental costs associated with the MISO Midwest Market charges identified above were approximately $28 million in 2005. For more information regarding MISO and the MISO Midwest Market, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Industry Restructuring and Competition Electric Transmission and Energy Markets. Our 2005 operations were also adversely impacted by limitations on deliveries of coal supply due to the failure of our primary rail delivery supplier to deliver contracted quantities of coal to our units. The largest limitation was related to critical rail track maintenance in the Powder River basin. This, in turn, resulted in reduced coal deliveries of the coal which primarily serves our Oak Creek and Pleasant Prairie generating units from June through December 2005. In response to the reduced deliveries, we limited the generating capability of these units in off peak periods and purchased more expensive replacement power and, where possible, took measures to purchase and transport higher cost coal in place of contracted supplies. We estimate that this increased our costs by approximately $52 million in 2005. For additional information on the decreased coal deliveries, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Commodity Price R isk below. Under the State of Wisconsin fuel rules, we are allowed to request recovery in fuel revenues if our projected fuel and purchased power costs exceed bands established by the PSCW. In March 2005, we received a rate order that allowed us to increase our annual revenues by $114.9 million (final order received in November 2005 for an annual increase of $122.6 million) due to increased fuel and purchased power costs. As provided under the Wisconsin rules, we are also allowed to request deferral for the costs associated with adverse events which materially impact fuel and purchased power costs which were not anticipated, or for which costs could not be reasonably estimated at the time of the fuel recovery request for consideration in future rate proceedings. During 2005, we deferred approximately $72.8 million of fuel and purchased power costs due to the extended outage at Point Beach Unit 2, the coal delivery problems and increased costs associated with the MISO Midwest Market. During 20 05, we estimate that we under recovered fuel and purchased power costs by $108.4 million before these deferred items. Adjusted for the allowed deferrals, our net under recovered fuel and purchased power costs were approximately $35.6 million. 42 2004 vs. 2003: Total fuel and purchased power expenses for our electric utilities increased by $22.2 million or 3.9% during 2004 when compared with 2003. This increase is primarily due to our 1.5% increase in total megawatt hour sales and to higher coal and purchased capacity costs. Increased availability of several of our coal fired generating units during 2004 mitigated the rise in fuel and purchased power costs. Very cool summer weather significantly reduced our need to use higher cost peak generating units and purchased power during 2004, also mitigating the rise in fuel and purchased power costs between the comparative periods. Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Gas Utility Operations 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,417.5 $1,252.4 $1,226.1 Cost of Gas Sold 1,047.3 890.9 863.3 Gross Margin $370.2 $361.5 $362.8 We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gas cost recovery mechanisms. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Gas Gross Margin Gas Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $240.5 $238.0 $233.0 791.0 809.9 853.7 Commercial/Industrial 72.9 71.9 71.0 460.7 464.0 492.5 Interruptible 1.8 1.8 2.0 23.4 24.7 27.5 Total Gas Sold 315.2 311.7 306.0 1,275.1 1,298.6 1,373.7 Transported Gas 48.5 43.8 41.8 893.7 769.5 797.5 Other Operating 6.5 6.0 15.0 Total $370.2 $361.5 $362.8 2,168.8 2,068.1 2,171.2 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,697 Normal) 6,628 6,663 7,063 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2005 vs. 2004: Gas utility gross margin increased by $8.7 million or 2.4% between comparative periods. This increase reflects $6.5 million of price increases which reflects the full years impact of a $25.9 million annual rate increase, which became effective in March 2004. Total therm deliveries were 4.9% higher during 2005 primarily due to increased transport gas deliveries of 124.2 million therms. Transport volumes increased between the comparative periods due to a higher amount of electric generation from natural gas within our service territory. A portion of these sales are eliminated in consolidation. Our margins on these transport gas volumes are significantly lower than our margins for retail gas sales. The price increases and increased transport volumes were offset, in part, by a decrease in residential therm deliveries. Residential therm deliveries decreased 2.3% as compar ed to 2004, due to slightly warmer weather and a decrease in use per customer that was driven in part by higher commodity prices. As measured by heating degree days, 2005 was less than 1% warmer than 2004. 2004 vs. 2003: Our total gas utility gross margin fell slightly from $362.8 million in 2003 to $361.5 million in 2004 due largely to a decrease in therm deliveries resulting from less favorable weather. Total therm deliveries were 4.7% lower during 2004 primarily due to weather. As measured by heating degree days, 2004 was 5.7% warmer than 2003 and 1.1% warmer than normal, which reduced heating load. We estimate that weather reduced gross 43 margin by approximately $12.9 million between the comparative periods. Our gas margins were favorably impacted by a price increase that became effective in March 2004. This annual price increase of $25.9 million favorably impacted gas margins by $19.6 million in 2004. However, in 2004, we recognized $8.8 million less in gas cost incentive revenues under our gas cost recovery mechanisms when compared with 2003. Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses 2005 vs. 2004: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $47.4 million or 4.9% during 2005 compared with 2004. The most significant changes in our operation and maintenance expense related to increased lease costs and increased nuclear outage costs. Partially offsetting these increases were a charge in 2004 for severance costs related to the voluntary severance program and lower employee costs in 2005 due to fewer employees. The largest operations and maintenance increase for the utility energy segment related to $50.0 million of costs that we recognized under lease agreements between We Power and Wisconsin Electric in connection with our Power the Future plan. Initially, Wisconsin Electric defers the lease payments and then amortizes the payments to expense as we recover revenues from our customers under specific pricing agreements. As noted in the electric revenue discussion, in May 2004 and May 2005 the PSCW approved pricing increases to recover the Wisconsin retail portion of these lease costs. In addition to the increased lease costs, our nuclear operating and maintenance expense increased approximately $11.0 million due to two scheduled refueling outages in 2005 where we also replaced the reactor vessel heads. In 2004, we had one scheduled refueling outage and in 2006 we only have one scheduled refueling outage. This increase was partially offset by a $10.0 million settlement we received to resolve a vendor dispute. Additionally, in 2004 we recognized $28.2 million of severance related costs due to the voluntary severance program that was implemented in the second half of 2004. In 2005, we had approximately 210 fewer employees, which reduced operation and maintenance costs by $12.9 million. Benefit costs increased $7.0 million between comparative periods due to increased pension and medical costs. In October 2005, we announced that we were offering to our retirees a Medicare Advantage program as an option within our existing post retirement medical and drug plans. As a result of the Medicare Advantage program we anticipate that our 2006 post retirement costs will be approximately $13.0 million less than our 2005 costs. However, we expect an increase in our 2006 pension costs to offset this reduction due to lower discount rates and lower than expected historical returns on plan assets. 2004 vs. 2003: Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $72.0 million or 8.1% during 2004 compared with 2003. The largest increase related to $36.3 million of costs that we recognized under a lease agreement in connection our Power the Future plan. In May 2004, the PSCW approved a pricing increase to recover the Wisconsin retail portion of these lease costs. In addition to the lease costs, we also recognized $12.8 million of increased public benefits costs which were also included in the May 2004 price increase. In 2004, our benefit costs increased $15.0 million due to increased pension and medical costs. We also incurred $28.2 million of severance related costs during 2004, primarily due to a voluntary severance program offered to certain management and represented employees in the second half of 2004. Partially offsetting these increases was an $11.9 million reduction in bad debt costs due to improved collections and the timing of a deferral order. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expense 2005 vs. 2004: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense increased by $8.6 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. This increase was primarily due to increased depreciable plant balances. In November 2005, the PSCW approved new depreciation rates which are effective January 1, 2006. We expect the new depreciation rates to reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $17 million due to the lengthening of nuclear plant lives. 2004 vs. 2003: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense decreased by $0.7 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. This slight decrease was due to a $7.7 million reduction in decommissioning expense in 2004 44 due to the tax impacts associated with rebalancing the nuclear decommissioning trusts. This decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation expense on increased depreciable plant balances. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME Effective May 31, 2005, we sold our Calumet facility, which was previously included in the operations of the non utility energy segment. As a result of this sale, we have determined that the Calumet operations meet the definition of discontinued operations under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. All periods presented have been restated to exclude the results of the Calumet operations. See Results of Operations Discontinued Operations below for further information. The most significant subsidiary included in this segment is We Power, which constructs and owns power plants associated with our Power the Future plan and leases them to Wisconsin Electric. This segment reflects revenues billed under the PWGS Unit 1 lease and the depreciation expense related to PWGS Unit 1. The following table compares our non utility energy segments operating income (loss) during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Non Utility Energy Segment 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $40.0 $19.9 $12.3 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 14.4 12.9 16.2 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 5.9 1.4 1.3 Property and Revenue Taxes 0.2 1.0 1.5 Asset Valuation Charges, Net 49.0 Operating Income (Loss) $19.5 $4.6 ($55.7) 2005 vs. 2004: Our non utility energy segment had operating income of $19.5 million during 2005 compared with $4.6 million during 2004. The increase in operating income between the comparative periods is primarily due to Unit 1 at PWGS commencing service in July 2005. This unit had operating income of $18.9 million during its six months of operation in 2005. 2004 vs. 2003: Our non utility energy segment had operating income of $4.6 million during 2004 compared with an operating loss of $55.7 million in 2003. During 2003, we recorded $59.5 million of non cash asset valuation charges related to our investment in an entity that owns a co generation plant in Maine (Androscoggin) and to a natural gas power island which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2003, we also realized gains on the sale of non utility energy assets of $10.5 million. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME In August 2005, we announced our intent to sell our Minergy Neenah facility, which was previously included in the operations of corporate and other affiliates. As a result of this announcement, we have determined that the Minergy Neenah operations meet the definition of discontinued operations under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. All periods presented have been restated to exclude the results of Minergy Neenah operations. See Results of Operations Discontinued Operations below for further information. This segment primarily reflects the operations of Wispark and holding company costs that are not allocated to subsidiaries. 2005 vs. 2004: Corporate and other affiliates had operating income of $1.0 million in 2005 compared with an operating loss of $3.2 million in 2004. The improved results reflect increased earnings from Wispark. However, we are reducing our Wispark assets and we expect to see lower Wispark earnings in the future. 2004 vs. 2003: We had net corporate and other affiliates operating losses of $3.2 million during 2004 compared with net operating losses of $4.3 million in 2003. 45 CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET The following table identifies the components of consolidated other income and deductions, net during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Other Income and Deductions, Net 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Equity in Earnings of ATC $34.6 $30.1 $26.0 Carrying Costs on Deferred Transmission Charges 20.5 13.9 9.3 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction 9.2 2.8 5.1 Debt Redemption Costs (22.9) Other, net (1.0) (8.1) 1.3 Total Other Income and Deductions, Net $63.3 $15.8 $41.7 2005 vs. 2004: Other income and deductions, net increased by $47.5 million in 2005 compared to 2004. In 2004, we recognized $22.9 million of debt redemption costs associated with the early redemption of approximately $500 million of long term debt. Similar debt redemption costs were not incurred in 2005. We recognized higher carrying costs on deferred electric transmission costs of $6.6 million. The allowance for funds used during construction increased $6.4 million in 2005 due to a higher average balance of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) qualifying utility construction projects in 2005. 2004 vs. 2003: Other income and deductions, net decreased by $25.9 million in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to $22.9 million of debt redemption costs incurred during 2004. In connection with the sale of our manufacturing business, we used approximately $500 million of the sales proceeds for early redemption of long term debt. CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE 2005 vs. 2004: Total interest expense decreased by $20.0 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects lower average debt levels in 2005 as compared to 2004. During 2004, we reduced debt levels by $654.2 million primarily with proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing segment. However, due to the increased construction activity our year end debt balances have increased by $291.9 million. To the extent that we incur debt associated with construction in progress, we capitalize the interest costs in accordance with our accounting policies. 2004 vs. 2003: Total interest expense decreased by $20.4 million in 2004 compared with 2003. This decrease primarily reflects the reduction in debt levels due to the retirement of debt with the proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing business, which was effective July 31, 2004. From December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004, we reduced our debt levels by $654.2 million or 15%. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 2005 vs. 2004: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 33.0% in 2005 compared to 37.7% in 2004. In 2005, we reversed $16.3 million of valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding this nonrecurring item, our effective tax rate was 36.6%. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 vs. 2003: In 2004, our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 37.7% compared with a 35.5% rate during 2003. The increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the inability to deduct state income taxes on losses of certain non utility subsidiaries. 46 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Our discontinued operations include our manufacturing operations which were sold effective July 31, 2004, our Calumet facility which was sold in May 2005 and our Minergy Neenah facility. As of December 31, 2005, we are considering offers to sell our Minergy Neenah facility. The following table identifies the primary components of income from discontinued operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003. Discontinued Operations 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Manufacturing $ $184.2 $43.9 Non Utility and Other 5.1 (97.4) (0.9) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net $5.1 $86.8 $43.0 Our 2005 earnings from discontinued operations reflect a gain on the sale of the Calumet facility, the favorable resolution of liabilities at Calumet and an adjustment to the carrying value of Minergy Neenah. Our 2004 earnings from discontinued operations reflect an after tax gain of $152.3 million on the sale of our manufacturing business. Our 2004 earnings from discontinued operations also reflect valuation charges of $79.3 million after tax related to Calumet and $17.6 million after tax related to Minergy Neenah. Our 2003 earnings from discontinued operations reflect net operating earnings of $43.9 million related to our manufacturing segment. See Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the transactions described above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2005, 2004 and 2003: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $576.9 $599.0 $528.9 Investing Activities ($697.1) $242.8 ($595.2) Financing Activities $157.8 ($834.3) $59.4 Operating Activities Cash provided by continuing operating activities decreased to $576.9 million during 2005 compared with $599.0 million during 2004. This decline reflected increased working capital needs for our utility business and an increase in deferred costs, offset in part by lower cash taxes and increased cash earnings. During 2005, we experienced significant increases in natural gas costs which increased our working capital requirements for natural gas in storage. The increased natural gas costs also led to an increase in accounts receivable as the cost of gas is recovered dollar for dollar in our natural gas revenues. During 2005, we also experienced increased deferred costs related to transmission costs and deferred fuel. We would not expect similar levels of deferred transmission costs in 2006 as we received a rate order in January 2006 which increased our recoveries of transmission costs by 47 approximately $67.5 million per year. The deferred fuel costs related primarily to an extended outage at our nuclear plant, increased costs associated with problems in our vendors ability to deliver coal via the railroad system and costs related to the implementation of the MISO Midwest Market. During 2005, our cash taxes were lower than 2004 due to the ability to realize tax benefits on the sale of non utility assets and accelerated tax depreciation on PWGS Unit 1. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $599.0 million during 2004 compared with $528.9 million during the same period in 2003. This increase was due in large part to stronger cash earnings (net earnings plus non cash valuation charges) as well as improvements in working capital. Investing Activities During 2005, we had $697.1 million of net cash outflows from investing activities. In 2004, we had net cash inflows from investing activities of $242.8 million and in 2003 we had net cash outflows of $595.2 million. In 2005, capital expenditures increased related to our Power the Future plan at We Power and for compliance with the consent decree entered into with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Environmental Matters). In addition, expenditures associated with nuclear fuel purchases were higher during 2005. In 2004, we recognized proceeds of $857.0 million for the sale of our manufacturing segment. The following table identifies capital expenditures by year: Capital Expenditures 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $458.6 $426.5 $455.6 Non Utility Energy 276.6 191.0 163.6 Other 9.9 19.0 28.8 Total Capital Expenditures $745.1 $636.5 $648.0 We Power, which is included in the Non Utility Energy segment, had capital expenditures of $275.1 million, $190.4 million and $162.9 million for the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In connection with our growth strategy which was announced in 2000, we have been focusing on divesting non core assets and investing in core regulated assets. As a result, the sale of assets is a significant component of our investing activities. The following table identifies cash proceeds from asset sales: Asset Sales 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Real Estate $54.5 $38.7 $17.4 Wisvest 37.1 37.7 We Power 34.6 Manufacturing 857.0 Other 7.6 3.9 0.2 Total Asset Sales $133.8 $899.6 $55.3 48 Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of Dollars) Increase (Reduce) Debt $291.9 ($654.2) $120.7 Dividends on Common Stock (102.9) (97.8) (93.7) Common Stock, net (28.1) (81.8) 56.1 Other (3.1) (0.5) (23.7) Cash Provided by (Used in ) Financing $157.8 ($834.3) $59.4 During 2005, cash provided by financing activities was $157.8 million compared to $834.3 million of cash used for financing activities during 2004. In 2005, the primary uses of cash were to pay dividends on common stock and to purchase common stock to satisfy benefit plan obligations. In July 2005, PWGS issued $155.0 million of 4.91% senior notes in a private placement. The senior notes have a mortgage style repayment feature and have an average life approximating 15 years. The final payment is due July 15, 2030. Proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used primarily to repay short term debt incurred during construction at PWGS. For further information, see Note E Port Washington Generating Station in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Wisconsin Gas retired at the scheduled maturity date $65 million of 6 3/8% Notes due November 1, 2005. In November 2005, Wisconsin Gas issued $90 million of 5.90% Debentures due December 1, 2035. The securities were issued under shelf registration statements filed with the SEC. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. The commercial paper was incurred to both retire the $65 million of 6 3/8% Notes and for working capital requirements. During 2004, the proceeds from asset sales as well as improved cash flows from operations allowed us to retire $654.2 million of debt, including $200 million of 6.85% Trust Preferred Securities and $300 million of 5.875% senior notes due April 1, 2006. In September 2000, the Board of Directors amended the common stock repurchase program to authorize us to purchase up to $400 million of our shares of common stock in the open market. In March 2004, we announced that under this plan we would resume purchasing approximately $50 million of our common shares in the open market with the proceeds from the sale of the manufacturing business, which was effective July 31, 2004. During 2004, we purchased approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock for $50.4 million under this plan. We ceased repurchasing shares in October 2004. The program expired in December 2004. Over the life of the plan we repurchased and retired 14.9 million shares at a cost of $344.0 million. No new shares of common stock were issued in 2005. During January and February 2004, we issued approximately 0.2 million new shares of common stock in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. In 2003, we issued approximately 2.7 million new shares of common stock in connection with these plans. In 2004 and 2003, we received payments aggregating $4.8 million and $62.9 million, respectively. In February 2004, we announced that we did not expect to issue new shares under these programs; rather we instructed the independent plan agents to begin purchasing the shares in the open market in lieu of issuing new shares. During 2005 and 2004, our plan agents purchased 2.0 million shares at a cost of $75.1 million and 3.2 million shares at a cost of $102.3 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options. In 2005, we received proceeds of $47.0 million related to the exercise of stock options compared with $66.1&nbsp ;million in 2004. Prior to February 2004, we issued new shares to fulfill these obligations. 49 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among other things, called for us to sell non core assets and reduce our debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 59.5% at December 31, 2005 due primarily to asset sales. Over the next several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly lower than the previous six year level. In 2002, we initiated the construction of the first of our four planned generating units under our Power the Future program. The first unit at PWGS was completed and placed into service in July 2005. We expect to spend approximately $1.9 billion to complete construction of the remaining three generating units. Over the next several years, we expect to fund these plants with cash from operations and debt offerings. Capital Resources We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2006 and the next several years primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We have access to capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our borrowing arrangements and internally generated cash. In March 2004, the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law a measure that gives utilities the ability to securitize the portion of customer bills that recovers the cost of certain investments intended to improve the environment. The measure would result in a lower cost to customers when compared to traditional financing and ratemaking. In June 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW that sought authority to issue up to $500 million of environmental trust bonds pursuant to this legislation. In October 2004, the PSCW approved an order authorizing Wisconsin Electric to issue environmental trust bonds to finance the recovery of $425 million of environmental control costs plus up front financing costs. The proposed terms of the bonds are subject to further PSCW approval prior to issuance. We will continue to evaluate the potential issuance of environmental trust bonds. Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas credit agreements provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available unused lines of bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis and approximately $456.3 million of total consolidated short term debt outstanding. We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2005: Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Maturity Facility Term (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $300.0 $ $300.0 June 2007 3 year Wisconsin Energy $300.0 $1.8 $298.2 Apr 2006 3 year Wisconsin Electric $250.0 $7.0 $243.0 June 2007 3 year Wisconsin Electric $125.0 $ $125.0 Nov 2007 3 year Wisconsin Gas $200.0 $ $200.0 June 2007 3 year Each of these facilities may be extended for an additional 364 days beyond the date of expiration, subject to lender agreement. We are currently in the process of renewing Wisconsin Energys $300 million credit facility which expires on April 8, 2006. In addition, we are also reviewing the possibility of amending and extending the other existing Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas credit facilities. 50 The following table shows our consolidated capitalization structure at December 31: Capitalization Structure 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $2,680.1 40.0% $2,492.4 40.2% Preferred Stock of Subsidiaries 30.4 0.5% 30.4 0.5% Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 3,527.0 52.7% 3,340.5 53.9% Short Term Debt 456.3 6.8% 338.0 5.4% Total $6,693.8 100.0% $6,201.3 100.0% Ratio of Debt to Total Capital 59.5% 59.3% As described in Note J Common Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Fitch as of December 31, 2005. S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Unsecured Senior Debt BBB+ A3 A Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Secured Senior Debt A Aa3 AA Unsecured Debt A A1 A+ Preferred Stock BBB A3 A Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A1 A+ Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt BBB+ A3 A On March 29, 2005, S&P affirmed the security ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and changed the security ratings outlook from stable to negative for all three companies. The security rating outlooks assigned by Moodys and Fitch for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are all stable. In March 2003, S&P lowered its corporate credit ratings for us from A to BBB+ and for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both from A to A . S&P lowered its ratings for our senior unsecured debt from A to BBB+; for Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt from A to A and for Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt from A to A . S&P affirmed Wisconsin Electrics A senior unsecured debt rating. S&P lowered the rating for our preferred stock from BBB to BBB and for Wisconsin Electrics preferred stock from BBB+ to BBB. S&P affirmed the A 2 short term rating of us and lowered the short term ratings of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from A 1 to A 2. Wisconsin Electrics senior secured and senior unsecured debt are both rated A by S&P. S&P assigned a stable outlook. In October 2003, Moodys downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Moodys lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation 51 from A2 to A3 and our commercial paper rating from P 1 to P 2. Moodys lowered Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt rating from Aa2 to Aa3, senior unsecured debt rating from Aa3 to A1 and preferred stock rating from A2 to A3. Moodys lowered Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt rating from Aa2 to A1. Moodys confirmed the P 1 commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In February 2004, Moodys changed the rating outlook for Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation to stable from negative. In October 2003, Fitch downgraded certain of our security ratings and the security ratings of our subsidiaries. Fitch lowered the senior unsecured debt ratings of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from A to A and the commercial paper rating of Wisconsin Energy from F1 to F2. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Electrics senior secured debt rating from AA to AA , senior unsecured rating from AA to A+ and preferred stock rating from AA to A. Fitch lowered Wisconsin Gas senior unsecured debt rating from AA to A+. Fitch lowered the commercial paper ratings of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from F1+ to F1. We believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Capital Requirements Our current estimated 2006, 2007 and 2008 capital expenditures, excluding the purchase of nuclear fuel, are as follows: Capital Expenditures Actual 2005 Estimated 2006 Estimated 2007 Estimated 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $458.6 $503.0 $450.0 $500.0 Non Utility Energy 276.6 512.5 675.0 475.0 Other 9.9 4.5 Total $745.1 $1,020.0 $1,125.0 $975.0 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. Our estimated capital requirements through 2010 for Power the Future include approximately $2.6 billion to construct 2,120 megawatts of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity of which we have expended approximately $673.9 million through the end of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest (200 megawatts) in the Oak Creek expansion to two parties, at which time we received approximately $34.6 million in cash. The co owners will share ratably in the construction costs. Total output of all four units, including the two unaffiliated entities portion, is 2,320 megawatts. We expect the capital requirements to support our investment in new generation under Power the Future to come from a combination of internal and external sources. We Power, a non utility subsidiary, is constructing the new generating plants, which will be leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25 30 year lease agreements. We expect that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. In June 2005, we purchased the development rights to two wind farm projects from Navitas Energy Inc. We plan to develop the wind sites and construct wind turbines with a combined generating capability between 130 to 200 megawatts at a cost in the range of $250 to $320 million. We anticipate the cost to build the wind farm projects would be recovered in our rates. We plan to file the necessary regulatory and environmental applications in 2006. 52 We expect the turbines to be placed in service between 2007 and 2008 dependent upon the availability of wind turbines and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Investments in Outside Trusts: We have funded our pension obligations, certain other post retirement obligations and future nuclear obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had investments that exceeded $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2005. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. For further information see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For further information, see Note P Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have identified three tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties but have been unable to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of any of these three variable interest entities as defined by Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. Instead, we account for one of these contracts as a capital lease and for the other two contracts as operating leases as reflected in the table below. We have included our contractual obligations under all three of these contracts in our Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments disclosure that follows. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $5,944.6 $639.7 $896.7 $299.2 $4,109.0 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 577.6 60.3 102.8 81.7 332.8 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 225.1 51.1 84.9 40.8 48.3 Purchase Obligations (e) 2,835.7 758.7 1,468.2 423.4 185.4 Other Long Term Liabilities 3.8 1.4 0.9 1.5 Total Contractual Obligations $9,586.8 $1,511.2 $2,553.5 $846.6 $4,675.5 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Principal and interest payments on our Long Term Debt and the Long Term Debt of our affiliates (excluding capital lease obligations). (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for nuclear fuel lease and purchase power commitments. (d) Operating Lease Obligations for purchased power and rail car leases for Wisconsin Energy and affiliates. (e) Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. Obligations for utility operations by our utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. For a discussion of 2006, 2007 and 2008 estimated capital expenditures, see Capital Requirements above. 53 FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Construction Risk: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of two 545 megawatt natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The order approved key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed construction costs of the PWGS at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars), respectively, subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate, force majeure, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future Port Washington below. In addition, in November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 megawatt super critical pulverized coal generating units (Oak Creek expansion) adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including a target construction cost of the Oak Creek expansion of $2.191 billion, plus, subject to PSCW approval, cost over runs of up to 5%, costs attributable to force majeure events, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion below. Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, continuing legal challenges to permits obtained, changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, governmental actions and events in the global economy. If final costs for the construction of PWGS exceed the fixed costs allowed in the PSCW order, absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force majeure conditions, this excess will not adjust the amount of the lease payments recovered from Wisconsin Electric. If final costs of the Oak Creek expansion are within 5% of the target cost, and the additional costs are deemed to be prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs. Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force majeure conditions. Regulatory Recovery Risk: The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in its leased power plants, in several of its peaking power plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants. In addition, the cost of purchased power is generally tied to the cost of natural gas. Wisconsin Electric bears regulatory risk for the recovery of these fuel and purchased power costs when these costs are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. As noted below in Commodity Price Risk, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity. Since our merger with WICOR in 2000 through December 31, 2005, we were allowed to request recovery of fuel and purchased power costs from retail electric customers in the Wisconsin jurisdiction through our rate review process with the PSCW and in interim fuel cost hearings when such annualized costs were expected to be more than 3% higher than the forecasted costs used to establish rates. In January 2006, the PSCW approved a plan for Wisconsin Electric to refund any over collection of fuel costs on an annual basis for 2006 to Wisconsin ratepayers and any under collection will be subject to a 2% band. Beginning in 2007, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric will operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wi sconsin retail jurisdiction for under and over collection within a 2% band. 54 For 2005, 2004 and 2003, actual net fuel and purchased power costs at Wisconsin Electric exceeded fuel costs included in rates by $35.6 million, $0.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. SFAS 71 allows regulated entities to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis fo r amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. Under SFAS 71, we record these items as regulatory liabilities. Commodity Price Risk: In the normal course of business, our utility and non utility power generation subsidiaries utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sale and purchase of electricity. This is done to optimize utilization of their available generating capacity and energy during periods when available power resources are projected to be greater than or less than our load obligations. This practice may also include forward contracts for the purchase of power during periods when the anticipated market price of electric energy is below expected incremental power production costs. In addition, effective April 1, 2005, our electric utilities became market participants in the MISO Midwest Market. For additional information on the MISO Midwest Market see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Other Utility Rate Matters and Industry Restructuring and Competition Electric Transmission and Energy Markets below. We manage our fuel and gas supply cost s through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, uranium, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage our natural gas price risk by utilizing a gas hedging program. In July 2005, we received a letter from Union Pacific Corporation notifying us that a force majeure event requiring maintenance on a Union Pacific railroad line was expected to result in a 15 20% reduction in the amount of contracted deliveries of Powder River Basin coal to certain of our coal generating facilities from June 2005 through November 2005. In response, we reduced generation at certain coal fueled units, primarily during lower cost off peak periods, to conserve coal inventories. This required us to obtain additional megawatt hour purchases through other potentially higher cost generating resources in the MISO Midwest Market. In August 2005, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to defer incremental fuel costs associated with reduced coal deliveries. Through December 31, 2005, we deferred approximately $26.0 million of incremental fuel costs and we expect to recover these costs in future rates, subjec t to review and approval of the PSCW. We do not expect to defer any additional costs related to this matter. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted, subject to risks associated with the regulatory approval process including regulatory lag. Regulatory lag risk occurs between the time we incur costs in excess of what we collect in rates, and the time we receive approval for interim rates following a regulatory filing. Regulatory risk can increase or decrease due to many factors which may also change during this approval period including commodity price fluctuations, unscheduled operating outages or unscheduled maintenance. In 2002, the PSCW authorized the inclusion of price risk management financial instruments for the management of our electrical utility gas costs. During 2003, a gas hedging program was approved by the PSCW and implemented by Wisconsin Electric. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for the gas utility operations of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For additional information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities gas cost recovery mechanisms, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters below. Natural Gas Costs: Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Natural gas costs have increased significantly, both because the supply of natural gas in recent years has not kept 55 pace with the demand for natural gas and due to the impacts of hurricanes on offshore Gulf of Mexico natural gas production. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas is added to the nations energy supply mix. Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the State of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have not kept pace with rising natural gas costs, our risks related to bad debt expenses associated with non paying customers has increased. In February 2005, the PSCW authorized the use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceed amounts allowed in rates. In 2004 and 2003, we had approval from the PSCW to defer residential bad debt net write offs that exceed amounts allowed in rates. As a result of gas cost recovery mechanisms, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. In addition, we are experiencing reduced usage of natural gas by our residential customers, who contribute higher margins than other customer classes, due to the increased natural gas costs. We expect to continue to experience this reduced usage during the 2006 winter heating season. Weather: The rates of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. The gas revenues of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2005, 2004 and 2003, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations. Interest Rate Risk: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2005. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2005 of our outstanding portfolio of $456.3 million of short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.39% and $189.8 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.77%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $4.6 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $1.9 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return Risk: We fund our pension, other post retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market price of the assets in these trust funds can affect future pension, other post retirement benefit and nuclear decommissioning expenses. Future contributions to these trust funds can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of expense and contribution variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. Through December 31, 2005, we were operating under a PSCW ordered, qualified five year rate restriction period. For further information about the rate restriction, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters below. At December 31, 2005, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments. Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $976.9 Nuclear decommissioning trust funds $782.1 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $186.0 56 Fiduciary oversight of the pension and other post retirement plan trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor. The current study for the pension fund projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 8.5%. Fiduciary oversight for the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments is also the responsibility of the Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are also engaged to manage these investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor, subject to additional constraints established by the PSCW. The current study projects long term, annualized returns of approximately 9%. Current PSCW constraints allow a maximum allocation of 65% in equities. Wisconsin Electric insures various property and outage risks through Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). Annually, NEIL reviews its underwriting and investment results and determines the feasibility of granting a distribution to policyholders. Adverse loss experience, rising reinsurance costs or impaired investment results at NEIL could result in increased costs or decreased distributions to Wisconsin Electric. Credit Rating Risk: We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity and energy services contracts and employee benefit plans that could require, in the event of a credit ratings change to below investment grade, a termination payment if collateral is not provided or an accelerated payment. At December 31, 2005, we estimate that the potential payments under these agreements that could result from credit rating downgrades totaled approximately $78.2 million. Economic Risk: We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment. Inflationary Risk: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. Except for continuance of an increasing trend in the inflation of medical costs and the impacts on our medical and post retirement benefit plans, we have expectations of low to moderate inflation. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material effect on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see Cautionary Factors below and Risk Factors in Item 1A above. POWER THE FUTURE Under our Power the Future strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion by We Power. We Power will lease the new plants to Wisconsin Electric under long term leases, and we expect Wisconsin Electric to recover the lease payments in its electric rates. Power the Future Port Washington Background: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of two 545 megawatt natural gas fired combined cycle generating units (PWGS Units 1 and 2) on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The Port Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral, which was completed in December 2004, and American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) to construct required transmission system upgrades to serve PWGS Units 1 and 2 as a result of their concurrent applications. PWGS Unit 1 was completed in July 2005 and placed into service at that time. Unit 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. In October 2003, we received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to transfer by long term lease certain associated FERC jurisdiction al transmission related assets from We Power to Wisconsin Electric. We Power began site preparation of Unit 2 in May 2004. We expect Unit 2 to be operational in 2008. 57 Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS Units 1 and 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% on equity; Fixed construction cost of the PWGS Units 1 and 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to defer costs for recovery in future rates. The PSCW approved the request in an open meeting in April 2003. We Power began collecting certain costs from Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of 2003 as provided for in lease generation contracts that were signed in May 2003. We defer the lease costs on our balance sheet, and we amortize the costs to expense as we recover the costs in rates. Legal and Regulatory Matters: There are currently no legal challenges to the construction of the PWGS and all construction permits have been received for Units 1 and 2. As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act) the FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. Under the FERCs recently issued rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Electric will be required to seek FERC authorization in order to lease the remaining PWGS unit prior to the unit being placed into service. We are unable to determine at this time the magnitude of the impact of this new regulatory requirement on the Power the Future plan, if any. Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion Background: In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Oak Creek Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 megawatt coal fired units (the Oak Creek expansion) to be located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. We anticipate the first unit will be operational in 2009 and the second unit will be operational in 2010. The Oak Creek Order concluded, among other things, that there was a need for additional electric generation for Southeastern Wisconsin and that a diversity of fuel sources best serves the interests of the State. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental permits. All necessary permits have been received at this time. In June&n bsp;2005, construction commenced at the site. In November 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest in the project to two unaffiliated entities, who will share ratably in the construction costs. Lease Terms: In October 2004, the PSCW approved the lease generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power for the Oak Creek expansion. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% on equity; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Oak Creek Order, which do not include the key financial terms. 58 In April 2004, the PSCW approved the deferral of certain costs related to the Oak Creek expansion for recovery in future rates. (See Limited Rate Adjustment Request below for further information). Legal and Regulatory Matters: The CPCN granted for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion was the subject of a number of legal challenges by third parties; these legal challenges were resolved in June 2005. We have received all permits necessary to commence construction. Certain of these permits continue to be contested, but remain in effect unless and until overturned by a reviewing court or administrative law judge. The major permits are discussed below. In November 2004, a Dane County Circuit Court judge reviewing challenges to the PSCWs order authorizing us to build two coal fired generating facilities on the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant vacated the CPCN and remanded it back to the PSCW for additional proceedings. The Court determined that the PSCW committed errors in determining the completeness of our application and in its decisions on several other points. The Dane County Circuit Courts decision was appealed and in June 2005, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued its decision which reversed the Dane County Circuit Courts decision that vacated the PSCW order authorizing us to build the Oak Creek expansion and upheld the PSCWs order in all respects. The CPCN granted by the PSCW was reinstated and is in full force and effect. As a result of the delay to the start of construction caused by litigation, the project cost is expected to increase by $50 to $55 million. This represents an increase of approximately 2.4% to 2.6% in the total cost of the project. We believe these costs are ultimately recoverable under the terms of the lease agreements between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. However, recovery is subject to our final calculation of costs and also to review and approval by the PSCW. In September 2003, several parties filed a request with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) for a contested case hearing in connection with our application to the WDNR for a Chapter 30 permit for wetlands and waterways alterations and construction on the bed of Lake Michigan for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion. That request was granted and assigned to an administrative law judge. The hearing took place in August 2004 and in November 2004, the administrative law judge approved the WDNRs issuance of the Chapter 30 permit for the Oak Creek expansion. In December 2004, opponents filed a petition for review of the decision in Dane County Circuit Court. In January 2005, we filed a motion to dismiss the opponents petition based on procedural errors. The WDNR joined in this motion. In March 2005, the court dismissed the appeal. The opponents appealed the courts dismissal to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. In February 2006, the Wisconsin Court of App eals affirmed the lower courts dismissal of the case. The opponents can seek reconsideration of the courts decision or can petition the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review. We applied to the WDNR to modify the existing Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit that is required for operation of the water intake and discharge system for the planned Oak Creek expansion and existing Oak Creek generating units. In March 2005, the WDNR determined that the proposed cooling water intake structure and water discharge system meets regulatory requirements and reissued the WPDES permit with specific limitations and conditions. The opponents filed a petition for judicial review in Dane County Circuit Court and a request for a contested case proceeding with the WDNR. In September 2005, the judicial review proceeding in Dane County Circuit Court was dismissed. All parties to this action agreed to the dismissal. The WDNR granted a contested case hearing and the administrative law judge has scheduled a hearing for March 2006. We anticipate a decision by the administrative law judge in 2006. In May 2005, we received the Army Corps of Engineers federal permit necessary for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion. Opponents may appeal the permit in federal court. In January 2004, the WDNR issued the Air Pollution Control Construction Permit (Air Permit) to Wisconsin Electric for the Oak Creek expansion. The permit was opposed and a contested case hearing with the WDNR was held in October 2004. In February 2005, an administrative law judge issued a decision affirming the WDNR January 2004 issuance of the Air Permit. The decision was opposed and project opponents filed a petition for judicial review with the Dane County Circuit Court. In September 2005, the Dane County Circuit Court dismissed with prejudice the appeal of the administrative law judges decision. All parties to this action agreed to the dismissal. This dismissal is the final resolution of all legal challenges to the issuance of the Air Permit. 59 In addition, as a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act the FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to the FERCs jurisdiction. Under the FERCs recently issued rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Electric will be required to seek FERC authorization in order to lease the two units that are part of the Oak Creek expansion prior to the units being placed into service. We are unable to determine at this time the magnitude of the impact of this new regulatory requirement on the Power the Future plan, if any. UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the State of Wisconsin, while the FERC regulates wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) regulates retail electric rates in the State of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 87% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 8% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues are regulated by the FERC. All of our natural gas revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. Overview: For the period from March 2000 until December 31, 2005, the rates of We Energies (the trade name of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas) were governed by an order from the PSCW in connection with the approval of the WICOR acquisition. Under this order, We Energies was restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a five year period ending December 31, 2005, with certain limited exceptions. Wisconsin Electric: In July 2005, we filed an electric and steam price increase request with the PSCW. Under a limited rate proceeding, we requested an increase in electric rates of $143.6 million for 2006, and an $8.8 million total increase in rates for steam over the two year period of 2006 and 2007. The requested electric rate increase included: (1) costs associated with the continued investment in our Power the Future strategy; (2) recovery of transmission costs incurred that exceed the amount we are currently collecting from customers; (3) additional sources of renewable energy; and (4) a rate freeze for day to day operations of the electric system until 2008. The requested steam rate increase was due to (1) the costs of maintaining the steam system, (2) the cost of fuel and (3) the costs associated with making changes to our steam utility operations as part of the reconstruction of the Marquette Interc hange project in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Subsequent to the initial filing of this pricing request, we experienced a significant increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power due to the increases in natural gas prices and the reductions in coal deliveries as discussed above. In October 2005, we filed a letter with the PSCW informing them of our need to include the increased cost of natural gas used for generation of electricity in our pending 2006 pricing request. The PSCW considered these additional costs and approved an increase in electric rates of $222.0 million in January 2006. In addition, the PSCW approved an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million or 31.5% to be phased in over the two year period of 2006 and 2007. These rate increases became effective on January 26, 2006 and we anticipate will remain in effect through December 2007. The January 2006 order also addressed Wisconsin Electrics under and over collection of fuel costs in its electric rates. For 2006, the PSCW approved a plan for Wisconsin Electric to refund any over collection of fuel costs on an annual basis to ratepayers and the band for under collection of fuel costs will be 2%. Beginning in 2007, the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric will operate under a fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction with a plus or minus 2% band. In June 2005, we filed with the PSCW a natural gas price increase request of $27.4 million for Wisconsin Electric. The increase was requested to address the higher costs associated with adding and maintaining gas mains and infrastructure to maintain safety and reliability and certain costs related to gas in storage. In January 2006, we received approval from the PSCW for a rate increase of $21.4 million or 2.9% for Wisconsin Electric. This rate increase became effective on January 26, 2006 and we anticipate will remain in effect through December 2007. The January 2006 order approved a return on equity for Wisconsin Electric operations of 11.2%. In 2005, Wisconsin Electrics approved return on equity was 12.2%. 60 The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of recent rate changes. Service Wisconsin Electric Incremental Annualized Revenue Increase Percent Change in Rates Effective Date (Millions) (%) Retail electric, Wisconsin $222.0 10.6% January 26, 2006 Retail gas, Wisconsin $21.4 2.9% January 26, 2006 Retail steam, Wisconsin (a) $7.8 31.5% January 26, 2006 Fuel electric, Michigan $2.7 5.9% January 1, 2006 Fuel electric, Wisconsin (b) $7.7 0.3% November 24, 2005 Fuel electric, Michigan $2.5 5.8% November 1, 2005 Retail electric, Wisconsin $59.7 3.1% May 19, 2005 Retail steam, Wisconsin $0.5 3.6% May 19, 2005 Fuel electric, Wisconsin (b) $114.9 5.9% March 18, 2005 Fuel electric, Michigan $3.4 8.0% January 1, 2005 Fuel electric, Michigan $1.3 3.1% October 1, 2004 Retail steam, Wisconsin $0.5 3.4% May 5, 2004 Retail electric, Wisconsin (c) $59.0 3.3% May 5, 2004 Fuel electric, Michigan $3.3 7.6% January 1, 2004 Fuel electric, Wisconsin (d) $6.1 0.3% October 2, 2003 Fuel electric, Wisconsin (d) $55.1 3.3% March 14, 2003 Fuel electric, Michigan $0.9 2.0% January 1, 2003 (a) In January 2006, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million over the two year period of 2006 and 2007. (b) In November 2005, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $7.7 million of additional fuel costs. In March 2005, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $114.9 million that was effective until the November 2005 final order was issued by the PSCW. The final November 2005 order for $122.6 million superseded the March 2005 interim order. (c) In May 2004, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing an increase in electric rates for costs associated with the PWGS under construction and increased costs associated with low income energy assistance. (d) In October 2003, the PSCW issued a final order authorizing a fuel surcharge for $6.1 million of additional fuel costs. In March 2003, the PSCW issued an interim order authorizing a surcharge for $55.1 million of additional fuel costs on an annualized basis subject to true up. Wisconsin Gas: As discussed above, Wisconsin Gas was also under the five year rate restriction period which ended December 31, 2005. In June 2005, we filed with the PSCW a natural gas price increase request, as well as all materials for the PSCW and other parties to commence the rate review required by the March 2000 order. We requested a rate increase of $53.2 million to address the higher costs associated with adding and maintaining gas mains and infrastructure to maintain safety and reliability and certain costs related to gas in storage. In January 2006, we received approval from the PSCW for a rate increase of $38.7 million or 3.7% for Wisconsin Gas. This rate increase became effective on January 26, 2006 and we anticipate will remain in effect through December 2007. The January 2006 order approved a return on equity for Wisconsin Gas operations of 11.2%. In 2005, Wisconsin Gas had an approved return on equity of 11.8%. In March 2004, the PSCW approved an annual rate increase of $25.9 million related to increased costs associated with the construction of the Ixonia lateral and for increased costs associated with low income energy assistance. 61 Limited Rate Adjustment Requests 2005 Revenue Deficiencies: In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric and steam rates for anticipated 2005 revenue deficiencies associated with (1) costs for the new PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion being constructed as part of our Power the Future strategy, (2) costs associated with our energy efficiency procurement plan and (3) costs associated with making changes to our steam utility systems as part of the reconstruction of the Marquette Interchange highway project in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The filing identified anticipated revenue deficiencies in 2005 attributable to Wisconsin in the amount of $84.8 million (4.5%) for the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric and $0.5 million (3.6%) for Wisconsin Electrics steam operations. In January 2005, as a result of the litigation involving our Oak Creek expansion, we amended this filing to reduce the total revenue request to $52.4 milli on. In May 2005, the PSCW issued its final written order implementing an annualized increase in electric rates of $59.7 million (3.1%) and an increase of $0.5 million (3.6%) in steam rates. 2005 Fuel Recovery Filing: In February 2005, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric rates in the amount of $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power as a result of customer growth and the increase in the reliance upon natural gas as a fuel source. We received approval for the increase in fuel recoveries on an interim basis in March 2005. In November 2005, we received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $7.7 million in rate increases, for a total increase of $122.6 million (6.2%). In December 2005, two parties filed suit against the PSCW in Dane County Circuit Court challenging the PSCWs decision to allow fuel cost recovery, while allowing us to keep the savings that resulted from the WICOR acquisition. As a condition of the PSCW approval of the WICOR acquisition, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas were restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a f ive year period ending December 31, 2005, with certain limited exceptions, but we were allowed to keep the savings generated from the merger. We believe the challenge of the PSCWs decision is without merit, however the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Other Utility Rate Matters Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested of its transmission assets with the formation of the ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of the ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within the ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed the deferral of transmission costs in excess of amounts imbedded in rates. We are allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2005, we have deferred $169.4 million of unrecovered transmission costs. In January 2006, our rates were increased by approximately $67.5 million annually to recover transmission costs that were not currently in rates. We wi ll continue to accrue carrying costs on the unrecovered balances. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: Within the State of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Imbedded within its base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules, no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a band of the costs imbedded in current rates for the twelve month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs are expected to fall outside of the band, and actual interim costs fall outside of established ranges, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. For 2006, the upper band is 2% and we will refund any over recovered annual fuel costs. For 2007, the band is plus or minus 2%. Edison Sault and our Wisconsin Electric operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs on a dollar for dollar basis. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under a gas cost recovery mechanism (GCRM) as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. There is an incentive mechanism under the GCRM which allows for increased revenues if we acquire gas lower than 62 benchmarks approved by the PSCW. During 2005, no additional revenues were earned under the incentive portion of the GCRM and $0.2 million and $9.0 million of additional revenues were earned in 2004 and 2003 under the GCRM. Bad Debt Costs: Prior to October 2002, Wisconsin Gas expensed amounts included in rates for bad debt expense. If actual bad debt costs exceeded amounts allowed in rates, these amounts were deferred as a regulatory asset. Effective October 2002, the PSCW issued an order which eliminated escrow accounting for bad debts. The escrow amount accumulated at September 30, 2002 of approximately $6.9 million is being collected in rates. In 2003 and 2004, due to a combination of unusually high natural gas prices, a soft economy within our utility service territories, and limited governmental assistance available to low income customers, we saw a significant increase in residential uncollectible accounts receivable. Because of this, we requested and received letters from the PSCW which allowed Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas to defer the costs of residential bad debts to the extent that the costs exceeded the amounts allowed in rates. As a result of these letters from the PSCW, we deferred approximately $21.2 million and $15.6 million in 2004 and 2003 related to bad debt costs. In January 2006, the PSCW issued an order approving the amortization over the next five years of the bad debts deferred in 2004 and 2003 for Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric gas operations. The bad debts deferred in 2004 and 2003 related to electric operations will be considered for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW. In December 2004, we filed with the PSCW a request to implement a pilot program, which, among other things, is designed to better match our collection efforts with the ability of low income customers to pay their bills. Included in this filing was a request to implement escrow accounting for all residential bad debt costs. In February 2005, the PSCW approved our pilot program and our request for the use of escrow accounting. The final decision was received in March 2005. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceed amounts allowed in rates. As a result of this approval from the PSCW, we escrowed approximately $17.2 million in 2005 related to bad debt costs. These amounts were not addressed in the January 2006 rate order, and will therefore be considered for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW. We will continue following the escrow m ethod of accounting for bad debts as approved in the March 2005 PSCW order. Environmental Trust Financing: In March 2004, the Governor of Wisconsin signed into law a measure that gives utilities the ability to securitize the portion of customer bills that recovers the cost of certain investments intended to improve the environment. The measure would result in a lower cost to customers when compared to traditional financing and ratemaking. In June 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW that sought authority to issue up to $500 million of environmental trust bonds pursuant to this legislation. In October 2004, the PSCW approved an order authorizing Wisconsin Electric to issue environmental trust bonds to finance the recovery of $425 million of environmental control costs plus up front financing costs. The proposed terms of the bonds are subject to further PSCW approval prior to issuance. We will continue to evaluate the potential issuance of environmental trust bonds. MISO Midwest Market: In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW for certain incremental costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation on April 1, 2005 of the MISO Midwest Market. We received approval for this accounting treatment in March 2005. Additionally, in March 2005 we submitted a joint proposal to the PSCW with other utilities requesting escrow accounting treatment for the MISO Midwest Market costs until each utilitys first rate case following April 1, 2008. The purpose of the March 2005 request for escrow accounting was to provide clarification on costs not included in the March 2005 approval for deferral accounting treatment. We anticipate receiving a decision on this request in 2006. For additional information see Industry Restructuring and Competition Electric Transmission and Energy Markets MISO below. Nuclear Refueling Outages 2005: In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting treatment for non fuel operations and maintenance expenses related to the second nuclear refueling outage that occurred in the fall of 2005. In March 2005, the PSCW denied this request. In May 2005, we requested and we received approval from the PSCW to defer replacement power costs incurred after May 30, 2005 due to the longer than expected outage at Point Beach Unit 2. We deferred $22.1 million of incremental purchased power costs related to the extended 63 outage. We expect to recover these deferred costs in future rates, subject to PSCW audit and approval. For additional information see Nuclear Operations below. Reduced Coal Deliveries: In August 2005, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to defer incremental fuel costs associated with reduced coal deliveries. Through December 31, 2005, we deferred approximately $26.0 million of incremental fuel costs and we expect to recover these costs in future rates, subject to review and approval of the PSCW. We do not anticipate deferring additional costs under this order in 2006. For further information regarding rates see Managements Discussion and Analysis Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks Commodity Price Risk. Depreciation Rates: In January 2005, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed a joint application with the PSCW for certification of depreciation rates for specific classes of utility plant assets. In November 2005, we received notice from the PSCW that the proposed estimated lives, net salvage values and depreciation rates were approved and became effective January 1, 2006. We expect the new depreciation rates to reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $17 million due to the lengthening of nuclear plant lives which will reduce annual expense. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy. Wisconsin Electric had adequate capacity to meet all of its firm electric load obligations during 2005. All of Wisconsin Electrics generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required, nor was there the need to interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs in exchange for discounted rates. In May 2003, a flood at a hydroelectric dam owned by another utility forced a complete shutdown of the 618 megawatt Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan, which resulted in the curtailment of non firm service to some customers, as well as brief interruptions to firm service. Deliveries were also curtailed on several occasions to certain special contract customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan because of transmission constraints in the area including an incident in December 2003. During the December 2003 incident, flow was interrupted on the three main electric transmission lines owned by ATC connecting Wisconsin to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This incident also resulted in short outages to some firm customers. Wisconsin Electric expects to have adequate capacity to meet all of its firm load obligations during 2006. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require Wisconsin Electric to call upon load management procedures during 2006 as it has in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face potentially significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), small particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash, (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites, (4) disposal of used nuclear fuel, and (5) the eventual decommissioning of nuclear power plants. 64 We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including (1) substituting new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of our Power the Future strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules, (4) entering into agreements with the WDNR and EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% and mercury by 50% by 2013 from Wisconsin Electrics coal fired power plants in Wisconsin and Michigan, (5) recycling of ash from coal fired generating units, and (6) the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA consent decree is estimated to be approximately $600 million over the 10 years ending 2013. Through December 31, 2005, we have spent approximately $216.5 m illion associated with implementing the EPA agreement. There could be additional costs of compliance with the EPA consent decree should Wisconsin Electric elect to control rather than retire Units 5 and 6 at the Oak Creek Power Plant. We believe this additional cost may add approximately $150 million to $350 million to the estimate. For further information concerning the consent decree, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. For further information concerning disposal of used nuclear fuel and nuclear power plant decommissioning, see Nuclear Operations below and Note I Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, respectively. National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In 2000 and 2001, Michigan and Wisconsin finalized state rules implementing phased emission reductions required to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for 1 hour ozone. In 2004, the EPA began implementing NAAQS for 8 hour ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ). The states are currently developing rules to implement the new standards. Although specific emission control requirements are not yet defined, Wisconsin Electric believes that the revised standards will likely require significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from coal fired generating facilities. Wisconsin Electric expects that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8 hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages from 2007 through 2010. Reductions associated with the fine particulate matter standards are expected to be implemented in stages after the year 2010 and exten ding to the year 2017. Wisconsin Electric is currently unable to predict the impact that the revised air quality standards might have on the operations of our existing coal fired generating facilities until the states develop rules and submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8 hour ozone and fine particulate matter NAAQS. 1 hour Ozone Standard: The 1 hour ozone nonattainment rules currently being implemented by the State of Wisconsin and the ozone transport rules implemented by the State of Michigan limit NOx emissions in phases over the 2003 2008 time period. Wisconsin Electric currently expects to incur total annual operation and maintenance costs of $2 3 million during the period 2004 through 2007 to comply with the Michigan and Wisconsin rules. In January 2000, the PSCW approved Wisconsin Electrics comprehensive plan to meet the rules, permitting recovery in rates of NOx emission reduction costs over an accelerated 10 year recovery period. 8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in Southeastern Wisconsin as nonattainment areas for the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. States are required to develop and submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. We expect that reductions needed to achieve compliance with the 8 hour ozone attainment standard will be implemented in stages from 2007 through 2010, and that some or all of these reductions will be accomplished through implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). See below for further information regarding CAIR. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NOx emission reductions requirements under the agreements with the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPAs 8 hour ozone NAAQS. However, the timing of the requirements may be impacted by requiring earlier installation of NOx controls at some units, depending on how the states implement the rules. PM2.5 Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated PM 2.5 nonattainment areas in the country. All counties in the State of Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. It is unknown at this time whether Wisconsin or Michigan will require additional emission reductions as part of state or regional implementation of the PM2.5 standard and what impact those requirements would have on operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities. 65 Clean Air Interstate Rule: The EPA issued the final CAIR regulation in March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8 hour ozone and PM 2.5 standards by addressing the regional transport of SO2 and NOx. CAIR requires NOx and SO2 emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28 state region within the eastern United States. Wisconsin and Michigan are affected states under CAIR. The phase 1 compliance deadline is January 1, 2009 for NOx and January 1, 2010 for SO2, and the phase 2 compliance deadline is January 1, 2015 for both NOx and SO2. Overall, the CAIR is expected to result in a 70% reduction in SO2 emissions and a 65% reduction in NOx emissions from 2002 emission levels. The states are required to develop and submit implementation plans by October 2006, and unt il those plans are in place, it is not possible to estimate the impact of the CAIR. Wisconsin Electric believes that compliance with the NOx and SO2 emission reductions requirements under the agreements with the WDNR and EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the CAIR rule. Clean Air Mercury Rule: The EPA issued the final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) in March 2005 following the agencys 2000 regulatory determination that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. CAMR limits mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants, and caps utility mercury emission in two phases, applicable in 2010 and 2018. The caps limit emissions at approximately 20% and ultimately 70% below todays utility mercury levels. The states are required to develop and submit implementation plans by November 2006. Until those plans are in place, it is not possible to estimate the final impact of the CAMR, but additional expenditures are anticipated in order to meet both phases of the federal rule. Because the technology is under development, it is difficult to estimate the cost. We believe the range of possible expenditures could be approximately $50 million to $200 million. The construction air permit issued for the Oak Creek expansion is not impacted by the new rule. The federal rule is being challenged by a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. Depending on the litigation, the timing for compliance may be affected. The WDNR independently developed mercury emission control rules that affect electric utilities in Wisconsin and issued state only mercury control rules in October 2004. The rules explicitly recognize an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal program. The rules state that the WDNR must adopt state rule changes within 18 months of publication of any federal rules. State rules are to be changed to be consistent with, and no more restrictive than, any federal rules. We anticipate that the state rules will be revised or replaced, consistent with the CAMR requirements, and that no additional emission control investments will be needed as a result of the state only rules. Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address regional haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. Under CAVR, states are required to identify certain industrial facilities and power plants that affect visibility in the nations 156 Class I protected areas. States then determine the types of emission controls that those facilities must use to control their emissions. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include particulate matter or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. States must submit plans to implement CAVR to the EPA by December 2007. The reductions associated with the state plans are scheduled to begin to take effect in 2014 with full implementation before 2018. Wisconsin Electric is currently unable to predict the impact that CAVR might have on the operations of our existing coal fired generating facilities until the states develop rules and submit implementation plans to the EPA. Clean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. This law dates back to 1972; however, prior to September 2004, there have not been federal rules that define precisely how states and EPA regions would determine that an existing intake meets BTA requirements. This rule establishes, for the first time, national performance standards and compliance alternatives for existing facilities that are designed to minimize the potential adverse environmental impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the rule for Wisconsin Electrics Oak Creek Power Plant, We Powers Oak Creek expansion and PWGS have been included in project costs. Studies to determine costs, if any, that may be associated with Wisconsin Electr ics other existing facilities are expected to take place over the next three years. 66 Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: Wisconsin Electric aggressively seeks environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for its combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. EPA Proposed Consent Decree: Wisconsin Electric entered into a proposed consent decree with the EPA to address all matters relating to information requests received from the EPA pursuant to Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Greenhouse Gases: There have been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide (CO2), including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Kyoto, Japan. While the Bush Administration has not supported U.S. ratification of the Kyoto Protocol or other legislation requiring reductions in CO2, in 2002, the Bush Administration announced a goal of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. economy by 18% by 2012. In addition, in December 2004, the U.S. Department of Energy announced the Climate VISION program in furtherance of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to take voluntary measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases; however, the impact of any future legislation that would require reductions in greenhouse gases cannot be assessed at this time. Wisconsin Electric continues to support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. These strategies include emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. Wisconsin Electric also supports a voluntary approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Wisconsin Electric emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions planned or underway as part of the Power the Future plan, including: Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas combined cycle units. Adding coal fired units using state of the art technology as part of the Oak Creek expansion. Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation. Maintaining and increasing non emitting generation by potentially adding approximately 130 to 200 megawatts of wind capacity and increasing customer participation in the Energy for Tomorow &reg; renewable energy program. Successful renewal of the Point Beach Nuclear units operating licenses. LEGAL MATTERS Presque Isle Flood: During the second quarter of 2003, our Presque Isle Power Plant was temporarily shut down due to the failure of a hydroelectric reservoir dike which flooded Marquette, Michigan. We estimate that our fuel and purchased power costs increased by approximately $8 million due to the need for replacement power during the plant outage. These increased costs were included as part of the fuel surcharge request discussed above. In addition, we incurred approximately $13.5 million in damage to equipment and property. We have reached settlements with an insurance carrier and other third parties. Through litigation, we are continuing to pursue recovery against other third parties. Arbitration Proceedings: Our largest electric customer owns two mines that operate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The mines represent approximately 7% of our annual electric sales and less than 1% of our annual net income. The mines have special negotiated contracts that expire in December 2007. The contracts have price caps for approximately 80% of the energy sales. The mines are billed at rates reflecting incremental costs and amounts billed that exceed the price caps are refunded without interest in the year following the contract year. We do not recognize revenue on amounts billed that exceed the price caps. 67 The incremental power costs in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are now determined by MISO. In April 2005, we began to bill the mines the incremental power costs as quantified by the MISO Midwest Market. The mines have notified us that they are disputing these billings and they have placed the disputed amounts in escrow. In September 2005, the mines notified us that they filed for formal arbitration related to the contracts. We have notified the mines that we believe that they have failed to comply with certain notification provisions related to annual production as specified within the contracts. As of December 31, 2005, the mines have placed $70.6 million in escrow. As noted above, the amounts that have been placed in escrow primarily relate to amounts that would have been refunded without interest in the year following the contract year. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the formal arbitration process, but we believe that it will not have a material impact on ou r financial condition or results of operations. Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services. In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage, and more recently, ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. In 2003, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeals affirmance of a jury verdict against Wisconsin Electric, awarding $1.2 million to the plaintiffs in a stray voltage lawsuit. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW level of concern. Even though the claims which have been made against Wisconsin Electric with respect to stray voltage and ground currents are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial statements, we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric owns two 518 megawatt electric generating units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. The Plant is operated by Nuclear Management Company, LLC (NMC), a joint venture of the Company and affiliates of other unaffiliated utilities. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Point Beach provided approximately 20% of Wisconsin Electrics net electric energy supply. Each Unit at the Plant has a scheduled refueling outage approximately every 18 months. In 2005, Unit 2 had a scheduled refueling outage over the second and third quarters and Unit 1 had a scheduled refueling outage over the third and fourth quarters. During the 2005 scheduled refueling outages we replaced the reactor vessel heads at each Unit. As expected, this work, along with other planned maintenance, resulted in longer than normal outages. During scheduled refueling outages, we incur significant operations and maintenance costs for work performed during the outages and we incur costs associated with replacement power. See Results of Operations for further discussion regarding the costs associated with nuclear outages. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Unit 2 is scheduled to have a refueling outage. In 2004, Unit 1 had a scheduled refueling outage in the second quarter and in 2003, Unit 2 had a scheduled refueling outage over the third and fourth quarters. In February 2004, NMC and Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew the operating license for both Units for an additional 20 years. The NRC approved the license renewal request in December 2005. The new operating licenses expire in October 2030 for Unit 1 and March 2033 for Unit 2. In February 2006, we announced that we are undertaking a formal review this year regarding our options for the ownership and operation of Point Beach. At December 31, 2005, NMC operated seven nuclear generating units, 68 down from eight units at December 31, 2004. As of February 2006, that number has decreased to six units and another owner has announced the planned sale of their unit, which would further reduce the size of the fleet operated by NMC. Given these changes, we believe it is prudent to evaluate a range of options for Point Beach. The options that we are planning to evaluate include: (1) continued operation by NMC, (2) continued operation by a third party operator other than NMC, (3) a return to in house operation of the plant by Wisconsin Electric and (4) a sale of the Point Beach facility. We plan to complete this formal review in the fourth quarter of 2006. In July 2000, our senior management authorized the commencement of initial design work for the power uprate of both Units at Point Beach. Subject to approval by the PSCW, the project could add approximately 90 megawatts of electrical output to Point Beach. In February 2003, Point Beach completed an equipment upgrade which resulted in a capacity increase of 7 megawatts per generating Unit. We are currently evaluating the timing for implementation of the power uprate project. During 2002 and 2003, the NRC issued Final Significance Determination letters for two red (high safety significance) inspection findings regarding problems identified by Point Beach with the performance of the auxiliary feedwater system recirculation lines. During 2003, the NRC conducted a three phase supplemental inspection of Point Beach in accordance with NRC Inspection Procedure 95003 to review corrective actions for the findings as well as the effectiveness of the corrective action, emergency preparedness and engineering programs. The inspection results were presented at a public meeting in December 2003, and documented in a February 2004 NRC letter to NMC. The NRC determined that the plant is being operated in a manner that ensures public safety but also identified several performance issues in the areas of problem identification and resolution, emergency preparedness, electrical design basis calculation control and engineering operations communication. NMC responded to the supplemental inspection in February 2004 with specific commitments to address the NRC concerns, including revision of the Point Beach Excellence Plan. We were assessed a fine of $60,000 related to issues identified with our emergency preparedness. NRC reviewed the adequacy of the revised Excellence Plan and its implementation, and NMC received a confirmatory action letter in April 2004. NRC will continue to provide increased oversight at Point Beach. As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, NRC and the industry have been strengthening security at nuclear power plants. Security at Point Beach remains at a high level, with limited access to the site continuing. Point Beach has responded to NRCs February 2002 Order for interim safeguards and security compensatory measures. Point Beach has also responded to NRC orders regarding security of independent spent fuel storage installations, design basis threat and security officer training and work hours. Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: Wisconsin Electric is authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed by the NRC in December 2005. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the United States Department of Energy takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the Department of Energy failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric has paid a total of $207.4 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of the Plant. On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the Department of Energys failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the Department of Energy in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court has subsequently scheduled the trial for March 2007. Wisconsin Electric has incurred substantial damages to date and damages continue to accrue. We are 69 seeking recovery of our damages in this lawsuit and we expect that any recoveries would be considered in setting future rates. In July 2002, the President signed a resolution which allowed the United States Department of Energy to begin preparation of the application to the NRC for a license to design and build a spent fuel repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The Department of Energy has indicated that it does not expect a permanent used fuel repository to be available any earlier than 2010. It is not possible, at this time, to predict with certainty when the Department of Energy will actually begin accepting used nuclear fuel. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry Across the United States, electric industry restructuring progress remains slow as it has been subsequent to the California price and supply problems in early 2001. The FERC continues to support large regional transmission organizations (RTOs), which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented a bid based market, the MISO Midwest Market, including the use of locational marginal pricing (LMP) to value electric transmission congestion. The MISO Midwest Market commenced operation on April 1, 2005. The timeline for restructuring and retail access continues to be stretched out, and it is uncertain when retail access will happen in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act, which impacts the electric utility industry. (See Other Matters below for additional information on the Energy Policy Act). In addition, major issues in industry restructuring, implementation of RTO markets and market power mitigation received substantial attention in 2005. We continue to focus on infrastructure issues through our Power the Future growth strategy. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, Wisconsin is proceeding with restructuring of the electric utility industry at a much slower pace than many other states in the United States. Instead, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the State of Wisconsin such as: Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; and Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: Electric utility revenues are regulated by the MPSC. In June 2000, the Governor of Michigan signed the "Customer Choice and Electric Reliability Act" into law empowering the MPSC to implement electric retail access in Michigan. The new law provides that as of January 1, 2002, all Michigan retail customers of investor owned utilities have the ability to choose their electric power producer. The Michigan Retail Access law was characterized by the Michigan Governor as "Choice for those who want it and protection for those who need it." As of January 1, 2002, Michigan retail customers of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. 70 Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in the companies service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of two general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan, reflecting the small market area, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a lack of interest in general in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Restructuring in Illinois: In 1999, the State of Illinois passed legislation that introduced retail electric choice for large customers and introduced choice for all retail customers in May 2002. This legislation has not had, and is not expected to have a material impact on Wisconsin Electrics business. Wisconsin Electric had one wholesale customer in Illinois, the City of Geneva, whose contract expired on December 31, 2005. Electric Transmission and Energy Markets American Transmission Company: Effective January 1, 2001, we transferred all of the electric utility transmission assets of Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault to ATC in exchange for ownership interests in this new company. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission owning member of MISO. As of February 1, 2002, operational control of ATCs transmission system was transferred to MISO, and Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault became non transmission owning members and customers of MISO. MISO: In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented a bid based energy market, the MISO Midwest Market, which commenced operations on April 1, 2005. As part of this energy market, the MISO developed a market based platform for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through the use of Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). FTRs are allocated to market participants by MISO. The first allocation of FTRs was completed for the period of April 1, 2005 through August 31, 2005. The FTR allocation process was then performed again for the period from September 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006. To date, our unhedged congestion charges have not been material. MISO deferred the costs to develop and start up its energy market (new software systems and personnel). Now that the market is operational, the development and start up costs are charged to MISO market participants, including Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault. To mitigate the risks of this new bid based energy market, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW in January 2005 for certain incremental costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation of the MISO Midwest Market. Our request excluded LMP energy costs because these costs are subject to recovery under the Wisconsin Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure. In March 2005, the PSCW accepted our request. We submitted another joint proposal with other utilities in March 2005, requesting escrow accounting treatment for MISO Midwest Market costs until each utilitys first rate case following April 1, 2008. The purpose of the March 2005 request for escrow accounting was to provide clarification on costs not included in the March 2005 approval for deferral accounting treatment. For further information on the accounting for MISO transactions see Critical Accounting Estimates below. In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load serving entities (LSEs) located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner in proportion to the load served by the LSE versus the total load of the service territory. This "license plate" rate design is scheduled to be replaced after a six year phase in of rates in MISO on or around February 1, 2008. In addition, FERC ordered a seams elimination charge to be paid by MISO LSEs from December 1, 2004 until March 31, 2006, to compensate transmission owners for the loss of revenues resulting from the joining of an RTO and or FERCs elimination of through and out transmission charges between the MISO and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. The FERC ordered that certain existing transmission transactions continue to pay for through and out service from December 1, 2004 until March 31, 2006. The details of the seams elimination charge and the quantification of the existing transaction charge are the subject of a hearing process in itiated by FERC in a February 2005 order. A decision from the hearing process is expected in the second half of 2006. In January 2006, Wisconsin Electric along with certain other parties to the proceeding, submitted an offer of settlement to the presiding administrative law judge that, if approved, will resolve all issues set for hearing that impact Wisconsin Electric with regard to the continued payment of through and out transmission charges as well as the seams elimination charge. To date, neither the administrative law judge nor the FERC has addressed the merits 71 of the settlement. If the settlement offer is approved by the FERC as submitted, Wisconsin Electric would receive a small refund of transmission charges in excess of the seams elimination charge. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. OTHER MATTERS In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act includes tax subsidies for electric utilities and the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA 1935). The Energy Policy Act also amends federal energy laws and provides the FERC with new oversight responsibilities for the electric utility industry. Implementation of the Energy Policy Act requires the development of regulations by federal agencies, including the FERC. As noted above, the Energy Policy Act and corresponding rules require us to seek FERC authorization to allow Wisconsin Electric to lease from We Power the three Power the Future units that are currently being constructed by We Power. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005), transferring jurisdiction over holding companies from the SEC to the FERC. Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric will be requir ed to notify the FERC of their status as holding companies and to seek from FERC the exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. As federal agencies continue to develop new rules to implement the Energy Policy Act, we expect additional impacts on Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries in the future. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which amended SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107) regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of share based payment for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS 123R to January 1, 2006. This statement requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated income statement. We adopted SFAS 123R and SAB 107 effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. See Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of FASB Statement 143. We adopted FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005. For further information see Note F Asset Retirement Obligations. We adopted FASB Staff Position FIN 46R 5, Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation 46 (revised December 2003), in the second quarter of 2005. This statement requires that holdings of implicit variable interests are evaluated when applying Interpretation 46R. See Note G Variable Interest Entities for further information. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 20 and SFAS 3. This statement requires a retrospective application of direct changes in accounting principles to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. In addition, SFAS 154 instructs that a change in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets must be recorded as a change in accounting 72 estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. We adopted SFAS 154, effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 154 has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, as we have not had a change in accounting principle that we were required to implement to date in 2006. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Developing competitive pressures in the utility industry may result in future utility prices which are based upon factors other than the traditional original cost of investment. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1,025.6 million in regulatory assets and $1,373.2 million in regulatory liabilities. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefits: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. 73 Pension Plan Actuarial Assumption (a) Impact on Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $7.1 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $4.9 (a) The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction. In addition to pension plans, we maintain other post retirement benefit plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for these plans in accordance with SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future post retirement benefit costs. Other post retirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the post retirement benef it obligation and post retirement costs. Our other post retirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes. The following chart reflects other post retirement benefit plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. Other Post retirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumption (a) Impact on Reported Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.1 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate ($1.4) 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $0.9 (a) The inverse of the change in the actuarial assumption may be expected to have an approximately similar impact in the opposite direction. Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2005 of $3,793.0 million included accrued utility revenues of $262.9 million at December 31 , 2005. Asset Retirement Obligations: We account for legal liabilities for asset retirements at fair value in the period in which they are incurred according to the provisions of SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143) and Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an Interpretation of SFAS 143. SFAS 143 applies primarily to decommissioning costs for our utility energy segments Point Beach Nuclear Plant. Using a discounted future cash flow methodology, our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation was 74 approximately $309.8 million at December 31, 2005. As it relates to our operations, FIN 47 applies primarily to asbestos removal costs. At December 31, 2005, we recorded an obligation of $37.4 million related to asbestos. Calculation of the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation is based upon projected decommissioning costs calculated by an independent decommissioning consulting firm, as well as several significant assumptions including the timing of future cash flows, future inflation rates and the discount rate applied to future cash flows. Assuming the following changes in key assumptions and holding all other assumptions constant, we estimate that our nuclear asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2005 would have changed by the following amounts: Change in Assumption Change in Liability (Millions of Dollars) 1% increase in inflation rate $101.1 1% decrease in inflation rate ($76.2) We were unable to identify a viable market for or third party who would be willing to assume this liability. Accordingly, we have used a market risk premium of zero when measuring our nuclear asset retirement obligation. We estimate that for each 1% increment that would be included as a market risk premium, our nuclear asset retirement obligation would increase by approximately $3.1 million. For additional information concerning SFAS 143 and our estimated nuclear asset retirement obligation, see Note F Asset Retirement Obligations and Note I Nuclear Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance: We record deferred tax asset valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $11.8 million of valuation allowances that relate to state net operating loss carryforwards (state NOLs) of various non utility subsidiaries. These NOLs begin to expire in 2008 and it is not likely that we will be able to utilize them. During 2005, we reduced our valuation allowances by $16.3 million as we were able to conclude that it was likely that we would be able to realize certain state NOLs recorded at the Parent company. This conclusion was based on the favorable decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in June 2005 that allowed the construction of the Oak Creek expansion as part of our Power the Future plan. The Power the Future generating units will be owned by our subsidiaries organized as limited liability companies (LLCs). Once the plants become operational, taxable income or loss of the LLCs will flow through to and be reported in the separate state income tax return of the Parent. As a result, the Parent no longer expects to generate large state taxable losses if all plants are in service. During 2005, the first of the four generating units was put into service. The determination of future state taxable income of the Parent is a significant estimate. Factors affecting the estimate include the amounts spent and timing for construction of the Power the Future generating units, the amount of debt and interest expense at the Parent and the consideration of available tax planning strategies. If we would conclude in a future period that it was more likely than not that some or all of the remaining state NOLs would be realized before expiration, GAAP would require that we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported as an increase or decrease in income. MISO Bid Based Energy Market: Effective April 1, 2005, MISO implemented the MISO Midwest Market, a bid based energy market. The market requires that all market participants submit day ahead and or real time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO then calculates the most efficient solution for all the bids and offers made into the market that day and establishes a LMP which reflects the market price for energy. As a participant in the new MISO Midwest Market, we are required to follow MISOs instructions when dispatching generating units to support MISOs responsibility for maintaining stability of the transmission system. To the extent the established LMP price for energy is not sufficient to recover the cost of running a generating unit dispatched at MISOs request, the tariff provides a mechanism for us to recover the deficiency (the "make whole payment"). Since the start of the MISO Midwest Market, MISO has significantly increased the amo unt of generation provided by our higher cost combustion turbines. We have recorded a receivable from MISO for the make whole payments 75 associated with this operation. A reserve has been established for a portion of these receivables that are currently in dispute. Additionally, the MISO Midwest Market subjects us to additional costs primarily associated with constraints in the transmission system. We expect to recover these deferred costs in future rates, subject to PSCW audit and approval. MISO settles each Operating Day a minimum of four times. A settlement statement is issued at 7, 14, 55 and 105 days after each Operating Day. In addition, since the market start, MISO has employed a non standard settlement statement at 155 days after the Operating Day. MISO has also announced plans to issue a non standard statement at 365 days after the Operating Day for days April 1, 2005 through August 31, 2005. Each subsequent statement may contain billing adjustments which alter our obligation to MISO.
