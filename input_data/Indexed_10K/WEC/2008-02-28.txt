ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non utility energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of our subsidiaries. Our utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies", and Edison Sault, is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric. CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We seek to increase stockholder value by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is PTF. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsins growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental performance. Our PTF strategy, which is discussed further below, is having and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our utility and non utility energy segments. In July 2005, the first of four new electric generating units under our PTF strategy was placed into service. Construction on the remaining three units is underway with the second PWGS unit expected to be placed in service during the second quarter of 2008. Since 2000, we have been selling our non core assets to direct more attention to the utility business and to finance PTF while reducing our debt leverage. Sale of Point Beach: On September 28, 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the buyer purchased Point Beach, its nuclear fuel, associated inventories and assumed the obligation to decommission the plant. Wisconsin Electric retained approximately $506 million of the sales proceeds, which represents the net book value of the assets sold and certain transaction costs. In addition, Wisconsin Electric has deferred the net gain on the sale of approximately $418 million as a regulatory liability and has deposited those proceeds into a restricted cash account. In connection with the sale, Wisconsin Electric also transferred $390 million of decommissioning funds to the buyer. Wisconsin Electric then liquidated the balance of the decommissioning trust assets and retained approximately $552 million, which was also placed into the restricted cash account. We intend to use the cash in the restricted cash account and the interest earned on the balance, for the benefit of our customers and to pay certain taxes related to the liquidation of the qualified decommissioning trust. Our regulators are directing the manner in which these proceeds will benefit customers. For further information on the 2008 rate case, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we will be paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered. For additional information on the sale of Point Beach, see Nuclear Operations under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. Utility Energy Segment: Our utility energy segment strives to provide reasonably priced energy delivered at high levels of customer service and reliability. We expect our prices to be established by our regulatory bodies under traditional rate based, cost of service methodologies. We continue to gain efficiencies and improve the effectiveness 41 of our service deliveries through the combined support operations of our electric and gas businesses. We work to obtain a reliable, reasonably priced supply of electricity through plants that we operate and various long term supply contracts. Non Utility Energy Segment: Our primary focus in this segment is to improve the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease new generation assets under our PTF strategy. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, we filed a petition with the PSCW that would allow us to begin implementing our 10 year PTF strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. PTF is intended to meet a growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under PTF, we are (1) investing approximately $2.6 billion in 2,120 MW of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrading our existing electric generating facilities; and (3) investing in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. Subsequent to our February 2001 filing, the Wisconsin legislature amended several laws, making changes which were critical to the implementation of PTF. In October 2001, the PSCW issued a declaratory ruling finding, among other things, that it was prudent to proceed with PTF and for us to incur the associated pre certification expenses. However, individual expenses are subject to review by the PSCW in order to be recovered. In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin Electric will lease each new generating facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the investments in We Powers new facilities over the initial lease term. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. Wisconsin Electric expects that payments under the plant leases will be recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law. Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through We Powers construction of the PWGS units and the Oak Creek expansion. As of December 31, 2007, we: Received approval from the PSCW to build two 545 MW natural gas fired intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin (PWGS 1 and PWGS 2). PWGS 1 was placed into service in July 2005 and is fully operational. PWGS 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. Completed site preparation for PWGS 2 and procured all of the major components for PWGS 2. Construction is underway, and PWGS 2 is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2008. Received approval from the PSCW to build two 615 MW coal fired base load units (OC 1 and OC 2) adjacent to the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant in Oak Creek, Wisconsin (the Oak Creek expansion), with OC 1 expected to be in service in 2009 and OC 2 in 2010. The CPCN was granted contingent upon our obtaining the necessary environmental permits. We have received all permits necessary to commence construction. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site. Completed the planned sale of approximately a 17% ownership interest in the Oak Creek expansion to two co owners. Received approval from the PSCW for various leases between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. Through December 31, 2007, we have financed our PTF expenditures with internally generated cash, asset sales and debt financings. Future expenditures are expected to be financed with internally generated cash and debt financings. We currently do not plan to issue any new common equity as part of our PTF program. 42 Our primary risks under PTF are construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for both our Oak Creek expansion and PWGS 2; continuing legal challenges to permits obtained and changes in applicable laws or regulations; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the permitting agencies; the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner; obtaining the investment capital from outside sources necessary to implement the strategy; governmental actions; and events in the global economy. For further information concerning PTF capital requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. For additional information regarding risks associated with the PTF strategy, as well as the regulatory process and specific regulatory approvals, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Divestiture of Assets Our PTF strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily included non utility generation assets located outside of Wisconsin and a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio, as well as our manufacturing business. In addition, in 2001 we contributed our transmission assets to ATC and received cash proceeds of $119.8 million and an economic interest in ATC. Finally, in 2006 we concluded that it was in the best interests of customers and stockholders to sell Point Beach. In 2007, we sold Point Beach for approximately $924 million. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion from the divestiture of assets as follows: Proceeds from divestitures: 2000 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Point Beach $924.1 Manufacturing 857.0 Non Utility Energy 616.8 Real Estate 482.9 Transmission 119.8 Guardian 38.5 Other 95.7 Total $3,134.8 43 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $586.0 $532.8 $542.4 Non Utility Energy 47.4 43.1 19.5 Corporate and Other (4.9) (7.4) 1.0 Total Operating Income 628.5 568.5 562.9 Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliate 43.1 38.6 34.6 Other Income and Deductions, net 48.9 53.1 28.7 Interest Expense, net 167.6 172.7 173.4 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 552.9 487.5 452.8 Income Taxes 216.4 175.0 149.2 Income From Continuing Operations 336.5 312.5 303.6 Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (0.9) 3.9 5.1 Net Income $335.6 $316.4 $308.7 Diluted Earnings Per Share Continuing Operation $2.84 $2.64 $2.56 Discontinued Operations (0.01) 0.03 0.05 Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $2.83 $2.67 $2.61 An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results in 2007, 2006 and 2005 follow. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2007 vs. 2006: Our utility energy segment contributed $586.0 million of operating income during 2007 compared with $532.8 million of operating income during 2006. During 2007 we experienced more favorable weather which increased electric and gas sales. In addition, we experienced an increase in retail sales as a result of customer growth and we reached a settlement regarding a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines. These items were partially offset by an increase in fuel and purchased power expenses. 2006 vs. 2005: Our utility energy segment contributed $532.8 million of operating income during 2006 compared with $542.4 million of operating income during 2005. During 2006, we experienced mild weather, which reduced electric and gas sales. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses increased due to the timing of scheduled outages and maintenance projects at our coal units. However, these items were largely offset by improved recovery of fuel costs, only one scheduled refueling outage at Point Beach and increased gas margins. 44 The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Utility Energy Segment 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,705.7 $2,529.4 $2,349.7 Gas 1,481.2 1,419.9 1,417.5 Other 37.9 29.7 25.8 Total Operating Revenues 4,224.8 3,979.0 3,793.0 Fuel and Purchased Power 1,000.6 806.2 780.8 Cost of Gas Sold 1,052.7 1,018.3 1,047.3 Gross Margin 2,171.5 2,154.5 1,964.9 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 1,174.2 1,211.1 1,010.4 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 315.2 314.0 324.1 Property and Revenue Taxes 102.6 96.6 88.0 Amortization of Gain (6.5) Operating Income $586.0 $532.8 $542.4 During September 2007, we completed the sale of Point Beach. In connection with the sale, a power purchase agreement with an affiliate of FPL became effective to purchase all of the energy produced by Point Beach. As a result of the sale and the power purchase agreement, we expect future income statements to look different than historical income statements. Prospectively, we expect to see significantly higher purchased power expense because we will be purchasing energy from Point Beach. We also expect to see a reduction of other operation and maintenance costs, as well as lower depreciation, decommissioning and amortization costs because we no longer own Point Beach. Under the power purchase agreement, we also expect to see higher costs for purchased power in the summer months and lower amounts in the non summer months. Finally, we expect our future income statements to reflect the regulatory impact of the amortization of the gain resulting from the sale of Point Beach. 45 Electric Utility Gross Margin The following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2007 with similar information for 2006 and 2005, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh Sales Electric Utility Operations 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $929.6 $883.2 $827.6 8,586.6 8,322.7 8,562.7 Small Commercial/Industrial 861.7 814.8 746.1 9,430.3 9,142.2 9,192.7 Large Commercial/Industrial 676.9 647.5 602.4 11,245.6 11,173.1 11,687.5 Other Retail 19.7 19.3 17.9 168.7 169.9 171.7 Total Retail Sales 2,487.9 2,364.8 2,194.0 29,431.2 28,807.9 29,614.6 Wholesale Other 95.1 78.0 94.7 2,178.5 2,057.6 2,541.9 Resale Utilities 81.6 51.2 21.3 1,434.5 1,025.7 313.7 Other Operating Revenues 41.1 35.4 39.7 Total $2,705.7 $2,529.4 $2,349.7 33,044.2 31,891.2 32,470.2 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 570.1 487.9 432.7 Purchased Power 419.7 309.8 340.3 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 989.8 797.7 773.0 Total Electric Gross Margin $1,715.9 $1,731.7 $1,576.7 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,627 Normal) 6,508 6,043 6,628 Cooling (722 Normal) 800 723 949 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. Electric Utility Revenues and Sales 2007 vs. 2006: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $176.3 million, or 7.0%, when compared to 2006. The biggest drivers of the increase in revenues relate to the recognition of revenues attributable to fuel and purchased power of approximately $37.4 million and increased revenues related to Resale Utilities of approximately $30.4 million. Our policy for electric fuel revenues is to not recognize revenue for any currently billable amounts if it is probable that we will refund those amounts to customers. In 2006, we experienced lower than expected fuel and purchased power costs, and we established $37.4 million of reserves to reflect amounts that were refunded to customers. No such reserves were established in 2007 as we experienced higher fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in Resale Utilities reflects our ability to sell electricity into the MISO and PJM markets due to the increased availability of our baseload plants. In addition, we estimate that $27.1 million of the increase in operating revenues relates to pricing increases. This increase primarily reflects rate increases received in late January 2006 that were in effect for the entire twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and a wholesale rate increase effective May 2007. We also estimate that $28.9 million of the increase was due to more favorable weather and $22.8 million relates to sales growth in residential and commercial sales. Finally, approximately $9.0 million of the increase relates to the settlement in the second quarter of 2007 of a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines. 46 Our retail electric sales volume grew by approximately 2.2%. The increase in retail sales was driven by growth in residential and commercial sales and more favorable weather in 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. In 2007, heating degree days increased by approximately 7.7% compared to 2006, and cooling degree days increased by approximately 10.7%. Our electric utility operating revenues are expected to increase in 2008 primarily due to the implementation of the January 2008 Wisconsin retail pricing increase. However, as the primary driver for the pricing increase is increased costs, we do not expect this pricing increase to cause a material increase in earnings. For more information on the pricing increases and the fuel cost adjustment clause, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 2006 vs. 2005: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $179.7 million, or 7.6%, when compared to 2005. Revenues in 2006 were $213.3 million higher than 2005 due to pricing increases that we received in January 2006 and during 2005. The most significant pricing increases authorized by the PSCW related to the recovery of higher fuel costs, costs associated with the new plants under our PTF strategy and increased transmission costs. Our electric sales volumes decreased by 1.8% in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to mild weather and lower commercial and industrial sales, offset by an increase in sales for resale. Residential sales volumes decreased 2.8% due largely to weather. In 2006, heating degree days decreased approximately 8.8% compared to 2005, and cooling degree days decreased approximately 23.8%. We estimate that the weather had an unfavorable impact on operating revenues of approximately $46.5 million when compared to the prior year. Total sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers decreased 2.7% between the comparative periods. Sales volumes to commercial/industrial customers, excluding our two largest customers, decreased 1.4%. Sales volumes in the wholesale class decreased approximately 19% compared to the prior year due, in part, to the expiration of a wholesale contract on December 31, 2005. The increase in sales volumes to other utilities is attributed to the availability of PWGS 1 for all of 2006, which provided additional generation capacity. PWGS 1 was not operational until the third quarter of 2005. Under the Wisconsin Fuel rules, sales to other utilities reduce fuel costs charged to customers. Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 2007 vs. 2006: Our fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $192.1 million, or approximately 24.1%, when compared to 2006. Our total electric sales volume increased by approximately 3.6%, when compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. However, our average fuel and purchased power costs increased by $4.86 per MWh, or approximately 20.6%. The largest factors for the higher cost per MWh are the power purchase agreement entered into in connection with the sale of Point Beach, which increased costs by approximately $47.0 million, increased coal and transportation costs, increased market prices for purchased energy and an increase in production of gas fired generation used for opportunity sales. We expect that electric fuel and purchased power expenses in 2008 will be higher than 2007 because of the full year impact of the Point Beach power purchase agreement and expected increases in the cost of coal and related transportation. 2006 vs. 2005: In 2006, our fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $24.7 million, or approximately 3.2%, when compared to 2005. Our average cost of fuel and purchased power increased from $23.80 per MWh in 2005 to $25.01 per MWh in 2006. The largest factor for the higher cost per MWh was a 24.2% increase in the per MWh cost of coal fired generation, which includes coal and related transportation costs, between the comparative periods. This increase was partially offset by increased generation from Point Beach and a decrease in the average costs of purchased power and fuel for our natural gas fired units. 47 Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Gas Utility Operations 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,481.2 $1,419.9 $1,417.5 Cost of Gas Sold 1,052.7 1,018.3 1,047.3 Gross Margin $428.5 $401.6 $370.2 We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $273.9 $255.0 $240.5 791.7 727.9 791.0 Commercial/Industrial 93.4 86.0 72.9 461.9 435.9 460.7 Interruptible 2.0 2.0 1.8 22.7 21.3 23.4 Total Retail Gas Sales 369.3 343.0 315.2 1,276.3 1,185.1 1,275.1 Transported Gas 51.7 51.3 48.5 921.6 843.8 893.7 Other Operating 7.5 7.3 6.5 Total $428.5 $401.6 $370.2 2,197.9 2,028.9 2,168.8 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,627 Normal) 6,508 6,043 6,628 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2007 vs. 2006: Our gas margins increased by $26.9 million, or 6.7%, between the comparative periods. We estimate that approximately $21.7 million of this increase related to increased sales as a result of more normal winter weather. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were approximately 7.7% colder in 2007 as compared to 2006. As a result, our retail therm deliveries increased approximately 7.7% from 2006. In addition, we estimate that our gas margins improved by $6.6 million due to a rate order that went into effect in the latter part of January 2006 and was effective for the entire twelve months ended December 31, 2007. We expect our gas margins to increase in 2008 primarily because of pricing increases as a result of the January 2008 rate order. In addition, 2008 gross margins will be impacted by weather and customer demand. For more information on the pricing increases, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 2006 vs. 2005: Our gas margin increased by $31.4 million, or 8.5%, between the comparative periods. The increase in gross margin was due, in part, to pricing increases that were granted by the PSCW and implemented in January 2006. The gas pricing increases were primarily granted to recover higher operating costs, including bad debt expenses. We estimate that our gross margin increased between the comparative periods by approximately $53.4 million due to these pricing increases. 48 The 2006 pricing increases were partially offset by a decline in gas sales volumes that was driven by mild winter weather and by lower customer usage. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were approximately 8.8% warmer in 2006 as compared to 2005. The mild winter weather reduced customer demand for heating. We estimate that the weather decreased our gross margin by approximately $21.0 million between the comparative periods. In 2006, we saw a reduction in normalized use of gas per customer which we believe was caused by high natural gas prices and the continued improvements in energy efficient appliances. During 2006, we estimate this reduction in normalized use decreased our gross margin by approximately $4.9 million. The decrease in volume of transport gas sales was due in part to fuel switching during months where gas commodity prices were high during 2006. Residential therm deliveries decreased 8.0% as compared to 2005, due to warmer weather and a decrease in use per cust omer that was driven in part by high commodity prices. Other Operation and Maintenance Expense 2007 vs. 2006: Our other operation and maintenance expense decreased by $36.9 million, or 3.0%, when compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily because of a decline in nuclear operations of approximately $37.8 million because we owned Point Beach for only nine months in 2007 as compared to a full year in 2006. Additionally, fossil operations decreased by approximately $6.0 million due to fewer planned outages in 2007 as compared to 2006. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $12.7 million in regulatory amortizations as a result of the January 2006 rate order. The January 2006 rate order covered increased expenses related to transmission costs, bad debt costs and PTF costs. Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by wage inflation, employee benefit costs, plant outages and the amortization of regulatory assets. While we expect our 2008 other operation and maintenance costs to decline as a result of the Point Beach sale, we expect a net increase in 2008 costs because of increased amortization of regulatory assets as directed by the January 2008 rate order. 2006 vs. 2005: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $200.7 million, or 19.9%, when compared to 2005. As discussed above, we received pricing increases in January 2006 to cover increased costs. The increases in other operation and maintenance expenses that relate to the pricing increases include higher PTF lease costs of $85.4 million, increased transmission expenses of $62.7 million, increased renewable energy and energy efficiency program expenses of $10.6 million and increased bad debt expenses of $13.7 million. Other operation and maintenance expenses increased approximately $34.7 million due to PWGS 1 operating costs and the timing of scheduled outages and maintenance projects at our coal plants. In 2005, we received approximately $10.0 million as a settlement to resolve a vendor dispute, reducing other operation and maintenance expense in 2005. These increases were partially offset by decreased nuclear operating and mai ntenance expense. In 2006, we had only one scheduled nuclear refueling outage as compared to two scheduled refueling outages in 2005, which resulted in approximately a $10.9 million decrease in nuclear operation and maintenance expenses between the comparative periods. In addition, the elimination of seams elimination transmission charges, effective March 31, 2006, resulted in reduced costs of approximately $9.5 million for 2006. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expense 2007 vs. 2006: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense increased by $1.2 million, or 0.4%, when compared to 2006. This increase was the result of increased depreciation for normal plant additions and coal related environmental controls that were placed in service in November 2006. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and decommissioning costs as a result of the sale of Point Beach in September 2007. We expect depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense to decline slightly in 2008 because we no longer own Point Beach. This decline is expected to be partially offset by normal plant additions and the addition of new wind generation. 2006 vs. 2005: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense decreased by $10.1 million, or 3.1%, when compared to 2005. In January 2006, we implemented new depreciation rates approved by the PSCW which reduced annual depreciation expense. We estimate that the new rates reduced annual depreciation expense by approximately $17.0 million, which was offset, in part, by net plant additions in 2006. 49 Amortization of Gain In connection with the sale of Point Beach, we recorded a net gain of approximately $902.2 million, representing a net gain on the sale and the decommissioning assets retained by the Company. We reached agreements with our respective regulators whereby we deferred the gain as a regulatory liability as it would be used for the benefit of our customers, primarily in the form of bill credits. We will amortize the regulatory liability to income as we issue customer bill credits. During 2007, we issued $6.5 million of bill credits to Michigan customers. In 2008 and 2009, we expect to amortize approximately $359.3 million and $255.3 million of the deferred gain, respectively, as we issue additional customer bill credits. In addition, in 2008 the PSCW authorized a one time amortization of approximately $85.0 million to match the amortization of $85.0 million of regulatory assets, which will be reflected in the first quarter of 2008. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME The most significant subsidiary included in this segment is We Power, which constructs and owns power plants associated with our PTF strategy and leases them to Wisconsin Electric. This segment primarily reflects revenues billed under the PWGS 1 lease and the depreciation expense related to PWGS 1. The following table compares our non utility energy segments operating income during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Non Utility Energy Segment 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $75.7 $69.1 $40.0 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 15.9 14.4 14.4 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 12.1 11.2 5.9 Property and Revenue Taxes 0.3 0.4 0.2 Operating Income $47.4 $43.1 $19.5 Note: The PTF lease revenues and lease costs recorded by the non utility and utility energy segments are eliminated in consolidation. 2007 vs. 2006: Our non utility energy segment contributed $47.4 million of operating income in 2007 compared to operating income of $43.1 million in 2006. This increase was primarily related to the Oak Creek coal handling system that was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2007. Our non utility energy segment is expected to generate higher operating income in 2008 as PWGS 2 is anticipated to be placed in service during the second quarter of 2008 and as we recognize a full year of revenue from the Oak Creek coal handling system. 2006 vs. 2005: Our non utility energy segment contributed $43.1 million of operating income in 2006 compared to operating income of $19.5 million in 2005. This increase in operating income primarily reflects a full year of operating income from PWGS 1 in 2006, which was placed in service in July 2005. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2007 vs. 2006: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $4.9 million in 2007 compared with an operating loss of $7.4 million in 2006. The favorable change was primarily related to our Wispark operations, which had operating income during 2007 as compared to operating losses throughout 2006. In the foreseeable future, we expect to have slight operating losses as we have minimal business operations in this segment. 50 2006 vs. 2005: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $7.4 million in 2006 compared with operating income of $1.0 million in 2005. The operating loss in 2006 was attributable to lower operating earnings at Wispark. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET The following table identifies the components of consolidated other income and deductions, net during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Other Income and Deductions, Net 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Carrying Costs $28.8 $25.0 $20.4 Gain (Loss) on Sale of Property 13.1 3.2 (3.0) Gain on Sale of Guardian Investment 2.8 AFUDC Equity 5.2 14.6 9.2 Other, net 1.8 7.5 2.1 Total Other Income and Deductions, Net $48.9 $53.1 $28.7 2007 vs. 2006: Other income and deductions, net decreased by $4.2 million when compared to 2006. The reduction primarily reflects a decrease in AFUDC of $9.4 million in connection with the environmental controls related to the new scrubber placed in service at our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant during the fourth quarter of 2006. This scrubber was installed as part of the implementation of our EPA consent decree. For further information on the consent decree with the EPA, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. This reduction was offset, in part, by an increase in gains on sales of property primarily associated with land sold in Northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. During 2008 we expect to see a significant reduction in Other income and deductions, net because we will stop accruing carrying costs on substantially all of our regulatory assets because the January 2008 rate order included these regulatory assets as a component of rate base. 2006 vs. 2005: Other income and deductions, net increased by $24.4 million when compared to 2005. The largest increases relate to increased AFUDC Equity of $5.4 million, capitalized carrying costs of $4.6 million and the pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in Guardian of $2.8 million. For further information on the sale of Guardian, see Other Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources. CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest Expense 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Interest Costs $240.9 $212.6 $202.1 Less: Capitalized Interest 73.3 39.9 28.7 Interest Expense, Net $167.6 $172.7 $173.4 2007 vs. 2006: Interest expense, net decreased by $5.1 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. Our gross interest costs increased by $28.3 million because of higher debt levels primarily related to our PTF construction program. However, our capitalized interest increased by $33.4 million due to higher levels of construction in progress at our PTF plants, which resulted in a reduction of our net interest expense. 51 We expect total interest expense in 2008 to increase due to increased debt levels to fund our planned construction activity; however, these increases are expected to be mitigated by increases in our capitalized interest. 2006 vs. 2005: Interest expense, net decreased by $0.7 million in 2006 when compared with 2005. Our gross interest costs increased by $10.5 million primarily due to increased debt levels; however, our capitalized interest increased by $11.2 million due to higher CWIP balances. In addition, in 2005 we expensed approximately $6.2 million related to the amortization of costs associated with prior debt redemptions. These costs were fully amortized as of July 2005; therefore, there was no similar expense in 2006. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 2007 vs. 2006: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 39.2% in 2007 compared to 35.9% in 2006. In 2006, we reversed $5.8 million of valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding these items, our 2006 effective tax rate was 37.1%. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2008 annual effective tax rate to range between 36% and 38%. The reduction in our effective tax rate is expected to result from the regulatory treatment of production tax deductions and wind credits. These items were considered by the PSCW in setting our rates in the 2008 rate order; therefore, we do not expect the lower effective tax rate to have a significant impact on net income. 2006 vs. 2005: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.9% in 2006 compared to 33.0% in 2005. In 2006 and 2005, we reversed $5.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively, of valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding these items, our 2006 and 2005 effective tax rate was 37.1% and 36.6%, respectively. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The following table identifies the primary components of net income (loss) from discontinued operations during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Discontinued Operations 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Manufacturing $ $2.4 $ Non Utility and Other (0.9) 1.5 5.1 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax ($0.9) $3.9 $5.1 Our 2007 loss from discontinued operations reflects a decrease in the resolution of tax liabilities during 2007. Our 2006 earnings from discontinued operations reflect a loss on the sale of Minergy Neenah, the 2006 operations of the plant and income of approximately $2.4 million related to the favorable resolution of tax liabilities. Our 2005 earnings from discontinued operations reflect a gain on the sale of the Calumet facility, the favorable resolution of liabilities at Calumet and a downward adjustment to the carrying value of Minergy Neenah. See Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the transactions described above. 52 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2007, 2006 and 2005: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $532.5 $730.0 $579.0 Investing Activities ($543.2) ($939.5) ($699.2) Financing Activities $1.1 $173.3 $157.8 Operating Activities 2007 vs. 2006: Cash provided by operating activities was $532.5 million during 2007, which is $197.5 million lower than 2006. This decline was due primarily to higher tax payments, lower fuel recoveries and changes in working capital. In 2007, we paid approximately $108 million in cash taxes because of the Point Beach sale and the liquidation of the nuclear decommissioning trust. In addition, cash taxes from operating income were higher due to higher taxable income. Our cash from fuel collections was unfavorable in 2007 as compared to 2006 because in 2006 we over collected fuel and purchased power costs and in 2007 we under collected such costs. 2006 vs. 2005: Cash provided by operating activities for 2006 totaled $730.0 million, which is a $151.0 million improvement over 2005. There were two primary areas that drove this improvement in operating cash flows. During 2006, we estimate that our collections of fuel costs improved by nearly $95 million as we had favorable collections in 2006 and unfavorable recoveries and fuel cost deferrals in 2005. The other primary area related to the working capital requirements related to gas in storage. During 2006, we entered into certain contracts that reduced our need to inject gas in storage. In addition, lower gas commodity prices, offset by less withdrawals due to weather, have lowered working capital requirements between the comparative periods. We estimate that these items reduced our cash needs for gas in storage by approximately $77.0 million. Partially offsetting these items was an increase of cash taxes of approximately $107 million due to higher t axable earnings. Investing Activities 2007 vs. 2006: Cash used in investing activities was $543.2 million during 2007, an improvement of $396.3 million over 2006. The two most significant factors related to cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures and the unrestricted proceeds we received from the sale of Point Beach. Our 2007 capital expenditures exceeded $1.2 billion, an increase of $282.8 million over 2006. This increase was expected and it primarily reflects the continued construction efforts with our PTF generation plants. During 2007, we experienced a significant inflow of cash related to the sale of Point Beach; however, we restricted a significant amount of that cash as it will be used for the benefit of our customers. The 2007 cash flows related to the Point Beach sale are summarized as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Proceeds from the sale of Point Beach $924.1 Proceeds from the liquidation of decommissioning trusts 552.4 Total Proceeds 1,476.5 Less: Proceeds restricted for the benefit of customers, net of taxes and bill credits (731.6) Unrestricted cash to the Company $744.9 As the gain on the Point Beach sale is given back to customers, primarily in the form of bill credits, we will release the restricted cash. We expect approximately $408 million of restricted cash will be released as the Point Beach gain will be amortized to income in 2008 and the remaining balance will be released and amortized in future years. 53 2006 vs. 2005: During 2006, net cash outflows from investing activities were $939.5 million compared with net cash outflows of $699.2 million in 2005. This increase is primarily associated with the increased capital expenditures as construction progresses on our new generating plants. During 2006, we had significant capital expenditures related to the Oak Creek expansion and PWGS 2. The following table identifies capital expenditures by year: Capital Expenditures 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $540.3 $459.9 $458.6 We Power 667.3 466.1 276.4 Other 3.9 2.7 10.1 Total Capital Expenditures $1,211.5 $928.7 $745.1 Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Increase in Debt $148.4 $299.7 $291.9 Dividends on Common Stock (116.9) (107.6) (102.9) Common Stock, Net (31.7) (21.2) (28.1) Other 1.3 2.4 (3.1) Cash Provided by Financing $1.1 $173.3 $157.8 2007 vs. 2006: During 2007, cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 million compared to $173.3 million in 2006. This decline occurred because we did not issue as much net new debt in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decline in the amount of net new debt is directly related to the unrestricted cash we received from the sale of Point Beach as discussed above. During 2007, we issued $500 million principal amount of Junior Notes and we used the net proceeds from these notes to pay down short term debt incurred to fund our PTF construction and for other working capital purposes. In December 2007, Wisconsin Electric retired $250 million of 3.50% Notes due December 1, 2007. 2006 vs. 2005: During 2006, cash provided by financing activities was $173.3 million compared to $157.8 million in 2005. Wisconsin Energy retired at the scheduled maturity date $250.0 million of 5.875% Notes due April 1, 2006. Short term debt was issued to retire those notes. During 2006, short term debt increased approximately $455.6 million. In November 2006, Wisconsin Electric issued $300 million of 5.70% Debentures due December 1, 2036. The securities were issued under an existing $665 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The net proceeds from the sale were used to retire Wisconsin Electrics $200 million of 6 5/8% Debentures due November 15, 2006 at their scheduled maturity and to repay outstanding commercial paper incurred for working capital requirements. No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2007, 2006 or 2005. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 1.4 million shares at a cost of $67.8 million, 1.1 million shares at a cost of $48.0 million and 2.0 million shares at a cost of $75.1 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we received proceeds of $36.1 million, $26.8 million and $47.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent 54 agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligation under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. For additional information on the Junior Notes and other debt issues, see Note K Long Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among other things, called for us to sell non core assets and reduce our debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 58.6% at December 31, 2007 due primarily to these asset sales and the sale of Point Beach. For more information, see Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Over the next several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly lower than prior years. Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of insured tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amount of $147 million that were issued in 2004 (the 2004 Bonds). Since the 2004 Bonds were issued, they have borne interest at an "auction rate." Because of substantial disruptions in the auction rate bond market that occurred in early to mid February, 2008, Wisconsin Electric gave notice on February 15, 2008 of the exercise of its option to purchase all of the 2004 Bonds (in lieu of redemption) on March 4, 2008 at a purchase price of par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase. Wisconsin Electric intends to issue commercial paper to fund the purchase of the 2004 Bonds. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the 2004 Bonds and have them remarketed to third parties. Capital Resources We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2008 and the next several years primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. Beyond 2008, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by short term borrowings and the issuance of debt securities. In August 2007, Wisconsin Electric filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to issue up to $800 million in debt securities. The registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and, subject to market conditions, is available for use. We have access to capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash. Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas credit agreements provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $1.7 billion of available unused lines under our bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis and approximately $900.7 million of total consolidated short term debt outstanding. 55 We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2007. Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration Facility Term (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $900.0 $1.5 $898.5 April 2011 5 year Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $4.0 $496.0 March 2011 5 year Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 March 2011 5 year Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval. The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure for 2007 that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 2007 2006 Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,099.2 41.0% $3,349.2 44.3% $2,889.0 40.1% Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 0.4% 30.4 0.4% 30.4 0.4% Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 3,525.3 46.7% 3,275.3 43.4% 3,370.1 46.8% Short Term Debt 900.7 11.9% 900.7 11.9% 911.9 12.7% Total Capitalization $7,555.6 100.0% $7,555.6 100.0% $7,201.4 100.0% Total Debt $4,426.0 $4,176.0 $4,282.0 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 58.6% 55.3% 59.5% Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation and the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure. As described in Note J Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. 56 Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by S&P, Moodys and Fitch as of December 31, 2007: S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Unsecured Senior Debt BBB+ A3 A Unsecured Junior Notes BBB Baa1 BBB+ Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Secured Senior Debt A Aa3 AA Unsecured Debt A A1 A+ Preferred Stock BBB A3 A Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A1 A+ Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt BBB+ A3 A In July 2007, S&P affirmed the corporate credit ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and revised the ratings outlooks assigned each company from negative to stable. On June 15, 2006, Fitch affirmed the security ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and changed the security ratings outlook for Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from stable to negative. The security ratings outlooks assigned by Fitch for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas are stable. The security rating outlooks assigned by Moodys for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are all stable. We believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Capital Requirements Our estimated 2008, 2009 and 2010 capital expenditures are as follows: Capital Expenditures 2008 2009 2010 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $662.3 $592.4 753.3 We Power 516.5 217.2 40.3 Other 4.6 6.8 4.3 Total $1,183.4 $816.4 $797.9 57 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. Our capital requirements include the construction of the PTF units. Through December 31, 2007, we have expended approximately $2.0 billion of the approximately $2.6 billion in capital we estimate will be required to construct the 2,120 MW of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity. We anticipate that all of the PTF units will be completed during 2010. We expect the capital requirements to support our investment in new generation under PTF to come from a combination of internal and external sources. We Power, a non utility subsidiary, is constructing the new generating plants, which will be leased to Wisconsin Electric under 25 30 year lease agreements. We expect that Wisconsin Electric will recover the lease payments in its utility rates. In June 2005, we purchased the development rights to a wind farm project (Blue Sky Green Field) from Navitas Energy, Inc. After receiving the necessary approvals and permits, we began construction in June 2007. Wind turbine components began arriving at the site during the fourth quarter of 2007. We estimate that this project will add 145 MW of generating capacity and the capital cost of the project, excluding AFUDC, will be approximately $300 million. We currently expect the wind turbines to be placed into service by the second quarter of 2008. In addition, in October 2007 we provided notice to FPL Energy, a subsidiary of FPL, that we were exercising the option we received in connection with the sale of Point Beach to purchase all rights to a new wind farm site in central Wisconsin. Once the purchase is complete, we will proceed with securing approvals and permits for construction and operation, and we expect to install wind turbines with approximately 100 MW of generating capacity. We expect the wind turbines to be placed into service between late 2010 or 2011, subject to regulatory approvals and turbine availability. Investments in Outside Trusts: We have funded our pension obligations and certain other post retirement obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had investments that exceeded $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. For further information see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For further information, see Note P Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have identified three tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties but have been unable to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of any of these three variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. Instead, we account for one of these contracts as a capital lease and for the other two contracts as operating leases as reflected in the table below. We have included our contractual obligations under all three of these contracts in our Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments disclosure that follows. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 58 Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $6,484.7 $543.5 $414.9 $758.5 $4,767.8 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 437.5 33.6 71.1 76.5 256.3 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 135.1 37.0 44.3 35.4 18.4 Purchase Obligations (e) 14,280.1 1,386.3 1,772.4 889.1 10,232.3 Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 85.6 83.4 1.5 0.7 Total Contractual Obligations $21,423.0 $2,083.8 $2,304.2 $1,760.2 $15,274.8 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Principal and interest payments on our Long Term Debt and the Long Term Debt of our affiliates (excluding capital lease obligations). For the purpose of determining our contractual obligations and commercial commitments only, we assumed the Junior Notes would be retired in 2017 with the proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities pursuant to the terms of the RCC. (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for power purchase commitments. (d) Operating Lease Obligations for power purchase commitments and vehicle and rail car leases for Wisconsin Energy and affiliates. (e) Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. This includes the power purchase agreement for all of the energy produced by Point Beach. (f) Other Long Term Liabilities includes the expected 2008 supplemental executive retirement plan obligation and the non discretionary pension contribution. For additional information on employer contributions to our benefit plans see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above does not include FIN 48 liabilities. For further information regarding FIN 48 liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Obligations for utility operations by our utility affiliates have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. For a discussion of 2008, 2009 and 2010 estimated capital expenditures, see Capital Requirements above. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Large Construction Projects: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of two 545 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The order approved key financial terms of the leased 59 generation contracts including fixed construction costs of PWGS 1 at $309.6 million and PWGS 2 at $280.3 million (2001 dollars), respectively, subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate, force majeure, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future Port Washington. In addition, in November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW super critical pulverized coal generating units adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including a target construction cost of the Oak Creek expansion of $2.191 billion, plus, subject to PSCW approval, cost over runs of up to 5%, costs attributable to force majeure events, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion. Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, continuing legal challenges and appeals to granted permits, including the WPDES permit granted in connection with the Oak Creek expansion,, changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the courts or permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, other governmental actions and events in the global economy. If final costs for the construction of PWGS exceed the fixed costs allowed in the PSCW order, absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force majeure conditions, this excess will not adjust the amount of the lease payments recovered from Wisconsin Electric. If final costs of the Oak Creek expansion are within 5% of the target cost, and the additional costs are deemed to be prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs. Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extraordinary circumstances such as force majeure conditions. Regulatory Recovery: The electric operations of Wisconsin Electric burn natural gas in its leased power plants, in several of its peaking power plants and as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants. In addition, the cost of purchased power is generally tied to the cost of natural gas. Wisconsin Electric bears regulatory risk for the recovery of these fuel and purchased power costs when these costs are higher than the base rate established in its rate structure. For further information on the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs see Commodity Prices below. Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. SFAS 71 allows regulated entities to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amoun ts that are expected to be refunded to customers. Under SFAS 71, we record these items as regulatory liabilities. Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas and the cost of purchased power. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted prospectively. For 2008, we will operate under a traditional fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction whereby fuel revenues may be adjusted prospectively if fuel and purchased power costs 60 fall outside a pre established annual band of plus or minus 2%. For information regarding the 2008 fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for our gas utility operations through gas cost recovery mechanisms, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For information concerning the electric utility fuel cost adjustment procedure and the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. Natural Gas Costs: Significant increases in the cost of natural gas affect our electric and gas utility operations. Natural gas costs have increased because the supply of natural gas in recent years has not kept pace with the demand for natural gas. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas resources are developed. Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the State of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have not kept pace with rising natural gas costs over the recent year, our risks related to bad debt expenses have increased. In February 2005, the PSCW authorized the use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceed amounts allowed in rates. This authorization extends through March 2009. As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. Weather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2007, 2006 and 2005, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations. Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2007. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2007 of our outstanding portfolio of $900.7 million of short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.18% and $164.4 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.39%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $9.0 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $1.6 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return: We fund our pension and OPEB obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of expense and contribution variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. Through December 31, 2005, we were operating under a PSCW ordered, qualified five year rate restriction period. For further information about the rate restriction, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 61 At December 31, 2007, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments: Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,007.2 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $201.5 Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor. The current study for the pension fund projects long term annualized returns of approximately 8.5%. Credit Ratings: We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment only in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. At December 31, 2007, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payment required under these agreements totaled approximately $204.0 million. In addition, we have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties. Economic Conditions: We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment. Utility sales growth is impacted by Wisconsin employment and industrial production demand. Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the rising costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We have expectations of slightly elevated inflation in these costs and resultant energy costs in the near future. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. POWER THE FUTURE Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion by We Power. We Power will lease the new plants to Wisconsin Electric under long term leases, and we expect Wisconsin Electric to recover the lease payments in its electric rates. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units: Unit Name Expected In Service Authorized Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 (Actual) $ 333 million (Actual) PWGS 2 Second Quarter 2008 $ 329 million OC 1 2009 $ 1,300 million OC 2 2010 $ 640 million (a) Authorized cash costs represent the PSCW approved costs and the increases for factors such as inflation as identified in the PSCW approved lease terms for PWGS 2, and adjusted for our ownership percentages in the case of OC 1 and OC 2. 62 The lease payments are based on the cash costs authorized by the PSCW. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the OC Units. The interest component of the return is determined up to 180 days prior to the date that the units are placed in service. Power the Future Port Washington Background: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of the PWGS consisting of two 545 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant. The Port Order also authorized Wisconsin Gas to proceed with the construction of a connecting natural gas lateral, which was completed in December 2004, and it authorized ATC to construct transmission system upgrades to serve PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. PWGS 1 was completed in July 2005 and placed into service at that time. PWGS 1 was completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. In October 2003, we received approval from FERC to transfer by long term lease certain associated FERC jurisdictional transmission related assets from We Power to Wisconsin Electric. Construction of PWGS 2 is well underway. Site preparation, including removal of the o ld coal units at the site, was completed in early 2006, and all of the major components have been procured. The unit is expected to begin commercial operation in the second quarter of 2008. Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms. In January 2003, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to defer costs for recovery in future rates. The PSCW approved the request in an open meeting in April 2003. We Power began collecting certain costs from Wisconsin Electric in the third quarter of 2003 as provided for in lease generation contracts that were signed in May 2003. We defer the lease costs on our balance sheet, and we amortize the costs to expense as we recover the costs in rates. Legal and Regulatory Matters: There are currently no legal challenges to the construction of PWGS and all construction permits have been received for PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to FERCs jurisdiction. Under FERCs rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of PWGS 2 through a lease arrangement between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC for this asset transfer in December 2006. Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion Background: In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Oak Creek Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW coal fired units (the Oak Creek expansion) to be located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. We anticipate OC 1 will be operational in 2009 and OC 2 will be operational in 2010. The Oak Creek Order concluded, among other things, that there was a need for additional electric generation for Southeastern Wisconsin and that a diversity of fuel sources best serves the interests of the State. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental 63 permits. All necessary permits have been received at this time. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site. In November 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest in the project to two unaffiliated entities, who will share ratably in the construction costs. The Oak Creek expansion includes a new coal handling system that will serve both the existing units at Oak Creek and OC 1 and OC 2. The new coal handling system was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2007 at a cost of approximately $171.2 million. Lease Terms: In October 2004, the PSCW approved the lease generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power for the Oak Creek expansion. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Oak Creek Order, which do not include the key financial terms. Legal and Regulatory Matters: The CPCN granted for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion was the subject of a number of legal challenges by third parties; these legal challenges were resolved in June 2005. We have received all permits necessary to commence construction, which began in June 2005. Certain of these permits continue to be contested, but remain in effect unless and until overturned by a reviewing court or ALJ. A contested case hearing for the WPDES permit was held in March 2006. The ALJ upheld the issuance of the permit in a decision issued in July 2006. In August 2006, the opponents filed in Dane County Circuit Court for judicial review of the ALJs decision upholding the issuance of the permit. In March 2007, the Dane County Circuit Court affirmed in part the decision by the ALJ to uphold the WDNRs issuance of the permit. The Court also remanded certain aspects of the ALJs decision for further consideration based on the January 2007 decision by the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concerning the federal rule on cooling water intake systems for existing facilities (the Phase II rule) (Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 475 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2007)). The Second Circuit found certain portions of the Phase II rule impermissible and remanded several parts of the Phase II rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. Consistent with it s announcement in March, in July 2007, the EPA formally suspended the Phase II rule in its entirety and directed states to use their "best professional judgment" in evaluating intake systems for existing facilities. In November 2007, the ALJ determined that the two additional coal fired units, OC 1 and OC 2, are new facilities under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The ALJ did not vacate the WPDES permit or any other permit necessary to continue construction of the two units, pointing out that, based upon the present record, the water intake system currently under construction as part of the Oak Creek expansion may be permittable under the standards that apply to new facilities. The ALJ remanded the WPDES permit to the WDNR and directed the WDNR to reissue or modify the permit to reflect "best technology available" to comply with the standards applicable to new facilities under Wisconsin state law. As part of the decision, the ALJ restated his prior opinion that the water intake system currently under construction may not be operated until the Wisconsin Division of Hearings and Appeals hears any challenge to a reissued or modified permit. We believe that there are alternatives under the EPA rule for new facilities that would permit the use of the once through cooling system under construction rather than the use of cooling towers. We have requested that the WDNR issue a modified permit that authorizes the use of the once through cooling system under the Phase I rule, have submitted information in support of that request and anticipate making additional information submissions in the near future. We anticipate that the WDNR will issue a modified permit in the first half of 2008. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty what the WDNRs decision will be. A re issued or modified permit will be subject to a public comment period and can be challenged in a hearing before the Wisconsin Division of Hearings and Appeals 64 or through judicial review. While the process for modifying the WPDES permit proceeds, we will continue construction of OC 1 and OC 2 on the current schedule. In addition, we filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court a petition for judicial review of the ALJs decision. We took this action, even though we did not believe that the ALJs decision is a "final order" that is reviewable, to ensure that we did not lose our right to appeal. The City of Oak Creek and the WDNR also filed petitions for judicial review and the petitions were consolidated into a single case. At the time that we filed our petition for review, we also filed a motion requesting a determination from the court that the ALJ order is not final and, therefore, not subject to judicial review at this time. On February 11, 2008, the Court granted our motion dismissing the three petitions for review on the grounds that the ALJs decision is not a final order and further ruled that all issues decided by the ALJ may be judicially reviewed when there is a final agency decision. As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation), an activity that previously was not subject to FERCs jurisdiction. Under FERCs rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of OC 1 and OC 2 through a lease arrangement between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC on these leases in December 2006. UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the State of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the State of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 88% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 5% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. All of our natural gas and water revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of the recent Wisconsin Electric rate changes: Incremental Annualized Percent Revenue Change Effective Service Wisconsin Electric Increase in Rates Date (Millions) Retail electric, Wisconsin $389.1 17.2% January 17, 2008 Retail gas, Wisconsin $4.0 0.6% January 17, 2008 Retail steam, Wisconsin $3.6 11.2% January 17, 2008 Retail electric, Michigan $0.3 0.6% May 23, 2007 Fuel electric, Michigan $3.4 7.5% January 1, 2007 Retail electric, Wisconsin $222.0 10.6% January 26, 2006 Retail gas, Wisconsin $21.4 2.9% January 26, 2006 Retail steam, Wisconsin $7.8 31.5% January 26, 2006 Fuel electric, Michigan $2.7 5.9% January 1, 2006 Fuel electric, Wisconsin $7.7 0.3% November 24, 2005 Fuel electric, Michigan $2.5 5.8% November 1, 2005 Retail electric, Wisconsin $59.7 3.1% May 19, 2005 Retail steam, Wisconsin $0.5 3.6% May 19, 2005 Fuel electric, Wisconsin $114.9 5.9% March 18, 2005 Fuel electric, Michigan $3.4 8.0% January 1, 2005 65 2008 Pricing: During 2007, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings. Wisconsin Electric asked the PSCW to approve a comprehensive plan which would result in price increases of $648.6 million for its electric customers in Wisconsin. This price increase would be reduced by expected bill credits resulting from the sale of Point Beach. The initial rate filing estimated bill credits of $371.0 million in 2008 and $187.5 million in 2009, resulting in net pricing increases of 7.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested a 1.8% price increase in 2008 for its gas customers and an approximately 16.0% price increase in 2008 for all steam customers in Milwaukee. Wisconsin Gas filed for a 4.1% price increase in 2008 for its gas customers. Electric pricing increases were needed to allow us to continue progress on previously approved initiatives, including: costs associated with our new PTF plants; recovery of costs associated with transmission; compliance with environmental regulations; continuation of investment in renewable and efficiency programs, including the new wind facilities approved by the PSCW in February 2007; and scheduled recovery of regulatory assets. On January 17, 2008, the PSCW approved pricing increases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas as follows: $389.1 million (17.2%) in electric rates for Wisconsin Electric the pricing increase will be offset by $315.9 million in bill credits in 2008 and $240.7 million in bill credits in 2009, resulting in a net increase of $73.2 million (3.2%) and $75.2 million (3.2%), respectively; $4.0 million (0.6%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Electric; $3.6 million (11.2%) for steam service from Wisconsin Electric; and $20.1 million (2.2%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Gas. In addition, the PSCW lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from 11.2% to 10.75%. The PSCW also determined that $85.0 million of the Point Beach proceeds should be immediately applied to offset certain regulatory assets. Wisconsin Electric expects to provide a total of approximately $669.7 million of bill credits to its Wisconsin customers over the three year period ending 2010. Michigan Price Increase Request: On January 31, 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the MPSC. This request represents an increase in electric rates of 14.7%, or $22.0 million, to support the growing demand for electricity, continued investment in renewable programs, compliance with environmental regulations, addition of distribution infrastructure and increased operational expenses. This filing also includes a request for immediate rate relief of 5.6%, or approximately $8.4 million. We expect an order from the MPSC during the third quarter of 2008. 2006 Pricing: In January 2006, Wisconsin Electric received an order from the PSCW that allowed it to increase annual electric revenues by approximately $222.0 million, or 10.6%, to recover increased costs associated with investments in our PTF units, transmission services and fuel and purchased power, as well as costs associated with additional sources of renewable energy. The rate increase was based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%. The order also required Wisconsin Electric to refund to customers, with interest, any fuel revenues that it receives that are in excess of fuel and purchased power costs that it incurs, as defined by the Wisconsin fuel rules. The original order stipulated that any refund would also include interest at short term rates. This refund provision did not extend past December 31, 2006. During 2006, we experienced lower than expected fuel and purchased power costs. In September 2006, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to refund favorable fuel recoveries including accrued interest at a short term rate. In addition, in September 2006 the PSCW determined that if the total recoveries for 2006 exceeded $36 million, interest on the amount in excess of $36 million would be paid at the rate of 11.2%, our authorized return on equity rather than at short term rates as originally set forth in the order. During October 2006, we refunded $28.7 million, including interest, to Wisconsin retail customers as a credit on their bill and we received approval from the PSCW to refund an additional $10 million, including interest, in the first quarter of 2007. During 2007, Wisconsin Electric operated under a traditional fuel cost adjustment clause in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction whereby fuel revenues could have been adjusted prospectively if fuel and purchased power costs fell outside a pre established annual band of plus or minus 2%. 66 Our gas operations went through a traditional rate proceeding whereby the revenues were set to recover projected costs and to provide a return on rate base. The January 2006 order provided for increases in gas revenues totaling $60.1 million ($21.4 million or 2.9% for Wisconsin Electric gas operations and $38.7 million or 3.7% for Wisconsin Gas gas operations). The rate increases were based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2% for the gas operations of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. The steam rate proceeding was a traditional rate proceeding. The January 2006 order provided for an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million, or 31.5%, to be phased in over a two year period beginning in 2006. The rate increase was based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%. Limited Rate Adjustment Requests 2005 Fuel Recovery Filing: In February 2005, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric rates in the amount of $114.9 million due to the increased costs of fuel and purchased power as a result of customer growth and the increase in the reliance upon natural gas as a fuel source. We received approval for the increase in fuel recoveries on an interim basis in March 2005. In November 2005, we received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $7.7 million in rate increases, for a total increase of $122.6 million (6.2%). In December 2005, two parties filed suit against the PSCW in Dane County Circuit Court challenging the PSCWs decision to allow fuel cost recovery, while allowing us to keep the savings that resulted from the WICOR acquisition. As a condition of the PSCW approval of the WICOR acquisition, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas were restricted from increasing Wisconsin rates for a five year period ending December 31, 2005, with certain limited exceptions, but we were allowed to keep the savings generated from the merger. In July 2006, the Dane County Circuit Court affirmed the PSCWs decision. In August 2006, the opponents appealed this decision to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. In July 2007, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Dane County Circuit Court decision upholding the PSCW order. The time period for appeal has expired and no appeals were filed. 2005 Revenue Deficiencies: In May 2004, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW for an increase in electric and steam rates for anticipated 2005 revenue deficiencies associated with (1) costs for the new PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion being constructed as part of our PTF strategy, (2) costs associated with our energy efficiency procurement plan and (3) costs associated with making changes to our steam utility systems as part of the construction of the Marquette Interchange highway project in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The filing identified anticipated revenue deficiencies in 2005 attributable to Wisconsin in the amount of $84.8 million (4.5%) for the electric operations of Wisconsin Electric and $0.5 million (3.6%) for Wisconsin Electrics steam operations. In January 2005, as a result of the litigation involving our Oak Creek expansion, we amended this filing to reduce the total revenue request to $52.4 million. In May 2005, th e PSCW issued its final written order implementing an annualized increase in electric rates of $59.7 million (3.1%) and an increase of $0.5 million (3.6%) in steam rates. Other Utility Rate Matters Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we defer transmission costs that exceed amounts embedded in our rates. We are allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2007, we have deferred $240.9 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The January 2008 rate order provided for the recovery of these costs over six years; and the e scrow accounting treatment has been discontinued. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: Within the State of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Embedded within its base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules, no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a band of the costs embedded in current rates for the twelve month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs 67 are expected to fall outside of the band, and actual costs fall outside of established fuel bands, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. For 2008, the band is plus or minus 2%. In June 2006, the PSCW opened a docket (01 AC 224) in which it was looking into revising the current fuel rules (Chapter PSC 116). In February 2007, five Wisconsin utilities regulated by the fuel rules, including Wisconsin Electric, filed a joint proposal to modify the existing rules in this docket. The proposal recommends modifying the rules to allow for escrow accounting for fuel costs outside a plus or minus 1% annual band of fuel costs allowed in rates. It further recommends that the escrow balance be trued up annually following the end of each calendar year. We are unable to predict if or when the PSCW will make any changes to the existing fuel rules. Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electrics operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs on a dollar for dollar basis. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. There is an incentive mechanism under the GCRM which allows for increased revenues if we acquire gas lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, no additional revenues were earned under the incentive portion of the GCRM. Bad Debt Costs: In January 2006, the PSCW issued an order approving the amortization over the next five years of bad debts deferred in 2004 for our gas operations. The bad debts deferred in 2004 related to electric operations will be considered for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW. In February 2005, the PSCW approved our use of escrow accounting for residential bad debt costs. The final decision was received in March 2005. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As a result of this approval from the PSCW, which extends through March 2009, we escrowed approximately $8.9 million, $3.7 million and $17.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to bad debt costs. The January 2008 rate order allowed for the continued use of escrow accounting. MISO Energy Markets: In January 2005, we requested deferral accounting treatment from the PSCW for certain incremental costs or benefits that may occur due to the implementation on April 1, 2005 of the MISO Energy Markets. We received approval for this accounting treatment in March 2005. Additionally, in March 2005 we submitted a joint proposal to the PSCW with other utilities requesting escrow accounting treatment for the MISO Energy Markets costs until each utilitys first rate case following April 1, 2008. The purpose of the March 2005 request for escrow accounting was to provide clarification on costs not included in the March 2005 approval for deferral accounting treatment. The PSCW approved deferral treatment for these costs in June 2006. In August 2007, the PSCW issued an order that adjusted the deferral treatment for certain MISO costs and determined that deferral accounting would end December 31, 2007.

Coal Generation Forced Outage 2007: In March 2007, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to defer as a regulatory asset approximately $13.2 million related to replacement power costs due to a forced outage of Unit 1 at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. The outage extended from February 2007 through March 2007. These costs will be recovered as part of the 2008 rate order. Wholesale Electric Rates: In August 2006, Wisconsin Electric filed a wholesale rate case with FERC. The filing requested an annual increase in rates of approximately $16.7 million applicable to four existing wholesale electric customers. This includes a mechanism for fuel and other cost adjustments. In November 2006, FERC accepted the rate filing subject to refund with interest. Three of the existing customers rates were effective in January 2007. The remaining wholesale customers rates were effective in May 2007. FERC approved a settlement of the rate filing in September 2007. Depreciation Rates: In January 2005, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed a joint application with the PSCW for certification of depreciation rates for specific classes of utility plant assets. In November 2005, we received notice from the PSCW that the proposed estimated lives, net salvage values and depreciation rates were approved and became effective January 1, 2006. For more information, see Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 68 Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin enacted new public benefits legislation, Act 141, which changes the renewable energy requirements for utilities. Act 141 requires Wisconsin utilities to provide 2% more of their total retail energy from renewable resources than their current levels by 2010, and 6% more renewable energy than their current levels by 2015. Act 141 establishes a statewide goal that 10% of all electricity in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Assuming the bulk of additional renewables is wind turbines, Wisconsin Electric must obtain approximately 210 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2010 and another approximately 610 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2015 to meet the retail energy delivered requirements. We have already started development of additional sources of renewable energy to comply with commitments made as part of our PTF initiative which will assist us in complying with Act 141. See Wind Generation discussion below. Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would be too expensive or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. The previous law did not include similar provisions. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility is considered in compliance with the Energy Priorities law. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable en ergy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels. We continue to implement the requirements of Act 141. The PSCW has completed two rule making proceedings required by the law. These proceedings dealt with renewable energy credits and conditions for utility and business voluntary participation in providing energy efficiency programs. Effective July 1, 2007, we began to pay the required 1.2% charge to support energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs in Wisconsin as required by Act 141. Wind Generation: In June 2005, we purchased the development rights to a wind farm project (Blue Sky Green Field) from Navitas Energy, Inc. After receiving the necessary approvals and permits we began construction in June 2007. Wind turbine components began arriving at the site during the fourth quarter of 2007. We estimate that the capital cost of the project, excluding AFUDC, will be approximately $300 million. We currently expect the wind turbines to be placed into service by the second quarter of 2008. In addition, in October 2007 we provided notice to FPL Energy, a subsidiary of FPL, that we were exercising the option we received in connection with the sale of Point Beach to purchase all rights to a new wind farm site in central Wisconsin. Once the purchase is complete, we will proceed with securing approvals and permits for construction and operation, and we expect to install wind turbines with approximately 100 MW of generating capacity. We expect the wind turbines to be placed into service between late 2010 or 2011, subject to regulatory approvals and turbine availability. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy. We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2007. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract 69 were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2008. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures during 2008 as we have in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as CO2, SO2, NOx, small particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash and (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites. We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including (1) substituting new and cleaner generating facilities for older facilities as part of our PTF strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) reviewing water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water requirements, (4) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules, (5) entering into agreements with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013, (6) evaluating and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems, (7) continuing the beneficial re use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units and (8) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA consent decree is estimated to be approximately $1 billio n over the 10 years ending 2013. These costs are principally associated with the installation of air quality controls on Pleasant Prairie Units 1 and 2 and Oak Creek Units 5 8. In June 2007, we submitted an application to the PSCW requesting approval to construct environmental controls at Oak Creek Units 5 8 by 2012 as required by the Consent Decree. We estimate the cost of this project to be approximately $750 million. Through December 31, 2007, we have spent approximately $381.0 million associated with implementing the EPA agreement. For further information concerning the Consent Decree, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In 2000 and 2001, Michigan and Wisconsin finalized state rules implementing phased emission reductions required to meet the NAAQS for 1 hour ozone. In 2004, the EPA began implementing NAAQS for 8 hour ozone and PM2.5. In December 2006, the EPA further revised the PM2.5 standard, and in June 2007, the EPA announced its proposal to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard. 8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in Southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. States were required to develop and submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. The rule that applies to emissions from our power plants in the affected areas of Wisconsin has been adopted by the state. The required reductions will be accomplished through implementation of the CAIR. (See below for further information regarding CAIR.) We believe compliance with the NOx emission reduction requirements under the agreement with the EPA will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the EPAs 8 hour ozone NAAQS. In June 2007, the EPA announced its proposal to further lower the 8 hour standard. Until this proposal becomes a final rule, we are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our existing coal fired generation fac ilities. PM2.5 Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated PM2.5 non attainment areas in the country. All counties in Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. It is unknown at this time whether Wisconsin or Michigan will require additional emission reductions as part of state or regional implementation of the PM2.5 standard and what impact those requirements would have on operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities. In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard became effective, which may place some counties into non attainment status. This standard is currently being litigated. Until such time as the states develop rules and submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the standard, we are unable to predict the impact of this more restrictive standard on the operation of our 70 existing coal fired generation facilities or our new PTF generating units being leased by Wisconsin Electric including OC 1, OC 2 and PWGS. Clean Air Interstate Rule: The EPA issued the final CAIR regulation in March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8 hour ozone and PM2.5 standards by addressing the regional transport of SO2 and NOx. CAIR requires NOx and SO2 emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28 state region within the eastern United States. Wisconsin and Michigan are affected states under CAIR. The phase 1 compliance deadline is January 1, 2009 for NOx and January 1, 2010 for SO2, and the phase 2 compliance deadline is January 1, 2015 for both NOx and SO2. Overall, the CAIR is expected to result in a 70% reduction in SO2 emissions and a 65% reduction in NOx emissions from 2002 emission levels. The states were required to develop and submit implementation plans by no later than March 2007. A final CAIR rule has been adopted in Wiscons in and Michigan. We believe that compliance with the NOx and SO2 emission reductions requirements under the Consent Decree will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the CAIR rule. Clean Air Mercury Rule: The EPA issued the final CAMR in March 2005, following the agencys 2000 regulatory determination that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. CAMR would limit mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants, and cap utility mercury emission in two phases, applicable in 2010 and 2018. The caps would limit emissions at approximately 20% and ultimately 70% below todays utility mercury levels. Because the control technology is under development, it is difficult to estimate what the cost would be to comply with the CAMR requirements. We believe the range of possible expenditures could be approximately $50 million to $200 million. The construction Air Permit issued for the Oak Creek expansion is not impacted by CAMR. The federal rule was challenged by a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. On February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CAMR and sent the rule back to EPA for re consideration. At this time, we cannot predict the timing or impact on our operations of a future federal rule. In October 2004, the WDNR issued mercury emission control rules that affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin rules explicitly recognize an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal program and require that the WDNR must adopt state rule changes within 18 months of publication of any federal rules. In March 2007, the WDNR proposed changes to this rule to include an implementation plan for CAMR, along with a proposal for more stringent state only rules. WDNR did not take any final action on the March 2007 rule proposal. The 2004 state rule will continue to apply to our Wisconsin facilities, unless and until it is revised in the future. This rule requires mercury emission reductions from existing coal fueled units in three phases, beginning with an emission cap in 2008, and followed by a 40% reduction requirement by 2010 and a 75% reduction requirement by 2015. As of January 2008, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has also proposed a rule to both implement CAMR and impose state only requirements for achieving 90% emission reductions in 2015. At this time, we cannot predict how the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality will proceed with their rule proposal and its impact on our operations. As part of a new technology demonstration which the company undertook in partnership with the DOE, technology for the control of mercury has been installed at Presque Isle Power Plant. We plan to continue the operation of that equipment beyond the test period. Until the Michigan rule is promulgated, it is not known if that equipment will be sufficient to comply with reductions that might be required under that rule. Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the CAVR in June 2005 to address regional haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines BART requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. Under CAVR, states are required to identify certain industrial facilities and power plants that affect visibility in the nations 156 Class I protected areas. States are then required to determine the types of emission controls that those facilities must use to control their emissions. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include particulate matter or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. States were required to submit plans to implement CAVR to the EPA by December 2007. The reductions associated with the state plans are scheduled to begin to take effect in 2014, with full implementation be fore 2018. Wisconsin is in the final phase of promulgating rules which cover one aspect of the regulations. We do not believe that these rules, if adopted in their current form, will have a material impact on our costs. Michigan has not yet issued a draft rule. Until the rules are final, we are unable to predict the impact on our system. 71 Clean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the CWA requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impact. This law dates back to 1972; however, prior to September 2004, there were no federal rules that defined precisely how states and EPA regions determined that an existing intake met BTA requirements. The Phase II rule established, for the first time, national performance standards and compliance alternatives for existing facilities that are designed to minimize the potential adverse environmental impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the 316(b) rules for Wisconsin Electrics Oak Creek Power Plant, We Powers Oak Creek expansion and PWGS were included in project costs. In January 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision concerning the Phase II rule for existing facilities (Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 04 6692 ag(L) (2d Cir. 2007)). The Second Circuit found certain portions of the rule impermissible and remanded several parts of the Phase II rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. Consistent with its announcement in March, in July 2007, the EPA formally suspended the Phase II rule in its entirety and directed states to use their "best professional judgment" in evaluating intake systems. We will work with the relevant state agencies as permits for our facilities come due for renewal to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken. Until the EPA completes its reconsideration and rulemaking, we cannot predict what impact these changes to the federal rules may have on our facilities. For additional information on this matter related to the Oak Creek expansion, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion in this report. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. EPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric and the EPA announced that a Consent Decree had been reached that resolved all issues related to a request for information that had been issued by the EPA. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Greenhouse Gases: We continue to take voluntary measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support a voluntary approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including: Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units. Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that will be the most thermally efficient coal units in our system. Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation. Adding additional wind capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow&reg; renewable energy program. Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions continue to be considered in the U.S. Congress. Although the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined at this time, mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions" under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 72 LEGAL MATTERS Arbitration Proceedings: Our largest electric customers, two iron ore mines, operate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The mines represent approximately 6% of our annual electric sales; however, the earnings are insignificant to us. The mines had special negotiated contracts that expired in December 2007. The contracts had price caps for approximately 80% of the energy sales. We did not recognize revenue on amounts billed that exceeded the price caps. The incremental power costs in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are now determined by MISO. In April 2005, we began to bill the mines the incremental power costs as quantified by the MISO Energy Markets. The mines notified us that they were disputing these billings and a portion of these disputed amounts were deposited in escrow. In September 2005, the mines notified us that they filed for formal arbitration related to the contracts. We notified the mines that we believe that they failed to comply with certain notification provisions related to annual production as specified within the contracts. In May 2007, Wisconsin Electric entered into a settlement agreement with the mines. The settlement was a full and complete resolution of all claims and disputes between the parties for electric service rendered by Wisconsin Electric under the power purchase agreements through March 31, 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, the mines paid Wisconsin Electric approximately $9.0 million and Wisconsin Electric released to the mines all funds held in escrow. The estimated earnings impact of the payment from the mines was $0.04 per share. The settlement also provided a mutually satisfactory pricing structure through the power purchase agreement expiration date of December 31, 2007. Beginning January 1, 2008, the mines became eligible to receive electric service from Wisconsin Electric in accordance with tariffs approved by the MPSC. Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services. In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage, and, more recently, ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In May 2005, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in June 2007 and such settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Although we do not have any open stray voltage cases at this time, we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric previously owned two electric generating units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, Point Beach provided approximately 17.3%, 25.3% and 20.0%, respectively, of Wisconsin Electrics net electric energy supply. On September 28, 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the buyer purchased Point Beach, its nuclear fuel, associated inventories and assumed the obligation to decommission the plant. Wisconsin Electric retained approximately $506 million of the sales proceeds, which represents the net book value of the assets sold and certain transaction costs. In addition, 73 Wisconsin Electric has deferred the net gain on the sale of approximately $418 million as a regulatory liability and has deposited those proceeds into a restricted cash account. In connection with the sale, Wisconsin Electric also transferred $390 million of decommissioning funds to the buyer. Wisconsin Electric then liquidated the balance of the decommissioning trust assets and retained approximately $552 million, which was also placed into the restricted cash account. We intend to use the cash in the restricted cash account and the interest earned on the balance for the benefit of our customers and to pay certain taxes. Our regulators are directing the manner in which these proceeds will benefit customers. For further information on the 2008 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in this report. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we are paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule that is established in the agreement. Under the agreement, if our credit rating and the credit rating of Wisconsin Electric from either S&P or Moodys fall below investment grade, or if the holders of any indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million accelerate or have the right to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness as a result of a default, we would need to provide collateral in the amount of $100.0 million (escalating at 3% per year commencing in 2024). Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the NRC in December 2005. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach. On August 13, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint on November 16, 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. We anticipate a decision by the end of 2008 or during 2009. Wisconsin Electric incurred substantial damages prior to the sale of Point Beach and we are seeking recovery of our damages in this lawsuit and we expect that any recoveries would be considered in setting future rates. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented a bid based market, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation on April 1, 2005. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act, which impacts the electric utility industry. (See Other Matters below for additional information on the Energy Policy Act). In addition, major issues in industry restructuring, implementation of RTO markets and m arket 74 power mitigation received substantial attention in 2006 and prior years. We continue to focus on infrastructure issues through our PTF growth strategy. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused in recent years on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the State of Wisconsin. These issues include: Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state; and Addition of renewable generation. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: As of January 1, 2002, our Michigan retail customers were allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of two general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Electric Transmission and Energy Markets ATC: ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission owning member of MISO. As of February 1, 2002, operational control of ATCs transmission system was transferred to MISO, and Wisconsin Electric and Edison Sault became non transmission owning members and customers of MISO. MISO: In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO implemented a bid based energy market, the MISO Energy Markets, which commenced operations on April 1, 2005. As part of this energy market, MISO developed a market based platform for valuing transmission congestion and losses premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through FTRs. FTRs are allocated to market participants by MISO. A new allocation of FTRs was completed for the period of June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008. We were granted substantially all of the FTRs that we were permitted to request during the allocation process. Previously, our unhedged congestion costs had not been explicitly identified and were embedded in our fuel and purchased power expenses. The congestion charges are deferred as approved by the PSCW, and we expect to recover the costs in current rates, subject to review and approval by the PSCW. In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by LSEs located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. On February 1, 2008, FERC issued several orders confirming that the current transmission cost allocation methodology is just and reasonable and should continue in the future. These orders are subject to rehearings or appeals. In April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of RSG charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to April 1, 2005. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in accordance with the orders in July 2007. The resettlement was completed in 75 January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints. In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG Order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This Order provided a clarification that is contrary to how MISO has been implementing the resettlements. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing or clarification. In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO has been ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. At this time, we are unable to determine the resulting financial impact associated with this proceeding. MISO is in the process of developing a market for two ancillary services, regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In February 2007, MISO filed tariff revisions to include ancillary services. The MISO ancillary services market is expected to begin in June 2008. We currently self provide both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we expect that we will buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market is expected to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market is also expected to enable MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. OTHER MATTERS Energy Policy Act: In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act includes tax subsidies for electric utilities and the repeal of PUHCA 1935. The Energy Policy Act also amends federal energy laws and provides FERC with new oversight responsibilities for the electric utility industry. Implementation of the Energy Policy Act requires the development of regulations by federal agencies, including FERC. As noted above, the Energy Policy Act and corresponding rules required us to seek FERC authorization to allow Wisconsin Electric to lease from We Power the three PTF units that are currently being constructed by We Power. We received approval of these leases from FERC in December 2006. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005, transferring jurisdiction over holding companies from the SEC to FERC. Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric were exempt holding companies under PUHCA 1935, and, accordingly, were exempt from that laws provisions other than with respect to certain acquisitions of securities of a public utility. In March 2006, Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric each filed with FERC notification of its status as a holding company as required under FERC regulations implementing PUHCA 2005 and a request for exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. In June 2006, Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Electric received notice from FERC confirming their status as holding companies as required under FERC regulations implementing PUHCA 2005 and granting exempt status similar to that held under PUHCA 1935. As federal agencies continue to develop new rules to implement the Energy Policy Act, we expect additional impacts on Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries in the future. Guardian: In April 2006, we sold our one third interest in Guardian to an affiliate of Northern Border Partners, L.P. for approximately $38.5 million. The sale generated an after tax gain of approximately $1.7 million. Guardian owns an interstate natural gas pipeline from the Joliet, Illinois market hub to southeastern Wisconsin that is designed to serve the growing demand for natural gas in Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. Guardian Pipeline began commercial operation in early December 2002. We have committed to purchase 650,000 Dth (approximately 76 87% of the pipelines total capacity) per day of capacity on the pipeline over a long term contract that expires in December 2022. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments: Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Under SFAS 71, the actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense. The actions of our regulators may also require us to accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2007, we had $1,126.3 million in regulatory assets and $1,877.4 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow SFAS 71. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under SFAS 71, may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 158, changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant: 77 Pension Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $5.7 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.3 In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for these plans in accordance with SFAS 106. Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as chan ges in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes. The following chart reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant: OPEB Plans Impact on Reported Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.1 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years ($2.6) 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.0 Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2007 of approximately $4.2 billion included accrued utility revenues of $312.2 million as of Dec ember 31, 2007. Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance: We record deferred tax asset valuation allowances in accordance with SFAS 109. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had recorded $3.3 million and $3.4 million of valuation allowances primarily related to uncertainty of our ability to benefit from state loss carryforwards in the future. In June 2005, we re evaluated our state loss carryforwards in conjunction with our new PTF plants and concluded that it was more likely than not that we will be able to utilize certain tax benefits associated with state net operating losses that had been carried forward from prior years. As such, in 2006 and 2005 we reversed $5.8 million and $16.3 million of valuation allowances associated with the state tax net operating losses that have been carried forward to future years. The remaining state loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2008 and have been reduced by a valuation allowance. If we would conclude in a future period that it was more likely than not that some or all of the remaining state NOLs would be realized before expiration, GAAP would require that we reverse the related valuation allowance in that 78 period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported as an increase or decrease in income. ITEM 7A.
