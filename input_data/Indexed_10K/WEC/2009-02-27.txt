ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non utility energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries. Our utility energy segment, consisting of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies", and Edison Sault, is engaged primarily in the business of generating electricity and distributing electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric under our PTF strategy. CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We seek to increase stockholder value by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is PTF. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsins growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental performance. Our PTF strategy, which is discussed further below, is having and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our utility and non utility energy segments. In July 2005, the first of four new electric generating units under our PTF strategy was placed into service. The second unit was placed in service in May 2008. Construction on the remaining two units is underway with OC 1 scheduled to be placed in service by the end of 2009 and OC 2 scheduled to be placed in service in the fall of 2010. Utility Energy Segment: Our utility energy segment strives to provide reasonably priced energy delivered at high levels of customer service and reliability. We expect our prices to continue to be established by our regulatory bodies under traditional rate based, cost of service methodologies. We continue to gain efficiencies and improve the effectiveness of our service deliveries through the combined support operations of our electric and gas businesses. We work to obtain a reliable, reasonably priced supply of electricity through plants that we operate and various long term supply contracts. Non Utility Energy Segment: Our primary focus in this segment is to improve the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease new generation assets under our PTF strategy. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, we filed a petition with the PSCW that would allow us to begin implementing our 10 year PTF strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. PTF is intended to meet a growing demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under PTF, we are (1) investing approximately $2.6 billion in 2,120 MW of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrading our existing electric generating facilities; and (3) investing in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin Electric will lease each new generating facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the investments in We Powers new facilities over the initial lease term. At the end of the leases, Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. 41 Wisconsin Electric expects that payments under the plant leases will be recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law. Under our PTF strategy, we expect a significant portion of our future generation needs will be met through We Powers construction of the PWGS units and the Oak Creek expansion. As of December 31, 2008: We completed the construction of our two 545 MW natural gas fired intermediate load units in Port Washington, Wisconsin (PWGS 1 and PWGS 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Both units are fully operational and were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters. We have made significant progress on construction of the two 615 MW coal fired base load units (OC 1 and OC 2) adjacent to the site of our existing Oak Creek Power Plant in Oak Creek, Wisconsin (the Oak Creek expansion), with OC 1 scheduled to be in service in late 2009 and OC 2 in fall 2010. All environmental permits have been received. The WDNR issued a final modified WPDES Permit in July 2008. We completed the planned sale of approximately a 17% (200 MW) ownership interest in the Oak Creek expansion to two co owners. Through December 31, 2008, we have financed our PTF expenditures with internally generated cash, asset sales and debt financings. Future expenditures are expected to be financed with internally generated cash and debt financings. We currently do not plan to issue any new common equity as part of our PTF strategy. Our primary risks under PTF are construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for our Oak Creek expansion; changes in applicable laws or regulations; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws or regulations by the permitting agencies; the ability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner; obtaining the investment capital from outside sources necessary to implement the strategy; governmental actions; and events in the global economy. For further information concerning PTF capital requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. For additional information regarding risks associated with our PTF strategy, including a discussion of the claims submitted by Bechtel, the contractor for the Oak Creek expansion, and the regulatory process and specific regulatory approvals, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Sale of Point Beach: In September 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the buyer purchased Point Beach, its nuclear fuel and associated inventories and assumed the obligation to decommission the plant. Wisconsin Electric retained approximately $506 million of the sales proceeds, which represents the net book value of the assets sold and certain transaction costs. In addition, Wisconsin Electric deferred the net gain on the sale of approximately $418 million as a regulatory liability and deposited those proceeds into a restricted cash account. In connection with the sale, Wisconsin Electric also transferred $390 million of decommissioning funds to the buyer. Wisconsin Electric then liquidated the balance of the decommissioning trust assets and retained approximately $552 million, which was also placed into the restricted cash account. We are using the cash in the restricted cash account and the interest earned on the balance for the benefit of our customers and to pay certain taxes related to the liquidation of the qualified decommissioning trust. Our regulators are directing the manner in which these proceeds will benefit customers. For further information on the 2008 rate case, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we are paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered. For additional information on the sale of Point Beach, see Nuclear Operations under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. 42 Divestiture of Assets Our PTF strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily included non utility generation assets located outside of Wisconsin and a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio, as well as our manufacturing business. In addition, in 2001 we contributed our transmission assets to ATC and received cash proceeds of $119.8 million and an economic interest in ATC. Finally, in 2006 we concluded that it was in the best interests of customers and stockholders to sell Point Beach. In 2007, we sold Point Beach for approximately $924 million. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion from the divestiture of assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2008, 2007 and 2006: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $581.9 $586.0 $532.8 Non Utility Energy 89.3 47.4 43.1 Corporate and Other (10.6) (4.9) (7.4) Total Operating Income 660.6 628.5 568.5 Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliate 51.8 43.1 38.6 Other Income and Deductions, net 17.0 48.9 53.1 Interest Expense, net 153.7 167.6 172.7 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 575.7 552.9 487.5 Income Taxes 217.1 216.4 175.0 Income From Continuing Operations 358.6 336.5 312.5 Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 0.5 (0.9) 3.9 Net Income $359.1 $335.6 $316.4 Diluted Earnings Per Share Continuing Operation $3.03 $2.84 $2.64 Discontinued Operations 0.01 (0.01) 0.03 Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $3.04 $2.83 $2.67 Diluted Earnings Per Share An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results in 2008, 2007 and 2006 follow. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2008 vs. 2007: Our utility energy segment contributed $581.9 million of operating income during 2008 compared with $586.0 million of operating income during 2007. During 2008, we experienced less favorable weather in the summer months, which decreased electric sales. In addition, our fuel and purchased power costs increased primarily as a result of the power purchase agreement entered into upon the sale of Point Beach. Finally, our other operating and maintenance expenses were higher due primarily to increased regulatory amortizations allowed in rates. These items were largely offset by our rate increases and increased margin from gas sales due to colder weather. 43 2007 vs. 2006: Our utility energy segment contributed $586.0 million of operating income during 2007 compared with $532.8 million of operating income during 2006. During 2007, we experienced more favorable weather which increased electric and gas sales. In addition, we experienced an increase in retail sales as a result of customer growth and we reached a settlement regarding a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines. These items were partially offset by an increase in fuel and purchased power expenses. The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Utility Energy Segment 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,686.4 $2,705.7 $2,529.4 Gas 1,694.6 1,481.2 1,419.9 Other 43.5 37.9 29.7 Total Operating Revenues 4,424.5 4,224.8 3,979.0 Fuel and Purchased Power (a) 1,244.9 1,000.6 806.2 Cost of Gas Sold 1,221.3 1,052.7 1,018.3 Gross Margin 1,958.3 2,171.5 2,154.5 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance (a) 1,452.8 1,174.2 1,211.1 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization (a) 304.1 315.2 314.0 Property and Revenue Taxes 107.6 102.6 96.6 Total Operating Expenses 4,330.7 3,645.3 3,446.2 Amortization of Gain 488.1 6.5 Operating Income $581.9 $586.0 $532.8 (a) In September 2007, we sold Point Beach and commenced purchasing power from the new owner under a power purchase agreement. As a result of the sale and the power purchase agreement, our 2008 earnings reflect higher fuel and purchased power costs as compared to 2007. In addition, our 2008 operating income reflects lower other operation and maintenance costs and lower depreciation, decommissioning and amortization costs as we no longer own Point Beach. In January 2008, Wisconsin Electric received a rate order from the PSCW that authorized a 17.2% increase in electric rates to recover increased costs associated with transmission expenses, our PTF program, environmental expenditures, continued investment in renewable and efficiency programs and recovery of previously deferred regulatory assets. The PSCW allowed us to issue bill credits to our customers from the proceeds of the net gain and excess decommissioning funds associated with the sale of Point Beach to mitigate this increase. As a result of these bill credits, we estimate that the January 2008 PSCW rate order resulted in a net 3.2% increase in electric rates paid by our Wisconsin customers in 2008 and will result in another net increase of 3.2% in 2009. The bill credits that we issue to our customers and the proceeds immediately applied to regulatory assets are reflected on our income statement in the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. As we issue the bill credits, we transfe r the cash from a restricted account to an unrestricted account. The transferred cash is equal to the bill credits, less taxes. 44 Electric Utility Gross Margin The following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2008 with similar information for 2007 and 2006, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh Sales Electric Utility Operations 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $977.1 $929.6 $883.2 8,448.1 8,586.6 8,322.7 Small Commercial/Industrial 890.6 861.7 814.8 9,260.3 9,430.3 9,142.2 Large Commercial/Industrial 659.6 676.9 647.5 10,903.0 11,245.6 11,173.1 Other Retail 21.2 19.7 19.3 167.7 168.7 169.9 Total Retail Sales 2,548.5 2,487.9 2,364.8 28,779.1 29,431.2 28,807.9 Wholesale Other 58.9 95.1 78.0 2,281.1 2,178.5 2,057.6 Resale Utilities 37.5 81.6 51.2 881.0 1,434.5 1,025.7 Other Operating Revenues 41.5 41.1 35.4 Total $2,686.4 $2,705.7 $2,529.4 31,941.2 33,044.2 31,891.2 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 570.8 570.1 487.9 Purchased Power 660.6 419.7 309.8 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,231.4 989.8 797.7 Total Electric Gross Margin $1,455.0 $1,715.9 $1,731.7 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,677 Normal) 7,073 6,508 6,043 Cooling (719 Normal) 593 800 723 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. Electric Utility Revenues and Sales 2008 vs. 2007: Our electric utility operating revenues decreased by $19.3 million, or 0.7%, when compared to 2007. The largest factor in this decline was a one time $62.5 million FERC approved refund to our wholesale customers associated with their share of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Consistent with past practices, the refund was recorded as a reduction in wholesale revenues. Because the refund came from the restricted cash associated with the sale of Point Beach, a corresponding entry was made to amortize the gain on the sale of Point Beach. We also estimate that weather reduced our revenues by approximately $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared the same period in 2007. As measured by cooling degree days, 2008 was approximately 25.9% cooler than 2007 and 17.5% cooler than normal. Opportunity sales declined by approximately $44.1 million primarily because of less favorable weather, which reduced demand for our higher cost generation that was not being utilized to serve our retail customers. In addition, we experienced a $9.0 million decrease in revenue related to the settlement of a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines, that occurred in 2007. Partially offsetting these decreases, we estimate that our electric revenues were approximately $142.9 million higher than the same period in 2007 because of pricing increases we received in the January 2008 PSCW rate case, the interim April 2008 and final July 2008 PSCW fuel orders and a wholesale rate increase effective in May 2007. For more i nformation on the pricing increases and the fuel cost adjustment clause, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources. We estimate that sales to large commercial and industrial customers will decline in 2009 because of the current economic conditions. However, we expect our total electric utility operating revenues to increase in 2009 primarily due to the scheduled reduction of Point Beach bill credits, the full year impact of the 2008 rate increase and the impact of the one time refund to FERC wholesale customers in 2008. 45 2007 vs. 2006: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $176.3 million, or 7.0%, when compared to 2006. The biggest drivers of the increase in revenues related to the recognition of revenues attributable to fuel and purchased power of approximately $37.4 million and increased revenues related to Resale Utilities of approximately $30.4 million. Our policy for electric fuel revenues is to not recognize revenue for any currently billable amounts if it is probable that we will refund those amounts to customers. In 2006, we experienced lower than expected fuel and purchased power costs, and we established $37.4 million of reserves to reflect amounts that were refunded to customers. No such reserves were established in 2007 as we experienced higher fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in Resale Utilities reflects our ability to sell electricity into the MISO and PJM markets due to the increased availability of our baseload plants. In addition, we estimate that $27.1 million of the increase in operating revenues related to pricing increases. This increase primarily reflects rate increases received in late January 2006 that were in effect for the entire twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and a wholesale rate increase effective May 2007. We also estimate that $28.9 million of the increase was due to more favorable weather and $22.8 million relates to sales growth in residential and commercial sales. Finally, approximately $9.0 million of the increase relates to the settlement in the second quarter of 2007 of a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines. Our retail electric sales volume grew by approximately 2.2%. The increase in retail sales was driven by growth in residential and commercial sales and more favorable weather in 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. In 2007, heating degree days increased by approximately 7.7% compared to 2006, and cooling degree days increased by approximately 10.7%. Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 2008 vs. 2007: Our fuel and purchased power costs increased by $241.6 million, or approximately 24.4%, when compared to 2007. The largest factor related to this increase was the power purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of Point Beach, which increased costs by approximately $247.0 million. In addition, in connection with the January 2008 PSCW rate order, we recorded a $41.2 million one time amortization of deferred fuel costs in the first quarter of 2008. After adjusting for the Point Beach power purchase agreement and one time amortization of deferred fuel cost, fuel and purchased power costs decreased by approximately $46.6 million, or 4.7%. Cost increases resulting from higher natural gas prices, purchased energy and coal and related transportation prices were more than offset by lower costs resulting from reduced MWh sales during 2008 as compared to 2007. We expect that electric fuel and purchased power expenses in 2009 will be impacted by the price of natural gas, the increased cost of coal and related transportation prices and changes in electric sales. 2007 vs. 2006: Our fuel and purchased power expenses increased by $192.1 million, or approximately 24.1%, when compared to 2006. Our total electric sales volume increased by approximately 3.6%, when compared to 2006. However, our average fuel and purchased power costs increased by $4.86 per MWh, or approximately 20.6%. The largest factors for the higher cost per MWh are the power purchase agreement entered into in connection with the sale of Point Beach, which increased costs by approximately $47.0 million, increased coal and transportation costs, increased market prices for purchased energy and an increase in production of gas fired generation used for opportunity sales. Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2008, 2007 and 2006: 46 Gas Utility Operations 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,694.6 $1,481.2 $1,419.9 Cost of Gas Sold 1,221.3 1,052.7 1,018.3 Gross Margin $473.3 $428.5 $401.6 We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $299.5 $273.9 $255.0 841.8 791.7 727.9 Commercial/Industrial 109.3 93.4 86.0 503.2 461.9 435.9 Interruptible 2.4 2.0 2.0 23.0 22.7 21.3 Total Retail Gas Sales 411.2 369.3 343.0 1,368.0 1,276.3 1,185.1 Transported Gas 52.2 51.7 51.3 905.8 921.6 843.8 Other Operating 9.9 7.5 7.3 Total $473.3 $428.5 $401.6 2,273.8 2,197.9 2,028.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,677 Normal) 7,073 6,508 6,043 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a twenty year moving average. 2008 vs. 2007: Our gas margins increased by $44.8 million, or approximately 10.5%, when compared to 2007. We estimate that approximately $22.5 million of this increase related to pricing increases that we received in the January 2008 PSCW rate order. Additionally, we estimate that weather had a positive impact on our gas margin of approximately $13.9 million. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were 8.7% colder in 2008 as compared to 2007, and 5.9% colder than normal. We expect our gas margins in 2009 will be impacted by weather; however, as noted above, 2008 was colder than normal. 2007 vs. 2006: Our gas margins increased by $26.9 million, or 6.7%, between the comparative periods. We estimate that approximately $21.7 million of this increase related to increased sales as a result of more normal winter weather. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were approximately 7.7% colder in 2007 as compared to 2006. As a result, our retail therm deliveries increased approximately 7.7% from 2006. In addition, we estimate that our gas margins improved by $6.6 million due to a rate order that went into effect in the latter part of January 2006 and was effective for the entire twelve months ended December 31, 2007. 47 Other Operation and Maintenance Expense 2008 vs. 2007: Our other operation and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $278.6 million, or 23.7%, when compared to 2007. The January 2008 PSCW rate order allowed for pricing increases related to transmission costs, PTF lease costs and the amortization of other deferred costs. These items were $262.8 million higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition to these regulatory amortizations, in connection with the January 2008 PSCW rate order, we recorded a one time $43.8 million amortization of deferred bad debt costs in the first quarter of 2008. We also incurred approximately $64.1 million of increased expenses related to the operation and maintenance of our power plants and electric distribution system. These increased costs were also considered in the rate setting process. These increases were partially offset by a $119.7 million decrease in nuclear operation and maintenance expense related to Point Beach as we no longer own the plant. Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by wage inflation, employee benefit costs, plant outages and the amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2009 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease due to the impact of the $43.8 million one time amortization of deferred bad debt costs in 2008 and other overall cost reduction efforts implemented in response to the current economic recession. 2007 vs. 2006: Our other operation and maintenance expense decreased by $36.9 million, or 3.0%, when compared to 2006. This decrease was primarily because of a decline in nuclear operations expense of approximately $37.8 million because we owned Point Beach for only nine months in 2007 as compared to a full year in 2006. Additionally, fossil operations expense decreased by approximately $6.0 million due to fewer planned outages in 2007 as compared to 2006. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $12.7 million in regulatory amortizations as a result of the January 2006 rate order. The January 2006 rate order covered increased expenses related to transmission costs, bad debt costs and PTF costs. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expense 2008 vs. 2007: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense decreased by approximately $11.1 million, or 3.5%, when compared to 2007. The 2007 sale of Point Beach reduced depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense by approximately $24 million as we no longer own the plant. Partially offsetting this decline was higher depreciation related to new projects including the Blue Sky Green Field wind project that was placed in service in May 2008. We expect depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense to increase in 2009 as a result of an overall increase in utility plant in service. 2007 vs. 2006: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense increased by $1.2 million, or 0.4%, when compared to 2006. This increase was the result of increased depreciation for normal plant additions and coal related environmental controls that were placed in service in November 2006. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and decommissioning costs as a result of the sale of Point Beach in September 2007. Amortization of Gain In connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale of approximately $902.2 million to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits are being returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it is being amortized to the income statement as we issue bill credits or make refunds to customers. When the bill credits and refunds are issued to customers, we transfer cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. 48 During 2008 and 2007, the Amortization of Gain was as follows: Amortization of Gain 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Bill Credits Retail $340.6 $6.5 One Time FERC Refund 62.5 One Time Amortization to Offset Regulatory Asset 85.0 Total Amortization of Gain $488.1 $6.5 In 2009, we expect to see a reduction in the Amortization of Gain because of the one time entries identified above, as well as an expected approximately $100 million decrease in bill credits to retail customers compared to 2008. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME The most significant subsidiary included in this segment is We Power, which constructs and owns power plants associated with our PTF strategy and leases them to Wisconsin Electric. This segment primarily reflects revenues billed under the leases for PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and the Oak Creek coal handling system, and the related depreciation expense. The following table compares our non utility energy segments operating income during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Non Utility Energy Segment 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $126.2 $75.7 $69.1 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 14.6 15.9 14.4 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 21.9 12.1 11.2 Property and Revenue Taxes 0.4 0.3 0.4 Operating Income $89.3 $47.4 $43.1 Note: We Powers PTF lease revenues and Wisconsin Electrics lease costs are eliminated in consolidation. 2008 vs. 2007: Our non utility energy segment contributed $89.3 million of operating income in 2008 compared to operating income of $47.4 million in 2007. This increase was primarily related to lease income from PWGS 2, which was placed in service in May 2008, and the full year impact of the coal handling system for Oak Creek, which was placed in service in November 2007. In 2009, we expect our non utility energy segment to generate higher operating income as PWGS 2 will be in service for a full year. In addition, we will recognize lease income on the new water intake system for Oak Creek that was placed in service in January 2009, which supplies cooling water to the existing units at Oak Creek. 2007 vs. 2006: Our non utility energy segment contributed $47.4 million of operating income in 2007 compared to operating income of $43.1 million in 2006. This increase was primarily related to the Oak Creek coal handling system that was placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2007. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2008 vs. 2007: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2008 compared with an operating loss of $4.9 million in 2007. The increase in operating loss was primarily related to reduced real estate sales during 2008 as compared to 2007. In the foreseeable future, we expect to have slight operating losses as we have minimal business operations in this segment. 49 2007 vs. 2006: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $4.9 million in 2007 compared with an operating loss of $7.4 million in 2006. The favorable change was primarily related to our Wispark operations, which had operating income during 2007 as compared to operating losses throughout 2006. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET The following table identifies the components of consolidated other income and deductions, net during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Other Income and Deductions, net 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Carrying Costs $0.8 $28.8 $25.0 Gain on Property Sales 2.6 13.1 3.2 Gain on Sale of Guardian Investment 2.8 AFUDC Equity 7.8 5.2 14.6 Other, net 5.8 1.8 7.5 Total Other Income and Deductions, net $17.0 $48.9 $53.1 2008 vs. 2007: Other income and deductions, net decreased by $31.9 million when compared to 2007. In connection with the January 2008 PSCW rate order, we stopped accruing carrying charges on regulatory assets as we are now allowed a current return on them. Additionally, in 2007 we recognized approximately $13.1 million on property sales, most of which related to land sales in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, as compared to $2.6 million in 2008. During 2009 we expect to see an increase in Other Income and Deductions, net as we expect AFUDC Equity to increase for the Oak Creek AQCS project. 2007 vs. 2006: Other income and deductions, net decreased by $4.2 million when compared to 2006. The reduction primarily reflects a decrease in AFUDC of $9.4 million in connection with the environmental controls related to the new scrubber placed in service at our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant in the fourth quarter of 2006. This scrubber was installed as part of the implementation of our EPA consent decree. For further information on the consent decree with the EPA, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. This reduction was offset, in part, by an increase in gains on sales of property primarily associated with land sold in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest Expense, net 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Interest Costs $240.3 $240.9 $212.6 Less: Capitalized Interest 86.6 73.3 39.9 Interest Expense, net $153.7 $167.6 $172.7 2008 vs. 2007: Interest expense, net decreased by $13.9 million in 2008 when compared with 2007. Our gross interest costs decreased by $0.6 million because of lower short term interest rates that were offset in part by higher debt balances. Our capitalized interest increased $13.3 million, primarily because of increased construction in progress at our Oak Creek units. During 2009, we expect gross interest expense to increase due to increased debt levels to fund our planned construction activity; however, these increases are expected to be mitigated by increases in our capitalized interest. 50 2007 vs. 2006: Interest expense, net decreased by $5.1 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. Our gross interest costs increased by $28.3 million because of higher debt levels primarily related to our PTF construction program. However, our capitalized interest increased by $33.4 million due to higher levels of construction in progress at our PTF plants, which resulted in a reduction of our net interest expense. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 2008 vs. 2007: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 37.7% in 2008 compared to 39.2% in 2007. This reduction in our effective tax rate was the result of increases in the production tax deductions and wind credits. These items were considered by the PSCW in setting our rates in the January 2008 PSCW rate order; therefore, the lower effective tax rate did not have a significant impact on net income. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2009 annual effective tax rate to range between 35% and 37%. 2007 vs. 2006: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 39.2% in 2007 compared to 35.9% in 2006. In 2006, we reversed $5.8 million of valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carry forwards as we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize these benefits. Excluding these items, our 2006 effective tax rate was 37.1%. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The following table identifies the primary components of net income (loss) from discontinued operations during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Discontinued Operations 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Manufacturing $ $ $2.4 Non Utility and Other 0.5 (0.9) 1.5 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax $0.5 ($0.9) $3.9 Our 2008 and 2007 earnings from discontinued operations reflect resolution of tax liabilities. Our 2006 earnings from discontinued operations reflect a loss on the sale of Minergy Neenah LLC, the 2006 operations of the plant and income of approximately $2.4 million related to the favorable resolution of tax liabilities. See Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the transactions described above. 51 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2008, 2007 and 2006: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $737.0 $532.5 $730.0 Investing Activities ($906.9) ($543.2) ($939.5) Financing Activities $175.0 $1.1 $173.3 Operating Activities 2008 vs. 2007: Cash provided by operating activities was $737.0 million during 2008 which was $204.5 higher than 2007, primarily because of higher cash earnings and lower tax payments. During 2008, our cash earnings were higher than in 2007 because of increased amortizations of deferred costs associated with regulatory assets. During 2008, our cash taxes were $289.2 million lower than 2007, primarily because of additional tax depreciation, increased deductions for contributions to our pension plan and deferred taxes associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust assets. In accordance with IRS guidelines, we completed a review in 2008 and concluded that certain timing items that historically had been capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes could be deducted currently. In January 2009, we contributed $270 million to our qualified pension plan which resulted in a tax deduction for 2008. 2007 vs. 2006: Cash provided by operating activities was $532.5 million during 2007, which is $197.5 million lower than 2006. This decline was due primarily to higher tax payments, lower fuel recoveries and changes in working capital. In 2007, we paid approximately $108 million in cash taxes because of the Point Beach sale and the liquidation of the nuclear decommissioning trust. In addition, cash taxes from operating income were higher due to higher taxable income. Our cash from fuel collections was unfavorable in 2007 as compared to 2006 because in 2006 we over collected fuel and purchased power costs and in 2007 we under collected such costs. Investing Activities 2008 vs. 2007: Cash used in investing activities was $906.9 million during 2008, an increase of $363.7 million over 2007. This increase reflects a reduction in proceeds from asset sales, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash from the sale of Point Beach released to us. During 2008, we released $345.1 million of restricted cash. In September 2007, we sold Point Beach and received approximately $924 million and retained approximately $552 million of decommissioning funds. We placed approximately $924 million in restricted accounts to be used for the payment of taxes and for the benefit of our customers. We release the restricted cash, adjusted for taxes, as we issue bill credits to our customers, which is reflected as an amortization of the gain on our income statement. We expect to release approximately $214.1 million of restricted cash during 2009 as we issue fewer bill credits to our retail customers from the Point Beach proceeds pursuant to the terms of our 2008 rate order. During 2008, our capital expenditures decreased $74.4 million primarily due to reduced construction spending related to our PTF generation plants. This was partially offset by increased spending at Wisconsin Electric related to the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field wind project and the start of construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project. During 2009, we expect our capital expenditures to be lower than 2008 because we are nearing the completion of construction of the PTF generation plants. 2007 vs. 2006: Cash used in investing activities was $543.2 million during 2007, a reduction of $396.3 million over 2006. The two most significant factors related to cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures and the unrestricted proceeds we received from the sale of Point Beach. Our 2007 capital expenditures exceeded $1.2 billion, an increase of $282.8 million over 2006. This increase was expected and it primarily reflects the continued construction efforts with our PTF generation plants. 52 During 2007, we experienced a significant inflow of cash related to the sale of Point Beach; however, we restricted a significant amount of that cash as it will be used for the benefit of our customers. The 2007 cash flows related to the Point Beach sale are summarized as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Proceeds from the sale of Point Beach $924.1 Proceeds from the liquidation of decommissioning trusts 552.4 Total Proceeds 1,476.5 Less: Proceeds restricted for the benefit of customers, net of taxes and bill credits (731.6) Unrestricted cash to the Company $744.9 As the gain on the Point Beach sale is given back to customers, primarily in the form of bill credits, we release the restricted cash. The following table identifies capital expenditures by year: Capital Expenditures 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $607.4 $540.3 $459.9 We Power 529.3 667.3 466.1 Other 0.4 3.9 2.7 Total Capital Expenditures $1,137.1 $1,211.5 $928.7 Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Increase in Debt $316.8 $148.4 $299.7 Dividends on Common Stock (126.3) (116.9) (107.6) Common Stock, Net (11.4) (31.7) (21.2) Other (4.1) 1.3 2.4 Cash Provided by Financing $175.0 $1.1 $173.3 2008 vs. 2007: During 2008, cash provided by financing activities was $175.0 million compared to $1.1 million in 2007. During 2008, we issued a total of $966 million in long term debt and retired $350.8 million of long term debt. The net proceeds were used to repay short term debt. For additional information on the debt issues, see Note K Long Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our common stock dividends increased in 2008 as we raised our dividend rate by 8%. In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend. 2007 vs. 2006: During 2007, cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 million compared to $173.3 million in 2006. This decline occurred because we did not issue as much net new debt in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decline in the amount of net new debt is directly related to the unrestricted cash we received from the sale of Point Beach as discussed above. During 2007, we issued $500 million principal amount of Junior Notes and we used the net proceeds from these notes to pay down short term debt incurred to fund our PTF construction and for other working capital purposes. In December 2007, Wisconsin Electric retired $250 million of 3.50% Notes due December 1, 2007. 53 No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2008, 2007 or 2006. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 0.5 million shares at a cost of $23.0 million, 1.4 million shares at a cost of $67.8 million and 1.1 million shares at a cost of $48.0 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we received proceeds of $11.6 million, $36.1 million and $26.8 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligation under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among other things, called for us to sell certain assets and reduce our debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 58.5% at December 31, 2008 due primarily to these asset sales. Over the next several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly lower than prior years. For more information, see Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Capital Resources We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2009 primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. Beyond 2009, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by short term borrowings and the issuance of debt securities. During the second half of 2008, the global credit markets suffered a significant contraction, including the failure of some large financial institutions. As a result, interest rates on our short term and variable rate tax exempt debt increased during the second half of 2008, but have since stabilized. Despite the turmoil in the credit markets, Wisconsin Electric was able to remarket its $147 million tax exempt bonds in August 2008 and to issue in October 2008 $300 million of 6.00% Debentures due April 1, 2014 and in December 2008 $250 million of 6.25% Debentures due December 1, 2015. Also in December 2008, Wisconsin Energy borrowed $260 million under an eighteen month credit agreement. As indicated above, despite the recent turmoil in the global credit markets, we still currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash. Our short term interest rates have stabilized and currently are lower than they were during the second half of 2008. Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. An affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, provided approximately $80 million of commitments under our bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis. We have no current plans to replace Lehmans commitments. Excluding Lehmans commitments, as of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $1.6 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $602.3 million of short term debt outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. 54 We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities at December 31, 2008: Company Total Facility * Letters of Credit Credit Available * Facility Expiration Facility Term (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $857.5 $1.5 $856.0 April 2011 5 year Wisconsin Electric $476.4 $4.1 $472.3 March 2011 5 year Wisconsin Gas $285.8 $ $285.8 March 2011 5 year * Excludes Lehmans commitments Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval. In connection with the conversion of the interest rate determination method for certain Wisconsin Electric tax exempt bonds in August 2008, Wisconsin Electric terminated its $100 million six month bank back up credit facility that was scheduled to expire in September 2008. The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 2008 2007 Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,336.9 $3,586.9 $3,099.2 $3,349.2 Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,136.5 3,886.5 3,525.3 3,275.3 Short Term Debt 602.3 602.3 900.7 900.7 Total Capitalization $8,106.1 $8,106.1 $7,555.6 $7,555.6 Total Debt $4,738.8 $4,488.8 $4,426.0 $4,176.0 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 58.5% 55.4% 58.6% 55.3% Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure. As described in Note J Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. 55 Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by S&P, Moodys and Fitch as of December 31, 2008: S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Unsecured Senior Debt BBB+ A3 A Unsecured Junior Notes BBB Baa1 BBB+ Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Secured Senior Debt A Aa3 AA Unsecured Debt A A1 A+ Preferred Stock BBB A3 A Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A1 A+ Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt BBB+ A3 A In July 2008, S&P affirmed the corporate credit ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and changed the ratings outlooks assigned each company from stable to positive. On April 30, 2008, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and the stable ratings outlook of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. Fitch also revised the ratings outlook of Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from negative to stable. The security rating outlooks assigned by Moodys for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are all stable. Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 56 Capital Requirements Our estimated 2009, 2010 and 2011 capital expenditures are as follows: Capital Expenditures 2009 2010 2011 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $628 $754 $982 We Power 240 61 28 Other 7 4 Total $875 $819 $1,010 Due to changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segments, future long term capital requirements may vary from recent capital requirements. The expected decline in the We Power capital expenditures reflects the anticipated completion of the new Oak Creek units in 2010. The expected increase in the Utility capital expenditures is related to the AQCS project at Oak Creek that is projected to be completed in 2012 and the Glacier Hills Wind Park that is also expected to be completed by 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We have funded our pension obligations and certain other post retirement obligations in outside trusts. Collectively, these trusts had investments of approximately $878 million as of December 31, 2008. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. We have defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees. During 2008, we contributed $38.6 million to our qualified pension plan. As of December 31, 2008, the returns on our pension plan assets were significantly below our expected annual returns of 8.5%. In January 2009, we contributed $270 million to our qualified pension plan. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For further information see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For further information, see Note P Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have identified two tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties but have been unable to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of these two variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. Instead, we account for one of these contracts as a capital lease and for the other contract as an operating lease, and both are reflected in the Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments table below. A similar power purchase agreement expired during the second quarter of 2008. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 57 Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $7,204.1 $279.3 $1,145.8 $744.4 $5,034.6 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 403.8 34.9 73.7 79.3 215.9 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 97.8 23.6 41.6 20.0 12.6 Purchase Obligations (e) 15,350.3 1,430.6 1,990.9 1,092.4 10,836.4 Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 75.5 74.0 1.5 Total Contractual Obligations $23,131.5 $1,842.4 $3,253.5 $1,936.1 $16,099.5 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. Contracts with multiple unknown variables have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations). For the purpose of determining our contractual obligations and commercial commitments only, we assumed the Junior Notes would be retired in 2017 with the proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities pursuant to the terms of the RCC. (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for power purchase commitments. (d) Operating Lease Obligations for power purchase commitments and vehicle and rail car leases. (e) Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. This includes the power purchase agreement for all of the energy produced by Point Beach. (f) Other Long Term Liabilities includes the expected 2009 supplemental executive retirement plan obligation and the non discretionary pension contribution. For additional information on employer contributions to our benefit plans see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above does not include FIN 48 liabilities. For further information regarding FIN 48 liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. For a discussion of 2009, 2010 and 2011 estimated capital expenditures, see Capital Requirements above. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Large Construction Projects: In November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW super critical pulverized coal generating units adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including a target construction cost of the Oak Creek expansion of $2.191 billion, plus, subject to PSCW approval, cost over runs of up to 5%, costs attributable to force majeure events, excused events and event of loss provisions. For additional information, see Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion. 58 Large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, legal challenges, changes in applicable laws or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the courts or permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, other governmental actions and events in the global economy. See Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion below for a discussion of claims for schedule and cost relief submitted by Bechtel. If final costs of the Oak Creek expansion are within 5% of the target cost, and the additional costs are deemed to be prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs. Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extenuating circumstances, such as force majeure conditions. Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. SFAS 71 allows regulated entities to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. Under SFAS 71, we record these items as regulatory liabilities. Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range (plus or minus 2% for 2009) when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted prospectively. For information regarding the current fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for our gas utility operations through GCRMs, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. Natural Gas Costs: Significant volatility in the cost of natural gas affects our electric and gas utility operations. Although the cost of natural gas has decreased recently, natural gas costs have generally increased since 2003. We expect that demand for natural gas will remain high into the foreseeable future and that significant price relief will not occur until additional natural gas resources are developed. Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Because federal and state energy assistance dollars have not kept pace with rising natural gas costs over the recent year, our risks related to bad debt expenses have increased. In February 2005, the PSCW authorized the use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. In July 2008, we filed an application with the PSCW for a three year extension of use of the escrow method for bad debt costs. In December 59 2008, the PSCW approved a one year extension of use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through March 2010. As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. Weather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2008, 2007 and 2006, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations. Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2008 of our outstanding portfolio of $602.3 million of short term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.01% and $424.4 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 2.48%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $6.0 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $4.0 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return: We fund our pension and OPEB obligations through various trust funds, which in turn invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by changes in the market price of trust fund assets. We expect that the risk of expense and contribution variations as a result of changes in the market price of trust fund assets would be mitigated in part through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. At December 31, 2008, we held the following total trust fund assets at fair value, primarily consisting of publicly traded debt and equity security investments: Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $719.2 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $158.7 Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. Qualified external investment managers are engaged to manage the investments. Asset/liability studies are periodically conducted with the assistance of an outside investment advisor. The current study for the pension fund projects long term annualized returns of approximately 8.25%. Credit Ratings: We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment only in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payment required under these agreements totaled approximately $166.5 million. In addition, we have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties. Economic Conditions: We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy for our utility energy segment. Although the economy in our service territories has not been hit as hard as in other parts of the country, we are beginning to see an increase in unemployment and declines in industrial production demand. We expect the weakening economy to negatively impact our utility sales growth and bad debt levels. 60 Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. POWER THE FUTURE Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion by We Power. We Power will lease the new plants to Wisconsin Electric under long term leases, and we expect Wisconsin Electric to recover the lease payments in its electric rates. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units: Unit Name Scheduled In Service Authorized Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 (Actual) $ 333 million (Actual) PWGS 2 May 2008 (Actual) $ 331 million (Actual) OC 1 Late 2009 $ 1,300 million OC 2 Fall 2010 $ 640 million (a) Authorized cash costs represent the PSCW approved costs and the increases for factors such as inflation as identified in the PSCW approved lease terms and adjusted for our ownership percentages in the case of OC 1 and OC 2. The lease payments are based on the cash costs authorized by the PSCW. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the OC Units. The interest component of the return is determined up to 180 days prior to the date that the units are placed in service. Power the Future Port Washington Background: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting a CPCN for the construction of PWGS consisting of two 545 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. Wisconsin Gas completed construction of the natural gas lateral in December 2004. We Power completed construction of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 within the PSCW approved cost parameters and the units were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms. 61 Legal and Regulatory Matters: As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation). Under FERCs rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of PWGS 2 through a lease arrangement between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC for this asset transfer in December 2006. Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion Background: In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Oak Creek Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW coal fired units (the Oak Creek expansion) to be located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 is scheduled to be operational in late 2009 and OC 2 is scheduled to be operational in fall 2010. The Oak Creek Order concluded, among other things, that there was a need for additional electric generation for Southeastern Wisconsin and that a diversity of fuel sources best serves the interests of the State. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would not be included in lease payments or recovered from customers absent a finding by the PSCW of extenuating circumstances, su ch as force majeure conditions. The CPCN was granted contingent upon us obtaining the necessary environmental permits. All necessary permits have been received at this time. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site. In November 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest in the project to two unaffiliated entities, who will share ratably in the construction costs. The Oak Creek expansion includes a new coal handling system that will serve both the existing units at Oak Creek and OC 1 and OC 2. The new coal handling system was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2007 at a cost of approximately $175.0 million. A total of $24.1 million of additional costs related to the coal handling system were incurred during 2008. The most significant component of this additional cost was the rail cars that will supply coal to OC 1 and OC 2. The Oak Creek expansion also includes a new water intake system that will serve both the existing units at Oak Creek and OC 1 and OC 2. The new water intake system was placed into service in January 2009 at a cost of approximately $133.0 million. Lease Terms: In October 2004, the PSCW approved the lease generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power for the Oak Creek expansion. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Oak Creek Order, which do not include the key financial terms. Construction Status: In July 2008, Bechtel, the contractor of the Oak Creek expansion under a fixed price contract, notified us in a letter that it forecasts the in service date of unit 1 to be delayed three months beyond the guaranteed contract date of September 29, 2009. Bechtel also advised us in the letter that it forecasts the in service date of unit 2 to be one month earlier than the guaranteed contract date of September 29, 2010. According to the letter, reasons for the delay of unit 1 include severe winter weather experienced during the winters of 2006 2007 and 2007 2008, exacerbated by severe rain storms in April and June of 2008, changes in local labor conditions from those anticipated by Bechtel, the cumulative impact of a large number of change orders and delay in receiving FNTP in 2005 as a result of the court challenges by certain opposition groups to the CPCN for the Oak Creek expansion. Bechtel advised that they expected to submit a claim for cost and schedule relief associated with these issues by the end of 2008. 62 Based on Bechtels earlier communications, we notified Bechtel on September 29, 2008 that we were invoking the formal dispute resolution process provided in the contract in order to resolve certain issues related to the rights of the parties under the contract. We received Bechtels claims for schedule and cost relief on December 22, 2008. Bechtel continues to target an in service date for unit 1 three months beyond the guaranteed contract date of September 29, 2009, and an in service date for unit 2 one month earlier than the guaranteed contract date of September 29, 2010. However, Bechtel does request schedule relief that would result in six months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the guaranteed contract date for unit 1 and three months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the guaranteed contract date for unit 2. Bechtels first claim is based on the alleged impact of severe weather and certain labor related matters. Bechtel is requesting approximately $413 million in costs related to changed weather and labor conditions. Although Bechtel has reserved the right to request future additional costs and schedule relief, this amount includes $45 million of projected future costs in addition to those already incurred. The weather events for which Bechtel seeks cost and schedule relief are (i) extreme winds from September 2006 through April 2007, (ii) snowstorms from December 2007 through April 2008, and (iii) rain storms in June 2008. Bechtel contends that these weather events constituted events of force majeure. We will conduct a detailed analysis of Bechtels force majeure claim to determine whether Bechtel is entitled to any schedule relief as a result of these weather events. We believe Bechtels request for cost relief related to its claim of force majeure is without merit. Bechtel also claims that these same weather events constituted changed local conditions that it could not have reasonably foreseen and that caused it to incur additional costs. We believe that the claim for additional costs and schedule relief based on a change in local conditions is without merit. The alleged changes in labor conditions for which Bechtel seeks cost and schedule relief are (i) a significant shortage in the availability of craft labor, (ii) significant increases in competing projects, (iii) the overtime and per diems allegedly necessary to attract labor, and (iv) alleged restrictions that our Project Labor Agreement placed on Bechtels ability to attract and retain craft labor. Bechtel describes these as changed local conditions for which it believes we should bear the risk. Under the terms of the contract, we agreed to accept labor related risk only as to wage escalation in excess of 4% annually as measured by published wage bulletins. Therefore, we believe that this claim is without merit. Bechtels second claim of approximately $72 million seeks cost and schedule relief for the alleged effects of ERS directed changes and delays allegedly caused by ERS prior to the issuance of the FNTP in July 2005 as follows: (i) the delay in issuing certain limited notices to proceed; (ii) the delay in issuing the FNTP until the final resolution of litigation brought by certain opposition groups that challenged the CPCN for the Oak Creek expansion; (iii) the imposition of additional limits to third party cancellation charges which allegedly restricted Bechtels ability to issue purchase orders; (iv) the reduction of the pre FNTP monthly payments below the amounts required by the contract; and (v) the request by ERS to perform design studies and issue design changes during the pre FNTP period. We believe that this claim is without merit. We believe Bechtel was fully compensated for any and all impacts of the delayed start as indicated in certain change orders entered into between ERS and Bechtel prior to t he start of construction of the Oak Creek expansion. Further, we do not believe that the contract provides for relief based upon the cumulative impact of change orders. We continue to believe that the only circumstances and events for which we currently retain price adjustment risk under the contract are force majeure, wage escalation in excess of 4% annually as measured by published wage bulletins, delays caused by us, changes in scope or performance requested by us and unforeseen sub surface ground conditions. We are currently in the mediation phase with respect to determining the parties rights under the contract and Bechtels claims. We are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the claims. We estimate that for each month of delay of the in service date of unit 1 beyond September 29, 2009, earnings for 2009 would be reduced by $0.03 per share after tax compared to what they otherwise would have been. In addition, we estimate that for each month of acceleration of the in service date of unit 2 in advance of September 29, 2010, earnings for 2010 would increase by $0.02 per share after tax compared to what they otherwise would have been. WPDES Permit: In March 2007, on appeal, the Dane County Circuit Court affirmed in part an earlier decision by an ALJ in a contested case hearing, to uphold the WDNRs issuance of the WPDES permit. The Court also 63 remanded certain aspects of the ALJs decision for further consideration based on the January 2007 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that found certain portions of the federal rule concerning water intake systems for existing facilities (the Phase II Rule) impermissible and remanded several parts of the rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential rulemaking. In July 2007, the EPA formally suspended the Phase II rule in its entirety and directed states to use their "best professional judgment" in evaluating intake systems for existing facilities. In November 2007, the ALJ determined that the Oak Creek expansion units were new facilities under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The ALJ remanded the WPDES permit to the WDNR and directed the WDNR to reissue or modify the permit to reflect "best technology available" to comply with the standards applicable to new facilities under Wisconsin state law. In July 2008, the WDNR issued the final modified permit. The time period for any party to challenge the modified WPDES permit has expired. In July 2008, we and the other two joint owners of the Oak Creek expansion reached an agreement with Clean Wisconsin, Inc. and Sierra Club, the groups who were opposing the WPDES permit. Under the settlement agreement, these groups agreed to withdraw their opposition to the modified WPDES permit for the existing and expansion units at Oak Creek. In the agreement with Clean Wisconsin, Inc. and Sierra Club, we committed to contribute our share of $5 million (approximately $4.2 million) towards projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also agreed (i) for the 25 year period ending 2034, subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to contribute our share of up to $4 million per year (approximately $3.3 million) to fund projects to address Lake Michigan water quality, and (ii) subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to develop new solar and biomass generation projects. We also agreed to support state legislation to increase the renewable portfolio standard to 10 percent by 2013 and 25 percent by 2025, and to retire 116 MW of coal fired generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant. Other Regulatory Matters: As a result of the enactment of the Energy Policy Act, FERC, through an amendment to Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, has been given jurisdiction over the acquisition of generation (which includes leasing generation). Under FERCs rules implementing the Energy Policy Act, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power filed a joint application for FERC authorization to transfer the generating assets and limited interconnection facilities of OC 1 and OC 2 through a lease arrangement between We Power and Wisconsin Electric. We received approval from FERC on these leases in December 2006. UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 90% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 6% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. All of our natural gas, steam and water revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. The table below summarizes the anticipated annualized revenue impact of the recent Wisconsin Electric rate changes: 64 Incremental Annualized Percent Revenue Change Effective Service Wisconsin Electric Increase in Rates Date (Millions) Fuel electric, Michigan $5.4 4.0% January 1, 2009 Retail electric, Michigan $7.2 4.6% January 1, 2009 Fuel electric, Wisconsin $118.9 5.1% July 8, 2008 Retail electric, Wisconsin $389.1 17.2% January 17, 2008 Retail gas, Wisconsin $4.0 0.6% January 17, 2008 Retail steam, Wisconsin $3.6 11.2% January 17, 2008 Retail electric, Michigan $0.3 0.6% May 23, 2007 Fuel electric, Michigan $3.4 7.5% January 1, 2007 Retail electric, Wisconsin $222.0 10.6% January 26, 2006 Retail gas, Wisconsin $21.4 2.9% January 26, 2006 Retail steam, Wisconsin $7.8 31.5% January 26, 2006 Fuel electric, Michigan $2.7 5.9% January 1, 2006 2008 Pricing: During 2007, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings. Wisconsin Electric asked the PSCW to approve a comprehensive plan which would result in price increases of $648.6 million for its electric customers in Wisconsin. This price increase would be reduced by expected bill credits resulting from the sale of Point Beach. The initial rate filing estimated bill credits of $371.0 million in 2008 and $187.5 million in 2009, resulting in net pricing increases of 7.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested a 1.8% price increase in 2008 for its gas customers and an approximately 16.0% price increase in 2008 for all steam customers in metropolitan Milwaukee. Wisconsin Gas filed for a 4.1% price increase in 2008 for its gas customers. Electric pricing increases were needed to allow us to continue progress on previously approved initiatives, including: costs associated with our new PTF plants; recovery of costs associated with transmission; compliance with environmental regulations; continuation of investment in renewable and efficiency programs, including the Blue Sky Green Field wind project; and scheduled recovery of regulatory assets. On January 17, 2008, the PSCW approved pricing increases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas as follows: $389.1 million (17.2%) in electric rates for Wisconsin Electric the pricing increase will be offset by $315.9 million in bill credits in 2008 and $240.7 million in bill credits in 2009, resulting in a net increase of $73.2 million (3.2%) and $75.2 million (3.2%), respectively; $4.0 million (0.6%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Electric; $3.6 million (11.2%) for steam service from Wisconsin Electric; and $20.1 million (2.2%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Gas. In addition, the PSCW lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from 11.2% to 10.75%. The PSCW also determined that $85.0 million of the Point Beach proceeds should be immediately applied to offset certain regulatory assets. Wisconsin Electric expects to provide a total of approximately $710.0 million of bill credits to its Wisconsin customers over the three year period ending December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2008, we have issued approximately $296.4 million to Wisconsin retail customers. Michigan Price Increase: In January, 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the MPSC. This request represents an increase in electric rates of 14.7%, or $22.0 million, to support the growing demand for electricity, continued investment in renewable programs, compliance with environmental regulations, addition of distribution infrastructure and increased operational expenses. In November 2008, a settlement agreement with the MPSC staff and intervenors for a rate increase of $7.2 million, or 4.6%, was approved by the MPSC, effective January 1, 2009. 65 2006 Pricing: In January 2006, Wisconsin Electric received an order from the PSCW that allowed it to increase annual electric revenues by approximately $222.0 million, or 10.6%, to recover increased costs associated with investments in our PTF units, transmission services and fuel and purchased power, as well as costs associated with additional sources of renewable energy. The rate increase was based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%. The order also required Wisconsin Electric to refund to customers, with interest, any fuel revenues that it receives that are in excess of fuel and purchased power costs that it incurs, as defined by the Wisconsin fuel rules. The original order stipulated that any refund would also include interest at short term rates. This refund provision did not extend past December 31, 2006. During 2006, we experienced lower than expected fuel and purchased power costs. In September 2006, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to refund favorable fuel recoveries including accrued interest at a short term rate. In addition, in September 2006 the PSCW determined that if the total recoveries for 2006 exceeded $36 million, interest on the amount in excess of $36 million would be paid at the rate of 11.2%, our authorized return on equity rather than at short term rates as originally set forth in the order. During October 2006, we refunded $28.7 million, including interest, to Wisconsin retail customers as a credit on their bill and we received approval from the PSCW to refund an additional $10 million, including interest, in the first quarter of 2007. Our gas operations went through a traditional rate proceeding whereby the revenues were set to recover projected costs and to provide a return on rate base. The January 2006 order provided for increases in gas revenues totaling $60.1 million ($21.4 million, or 2.9%, for Wisconsin Electric gas operations and $38.7 million, or 3.7%, for Wisconsin Gas gas operations). The rate increases were based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2% for the gas operations of both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. The steam rate proceeding was a traditional rate proceeding. The January 2006 order provided for an increase in steam rates of $7.8 million, or 31.5%, to be phased in over a two year period beginning in 2006. The rate increase was based on an authorized return on equity of 11.2%. 2010 Pricing: We anticipate filing rate cases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas in the first half of 2009 for new rates effective in January 2010. Limited Rate Adjustment Requests 2008 Fuel Recovery Request: In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel costs was being driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas and the higher cost of transporting coal by rail as a result of increases in the cost of diesel fuel. On April 11, 2008, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $76.9 million (3.3%) in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. In July 2008, we received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $42.0 million in rate increases, for a total increase of $118.9 million (5.1%). Any over collection of fuel surcharge revenue in calendar year 2008 was subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.75%. During the first quarter of 2009, we expect to refund approximately $8.6 million, including interest, to Wisconsin retail customers related to the over collection of fuel costs in 20 08. Other Utility Rate Matters Oak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: As anticipated, in July 2008 we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We originally estimated the cost of this project to be $830 million, including AFUDC ($750 million excluding AFUDC). We now expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $885 million, including AFUDC ($800 million excluding AFUDC). The cost increase is primarily attributable to increases in material prices that occurred prior to the commencement of construction and material procurement activities in July 2008. The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA. The Citize ns Utility Board and Clean Wisconsin Inc., the two groups that opposed controlling Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, petitioned the PSCW for rehearing and reconsideration of its order. The PSCW denied their request and the petitioners did not appeal the PSCWs decision. 66 Michigan Legislation: During October 2008, Michigan enacted legislation to make significant changes in regulatory procedures, which should provide for more timely cost recovery. Public Act 286 allows the use of a forward looking test year in rate cases rather than historical data, and allows us to put interim rates into effect six months after filing a complete case. Rate filings for which an order is not issued within 12 months are deemed approved. In addition, we could seek a CPCN for new investment, and could recover interest on the investment during construction. Public Act 286 also gives the MPSC expanded authority over proposed mergers and acquisitions, and requires action within 180 days of filing. In addition, Public Act 295 calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard of 10% by 2015, and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards, and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: Within the state of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Embedded within its base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules, no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a band of the costs embedded in current rates for the twelve month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs are expected to fall outside of the band, and actual costs fall outside of established fuel bands, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. In June 2006, the PSCW opened a docket (01 AC 224) to consider revisions to the existing fuel rules (Chapter PSC 116). Public comments from stakeholders, including regulated utilities, were received by the PSCW. In July 2008, the PSCW ordered a second comment period on a revised rule, and hearings were held in August 2008. The current version of the revised rule recommends modifications to allow for annual plan and reconciliation filings of fuel costs by each regulated utility. In the period between plan and reconciliation, escrow accounting would be used to record fuel costs outside a plus or minus 2% annual band of the total fuel costs allowed in rates. The proposed rule further recommends that the escrow balance be trued up annually following the end of each calendar year. The earliest that we expect any possible action on the fuel rules is the summer of 2009. Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electrics operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a dollar for dollar basis. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we defer transmission costs that exceed amounts embedded in our rates. We are allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2008, we have deferred $199 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The January 2008 rate order provided for the recovery of these costs over six years beginn ing in January 2008; and the escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. There is an incentive mechanism under the GCRMs which allows for increased revenues if we acquire gas lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW. During 2008, approximately $2.6 million of additional revenues were earned. During 2007 and 2006, no additional revenues were earned under the incentive portion of the GCRMs. Bad Debt Costs: In January 2006, the PSCW issued an order approving the amortization over the next five years of bad debts deferred in 2004 for our gas operations. The bad debts deferred in 2004 related to electric operations will be considered for recovery in future rates, subject to audit and approval of the PSCW. In March 2005, the PSCW approved our use of escrow accounting for residential bad debt costs. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As a result of this approval from the PSCW, which extends through March 2009, we escrowed approximately $8.1 million, $8.9 million and $3.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to bad debt costs. In July 2008, we filed an application with the PSCW for a three year extension of use of the escrow 67 method for bad debt costs. In December 2008, the PSCW approved a year extension for the use of escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through March 2010. MISO Energy Markets: The PSCW approved deferral treatment for our costs related to the implementation of the MISO Energy Markets. Amounts deferred through December 31, 2007 are being recovered in rates. For additional information, see Industry Restructuring and Competition Electric Transmission and Energy Markets. Coal Generation Forced Outage 2007: In March 2007, we requested and received approval from the PSCW to defer as a regulatory asset approximately $13.2 million related to replacement power costs due to a forced outage of Unit 1 at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. The outage extended from February 2007 through March 2007. These costs were recovered as part of the $85 million one time recovery using Point Beach proceeds pursuant to the 2008 rate order in a write off during the first quarter of 2008. Wholesale Electric Pricing: In August 2006, Wisconsin Electric filed a wholesale rate case with FERC. The filing requested an annual increase in rates of approximately $16.7 million applicable to four existing wholesale electric customers. This includes a mechanism for fuel and other cost adjustments. In November 2006, FERC approved the rate filing subject to refund with interest. Three of the existing customers rates were effective in January 2007. The remaining wholesale customers rates were effective in May 2007. FERC approved a settlement of the rate filing in September 2007. In August 2008, we issued a one time $62.5 million refund to our wholesale customers pursuant to a FERC approved settlement related to the sale of Point Beach. Depreciation Rates: Periodically, we engage consultants to perform depreciation studies on our utility assets to determine our depreciation rates. In 2008, a consultant completed a depreciation study that concluded that we should reduce our utility depreciation rates because of longer asset lives and increased salvage values. The consultant estimated that the new proposed rates would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. In January 2009, we filed the depreciation study with the PSCW. If the PSCW approves the depreciation study, we would expect to implement the new depreciation rates in late 2009. We do not expect the new depreciation rates to have a material impact on earnings because we anticipate that the new depreciation rates will be considered when the PSCW sets our 2010 electric and gas prices. For information on our current depreciation rates, see Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Conso lidated Financial Statements. Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Act 141 provides that for the years 2006 2009, Wisconsin Electric may not decrease its renewable energy percentage, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Assuming the bulk of additional renewables is wind generation, Wisconsin Electric must obtain approximately 362 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2012 and another approximately 300 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2015 to meet the requirements of Act 141. We have already started development of additional sources of renewable energy which will assist us in complying with Act 141. See Wind Generation discussion below. In 2008, the Governor of Wisconsin established the Governors Task Force on Global Warming. The Task Force issued its final report in July 2008 that includes an increased renewable portfolio standard. Pursuant to the Task Forces recommendations, the renewable portfolio standard would increase to 10% by 2013, 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025. The legislature is expected to review these recommendations in 2009. Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. The previous law did not include similar provisions. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not 68 be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels. Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the DOA back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 requires that 1.2% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs. The Governor of Wisconsins Task Force on Global Warming recommended in July 2008 that this amount be increased to approximately 4%. It is not known at this time if that recommendation will be implemented. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective. Wind Generation: In June 2005, we purchased the development rights to a wind farm project (Blue Sky Green Field) from Navitas Energy, Inc. We began construction in June 2007 and the project reached commercial operation in May 2008. Land restoration, road repairs and other post construction activities are near completion. The cost of this project was approximately $301.7 million, including AFUDC, as of December 31, 2008. In addition, in October 2007 we provided notice to FPL Energy, a subsidiary of FPL, that we were exercising the option we received in connection with the sale of Point Beach to purchase all rights to a new wind farm site in central Wisconsin, Glacier Hills Wind Park. In July 2008, the purchase was completed and in October 2008, we filed a request for a CPCN with the PSCW for the Glacier Hills Wind Park. We currently expect to install wind turbines with approximately 132 to 207 MW of generating capacity, subject to the final site configuration and the turbine equipment selected. We expect 2012 to be the first full year of operation, subject to regulatory approvals and turbine availability. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy. We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2008 and 2007. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2009. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures as we have in past years. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation challenges related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to (1) air emissions such as CO2, SO2, NOx, small 69 particulates and mercury, (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash and (3) remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites. We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental issues including (1) improving our overall energy portfolio by adding more efficient generation as part of our PTF strategy, (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, (3) reviewing water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water requirements, (4) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules, (5) entering into agreement with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013, (6) evaluating and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems, (7) continuing the beneficial re use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units and (8) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA Consent Decree is estimated to be approximately $1.2 bi llion over the 10 years ending 2013. These costs are principally associated with the installation of air quality controls on Pleasant Prairie Units 1 and 2 and Oak Creek Units 5 8. In June 2007, we submitted an application to the PSCW requesting approval to construct environmental controls at Oak Creek Units 5 8 by 2012 as required by the Consent Decree. We expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $885 million, including AFUDC. Through December 31, 2008, we have spent approximately $506.7 million associated with implementing the EPA Consent Decree. For further information concerning the Consent Decree, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. National Ambient Air Quality Standards: In 2000 and 2001, Michigan and Wisconsin finalized state rules implementing phased emission reductions required to meet the NAAQS for 1 hour ozone. In 2004, the EPA began implementing NAAQS for 8 hour ozone and PM2.5. In December 2006, the EPA further revised the PM2.5 standard, and in March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard. 8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. States were required to develop and submit SIPs to the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intended to comply with the 8 hour ozone NAAQS. Instead of submitting a SIP, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate all counties in southeastern Wisconsin to be in attainment with the standard. In addition to the request for redesignation, Wisconsin also adopted the RACT rule that applies to emissions from our power plants in the affected areas of Wisconsin. We believe compliance with the NOx emission reduction requirements under the Consent Decree will substantially mitigate costs to comply with the RACT rule. In March 2008, the EPA issued a determination that the state of Wisconsin had failed to submit a SIP. We do not anticipate any further requirements to reduce emissions as a result of this finding, but we are unable to predict that outcome until Wisconsin responds to this finding (expected in July 2009) and the EPA subsequently takes a final approval action. In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour standard. Although additional counties may be designated as non attainment areas under the revised standard, until those designations become final and until any potential additional rules are adopted, we are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities. PM2.5 Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated PM2.5 non attainment areas in the country. All counties in Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard became effective; however, on February 24, 2009 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. The courts decision will likely result in an even more stringent annual PM2.5 standard. Until such time as the EPA revises the standard consistent with the courts decision and the states develop rules and submit SIPs to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with the standard, we are unable to predict the impact of this more restrictive standard on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities or our new PTF generating units being leased by Wisconsin Elec tric including OC 1, OC 2 and PWGS. Clean Air Interstate Rule: The EPA issued the final CAIR in March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8 hour ozone and PM2.5 standards by addressing the regional transport of SO2 and NOx. CAIR required NOx and SO2 emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28 state region within the eastern United States. Wisconsin and Michigan are affected states under CAIR. CAIR was to be implemented in two phases. Overall, CAIR is expected to result in a 70% reduction in SO2 emissions and a 65% reduction in NOx emissions from 2002 emission levels. A final CAIR rule was adopted in Wisconsin and Michigan. Subsequently, in 70 July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated CAIR and determined that the EPA must promulgate a rule consistent with its decision, but did not issue a mandate that would put its ruling into effect. In December 2008, the Court remanded CAIR to the EPA, but did not vacate it. Therefore, CAIR will remain in place while the EPA drafts a replacement rule. The Courts decision did not include a deadline for the replacement rule. We previously determined that compliance with the NOx and SO2 emission reductions requirements under the Consent Decree would substantially mitigate costs to comply with CAIR and will achieve the levels necessary under at least the first phase of CAIR. It will be necessary to see what the revised rule contains before we can determine if any additional reductions will be required. Clean Air Mercury Rule: The EPA issued the final CAMR in March 2005, following the agencys 2000 regulatory determination that utility mercury emissions should be regulated. CAMR would limit mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and cap utility mercury emissions in two phases, applicable in 2010 and 2018. The caps would limit emissions at approximately 20% and ultimately 70% below current utility mercury levels. The federal rule was challenged by a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated CAMR and sent the rule back to the EPA for re consideration. The D.C. Circuit denied a request for a rehearing and the parties subsequently petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the D.C. Circuits decision. In February 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for certiorari. In December 2008, a number of environmental groups also filed a complaint with the D.C. Circuit asking that the court place the EPA on a schedule for promulgating Maximum Achievable Control Technology limits for electric utilities. This latest complaint is still being processed by the D.C. Circuit. In October 2004, the WDNR issued mercury emission control rules that affect electric utilities in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin rules explicitly recognize an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal program and require that the WDNR must adopt state rule changes within 18 months of publication of any federal rules. In March 2007, the WDNR proposed changes to this rule to include an implementation plan for CAMR, along with a proposal for more stringent state only rules. WDNR did not take any final action on the March 2007 rule proposal. In March 2008, the WDNR once again proposed changes to the existing state only mercury rule. In June 2008, the Natural Resources Board approved the proposed rule. The rule was approved and went into effect in December 2008. The new rule requires 90% mercury emission reductions from utilities by 2015, or, under a multi emission option, 70% reductions by 2015, 80% by 2018 and 90% by 2021, provided utilities meet stringent NOx and SO2 emission reduction requirements by 2015. The rule eliminates the 2008 2009 emission cap, but retains the 40% emission reduction requirement for the period 2010 2014. Our plan is to maximize mercury reductions from our initial emission control investments. Enhanced mercury reductions from refinements to SO2 and NOx controls are expected to be developed over the next several years. Because control technology is under development, it is difficult to estimate what the cost will be to comply with the Wisconsin requirements . We believe the range of possible expenditures could be approximately $50 million to $200 million. As of January 2008, the MDEQ has also proposed a rule to both implement CAMR and impose state only requirements for achieving 90% emission reductions in 2015. The MDEQ has revised the draft rule to remove the requirements related to the now vacated CAMR, but is proceeding with the remainder of the state only rule. As part of a new technology demonstration which we undertook in partnership with the DOE, technology for the control of mercury has been installed at our Presque Isle Power Plant. We plan to continue the operation of that equipment beyond the test period. We anticipate that this equipment will be sufficient to comply with reductions that would be required under the state only rule. Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued CAVR in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines BART requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. Under CAVR, states are required to identify certain industrial facilities and power plants that affect visibility in the nations 156 Class I protected areas. States are then required to determine the types of emission controls that those facilities must use to control their emissions. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include particulate matter or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. States were required to submit SIPs to implement CAVR to the EPA by December 2007. Wisconsin has not yet submitted a SIP. Michigan submitted a SIP, which was partially approved. The reductions associate d with the state plans are scheduled to begin to take effect in 2014, with full implementation before 2018. In response to a citizen suit, in January 2009, the EPA issued a finding of 71 failure to 37 states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, regarding their failure to submit SIPs. The finding starts a two year window for the EPA to issue Federal Implementation Plans, unless a state submits and receives SIP approval. Failure to submit an approved SIP does not initiate any federal sanctions against the states. Wisconsin and Michigan have completed the BART rules, which cover one aspect of CAVR regulations. Wisconsin BART rules became effective July 2008 and Michigan BART rules became effective in September 2008. Both Wisconsin and Michigan BART rules are based, in part, on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. Therefore, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until the EPA completes a new CAIR rule. Clean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the CWA requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impact. This law dates back to 1972; however, prior to September 2004, there were no federal rules that defined precisely how states and EPA regions determined that an existing intake met BTA requirements. The Phase II rule established, for the first time, national performance standards and compliance alternatives for existing facilities that are designed to minimize the potential adverse environmental impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the 316(b) rules for Wisconsin Electrics Oak Creek Power Plant, We Powers Oak Creek expansion and PWGS were included in project costs. In January 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision concerning the Phase II rule for existing facilities (Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 04 6692 ag(L) (2d Cir. 2007)). The Second Circuit found certain portions of the rule impermissible and remanded several parts of the Phase II rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. Consistent with its announcement in March, in July 2007, the EPA formally suspended the Phase II rule in its entirety and directed states to use their "best professional judgment" in evaluating intake systems. We will work with the relevant state agencies as permits for our facilities come due for renewal to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken. Until the EPA completes its reconsideration and rulemaking, we cannot predict what impact these changes to the federal rules may have on our facilities. For additional information on this matter related to the Oak Creek expansion, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion in this report. EPA Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: In July 2008, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on a large array of possible regulatory actions it is contemplating under the federal CAA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed rules impact virtually all aspects of the economy including electric and natural gas utilities. The EPA document follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year requiring the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA if it finds that they endanger public health or welfare. The document seeks comment on whether the EPA should make that finding and, if so, the types of regulations it should adopt. The comment period has closed, and there has been no additional formal activity in the rule process. We cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, such a finding would have on us. Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. EPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric and the EPA announced that a Consent Decree had been reached that resolved all issues related to a request for information that had been issued by the EPA. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Greenhouse Gases: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support a voluntary approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. 72 Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including: Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units. Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that will be the most thermally efficient coal units in our system. Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation. Additional renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow&reg; renewable energy program. Retirement of Coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions continue to be considered in the U.S. Congress, and the new President and his administration have made it clear that they are focused on reducing CO2 emissions. Although the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined at this time, mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. LEGAL MATTERS Arbitration Proceedings: In May 2007, we reached a settlement with our largest electric customers, two iron ore mines, that operate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The mines represent approximately 6.5% of our 2008 electric sales; however, they provide a much smaller percentage of earnings. The mines had special negotiated contracts that expired in December 2007. The contracts had price caps for approximately 80% of the energy sales. We did not recognize revenue on amounts billed that exceeded the price caps. The incremental power costs in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan are now determined by MISO. In April 2005, we began to bill the mines the incremental power costs as quantified by the MISO Energy Markets. The mines notified us that they were disputing these billings and a portion of these disputed amounts were deposited in escrow. In September 2005, the mines notified us that they filed for formal arbitration related to the contracts. We notified the mines that we believe that they failed to comply with certain notification provisions related to annual production as specified within the contracts. In May 2007, Wisconsin Electric entered into a settlement agreement with the mines. The settlement was a full and complete resolution of all claims and disputes between the parties for electric service rendered by Wisconsin Electric under the power purchase agreements through March 31, 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, the mines paid Wisconsin Electric approximately $9.0 million and Wisconsin Electric released to the mines all funds held in escrow. The estimated earnings impact of the payment from the mines was $0.04 per share, which was recorded in 2007. The settlement also provided a mutually satisfactory pricing structure through the power purchase agreement expiration date of December 31, 2007. Beginning in January 2008, the mines began receiving electric service from Wisconsin Electric in accordance with tariffs approved by the MPSC. Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services. In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage, and, more recently, ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of this case, claims 73 by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. We do not believe the lawsuit has merit and we will vigorously defend the case. This lawsuit against Wisconsin Electric is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. In June 2007, a stray voltage lawsuit filed against Wisconsin Electric in May 2005 was settled. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric previously owned two electric generating units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. During 2007 and 2006 Point Beach provided approximately 17.3% and 25.3% respectively, of our net electric energy supply. On September 28, 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the buyer purchased Point Beach, its nuclear fuel and associated inventories and assumed the obligation to decommission the plant. Wisconsin Electric retained approximately $506 million of the sales proceeds, which represents the net book value of the assets sold and certain transaction costs. In addition, Wisconsin Electric deferred the net gain on the sale of approximately $418 million as a regulatory liability and deposited those proceeds into a restricted cash account. In connection with the sale, Wisconsin Electric also transferred $390 million of decommissioning funds to the buyer. Wisconsin Electric then liquidated the balance of the decommissioning trust assets and retained approximately $552 million, which was also placed into the restricted cash account. We are using the cash in the restricted cash account and the interest earned on the balance for the benefit of our customers and to pay certain taxes. Our regulators are directing the manner in which these proceeds will benefit customers. For further information on the 2008 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters in this report. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we are paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule that is established in the agreement. Under the agreement, if our credit rating and the credit rating of Wisconsin Electric from either S&P or Moodys fall below investment grade, or if the holders of any indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million accelerate or have the right to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness as a result of a default, we would need to provide collateral in the amount of $100.0 million (escalating at 3% per year commencing in 2024). Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the NRC in December 2005. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach. In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary 74 judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. We anticipate a decision during 2009. Wisconsin Electric incurred substantial damages prior to the sale of Point Beach and we are seeking recovery of our damages in this lawsuit, and we expect that any recoveries would be considered in setting future rates. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. The Energy Policy Act, which included tax subsidies for electric utilities, amended federal energy laws and provided FERC with new oversight responsibilities, continues to significantly impact the electric utility indus try. We continue to focus on infrastructure issues through our PTF growth strategy. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years. These issues include: Addition of new generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state; and Addition of renewable generation. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of two general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Electric Transmission and Energy Markets In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by LSEs located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. In February 2008, FERC issued several orders confirming that the current transmission cost allocation methodology is just and reasonable and should continue in the future. These orders are subject to rehearings or appeals. In April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of RSG charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. MISO 75 commenced with the resettlement of the market in accordance with the orders in July 2007. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints. In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC. In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling orders the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numer ous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved. Based on our analysis of the FERC decision and MISOs proposed implementation of FERCs ruling, we estimate that there could be a refund to us of up to $15 million. Due to the uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of the RSG cost allocation, we have not reflected the potential impact of this potential resettlement on our financial statements as of December 31, 2008. As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should adequately mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. MISO has developed a market for two ancillary services, regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In February 2007, MISO filed tariff revisions to include ancillary services. The MISO ancillary services market began in January 2009. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market is expected to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market is also expected to enable MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements. 76 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments: Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. Under SFAS 71, the actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense. The actions of our regulators may also require us to accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1,343.6 million in regulatory assets and $1,395.3 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow SFAS 71. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under SFAS 71, may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of SFAS 71 and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following SFAS 71. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 158, changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant: Pension Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $6.0 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.0 In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We account for these plans in accordance with SFAS 106. Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics 77 (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted SFAS 106 for rate making purposes. The following chart reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant: OPEB Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $1.9 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years ($2.3) 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $0.8 Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2008 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of, $341.2 million as of De cember 31, 2008. ITEM 7A.
