ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non utility energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries. Our utility energy segment, primarily consists of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies". We generate and distribute electricity in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we distribute natural gas in Wisconsin. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric under our PTF strategy. CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We seek to increase shareholder value by leveraging on our core competencies. Our key corporate strategy, announced in September 2000, is PTF. This strategy is designed to address Wisconsins growing electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in the state while maintaining a fuel diverse, reasonably priced electric supply. It is also designed to improve the delivery of energy within our distribution systems to meet increasing customer demands and to support our commitment to improved environmental performance. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, two 545 MW natural gas electric generating units, were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively, and OC 1, a 615 MW coal fired generating unit, was placed in service on February 2, 2010. Although the new guaranteed in service date is November 28, 2010, our contractor, Bechtel, is currently targeting commercial operation of OC 2, another 615 MW coal fired generating unit, by the end of August 2010. We have an undivided ownership interest in 515 MW of each of OC 1 and OC 2. We sold an approximately 17%, or 100 MW, ownership interest in each of OC 1 and OC 2 to two co owners. Utility Energy Segment: Our utility energy segment strives to provide reasonably priced energy delivered at high levels of customer service and reliability. We expect our prices to continue to be established by our regulatory bodies under traditional rate base, cost of service methodologies. We continue to gain efficiencies and improve the effectiveness of our service deliveries through the combined support operations of our electric and gas businesses. We work to obtain a reliable, reasonably priced supply of electricity through plants that we operate and various long term supply contracts. Non Utility Energy Segment: Our primary focus in this segment is to improve the supply of electric generation in Wisconsin. We Power was formed to design, construct, own and lease to Wisconsin Electric new generation assets under our PTF strategy. Power the Future Strategy: In February 2001, we filed a petition with the PSCW that would allow us to begin implementing our 10 year PTF strategy to improve the supply and reliability of electricity in Wisconsin. PTF is intended to meet the demand for electricity and ensure a diverse fuel mix while keeping electricity prices reasonable. Under PTF, we are (1) investing approximately $2.7 billion in 2,120 MW of new natural gas fired and coal fired generating capacity at existing sites; (2) upgrading our existing electric generating facilities; and (3) investing in upgrades of our existing energy distribution system. In November 2001, we created We Power to design, construct, own and lease the new generating capacity. Wisconsin Electric will lease each new generating facility from We Power as well as operate and maintain the new plants under 25 to 30 year lease agreements approved by the PSCW. Based upon the structure of the leases, we expect to recover the investments in We Powers new facilities over the initial lease term. At the end of the leases, 40 Wisconsin Electric will have the right to acquire the plants outright at market value or to renew the leases. Wisconsin Electric expects that payments under the plant leases will be recoverable in rates under the provisions of the Wisconsin Leased Generation Law. We expect a significant portion of our future generation needs will be met through We Powers construction of the PWGS units and the Oak Creek expansion. We have financed the construction of the PTF units with internally generated cash, asset sales and short term borrowings. When the plants are placed into service, we issue long term debt and use the net proceeds to repay the short term borrowings. We currently do not plan to issue any new common equity as part of our PTF strategy. The primary risks that remain under PTF are construction risks associated with the schedule and costs for OC 2; changes in applicable laws or regulations; adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws or regulations by the permitting agencies; the ability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner; obtaining the investment capital from outside sources necessary to implement the strategy; governmental actions; and events in the global economy. For further information concerning PTF capital requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. For additional information regarding risks associated with our PTF strategy, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Sale of Point Beach: In September 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. Pursuant to the terms of the sale agreement, the buyer purchased Point Beach, its nuclear fuel and associated inventories and assumed the obligation to decommission the plant. Wisconsin Electric retained approximately $506 million of the sales proceeds, which represents the net book value of the assets sold and certain transaction costs. Wisconsin Electric deferred the net gain on the sale of approximately $418 million as a regulatory liability and deposited those proceeds into a restricted cash account. In connection with the sale, Wisconsin Electric also transferred $390 million of decommissioning funds to the buyer. Wisconsin Electric then liquidated the balance of the decommissioning trust assets and retained approximately $552 million, which was also placed into the restricted cash account. At the direction of our r egulators, we are using the cash in the restricted cash account and the interest earned on the balance for the benefit of our customers and to pay certain taxes related to the liquidation of the qualified decommissioning trust. For further information on the 2008 and 2010 rate cases, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources in this report. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we are paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered. Divestiture of Assets Our PTF strategy led to a decision to divest non core businesses. These non core businesses primarily included non utility generation assets located outside of Wisconsin, a substantial amount of Wisparks real estate portfolio and our manufacturing business. In addition, in 2001 we contributed our transmission assets to ATC and received cash proceeds of $119.8 million and an economic interest in ATC. In 2007, we sold Point Beach for approximately $924 million. Since 2000, we have received total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion from the divestiture of assets. 41 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2009, 2008 and 2007: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $554.3 $580.5 $584.7 Non Utility Energy 120.1 89.3 47.4 Corporate and Other (10.7) (10.6) (4.9) Total Operating Income 663.7 659.2 627.2 Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliate 59.1 51.8 43.1 Other Income and Deductions, net 28.4 17.0 48.9 Interest Expense, net 156.7 153.7 167.6 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 594.5 574.3 551.6 Income Taxes 217.3 216.5 215.9 Income From Continuing Operations 377.2 357.8 335.7 Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 5.2 1.3 (0.1) Net Income $382.4 $359.1 $335.6 Diluted Earnings Per Share Continuing Operation $3.20 $3.03 $2.83 Discontinued Operations 0.04 0.01 Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $3.24 $3.04 $2.83 An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results follow. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2009 vs. 2008: Our utility energy segment contributed $554.3 million of operating income during 2009 compared with $580.5 million of operating income during 2008. The most significant factors that impacted operating income during 2009 were less favorable weather during the spring and summer months and a decline in economic conditions throughout 2009, both of which decreased electric sales. However, we experienced a decrease in fuel and purchased power costs largely due to lower MWh sales and a decrease in operating and maintenance expense during 2009 as compared to 2008. 2008 vs. 2007: Our utility energy segment contributed $580.5 million of operating income during 2008 compared with $584.7 million of operating income during 2007. During 2008, we experienced less favorable weather in the summer months, which decreased electric sales. In addition, our fuel and purchased power costs increased primarily as a result of the power purchase agreement entered into upon the sale of Point Beach. Finally, our other operating and maintenance expenses were higher due primarily to increased regulatory amortizations allowed in rates. These items were largely offset by our rate increases and increased margin from gas sales due to colder weather. 42 The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2009, 2008 and 2007: Utility Energy Segment 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,712.3 $2,686.4 $2,705.7 Gas 1,367.9 1,694.6 1,481.2 Other 39.1 40.3 35.2 Total Operating Revenues 4,119.3 4,421.3 4,222.1 Fuel and Purchased Power (a) 1,068.4 1,244.9 1,000.6 Cost of Gas Sold 912.0 1,220.9 1,052.3 Gross Margin 2,138.9 1,955.5 2,169.2 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance (a) 1,387.6 1,451.7 1,173.5 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization (a) 316.2 303.8 314.9 Property and Revenue Taxes 111.5 107.6 102.6 Total Operating Expenses 3,795.7 4,328.9 3,643.9 Amortization of Gain 230.7 488.1 6.5 Operating Income $554.3 $580.5 $584.7 (a) In September 2007, we sold Point Beach and commenced purchasing power from the new owner under a power purchase agreement. As a result of the sale and the power purchase agreement, our 2009 and 2008 earnings reflect higher fuel and purchased power costs as compared to 2007. In addition, as it relates to nuclear operating costs, our 2009 and 2008 operating income reflects lower other operation and maintenance costs and lower depreciation, decommissioning and amortization costs as we no longer own Point Beach. In January 2008, Wisconsin Electric received a rate order from the PSCW that authorized a 17.2% increase in electric rates to recover increased costs associated with transmission expenses, our PTF program, environmental expenditures, continued investment in renewable and efficiency programs and recovery of previously deferred regulatory assets. The PSCW allowed us to issue bill credits to our customers from the proceeds of the net gain and excess decommissioning funds associated with the sale of Point Beach to mitigate this increase. The PSCW also determined that $85.0 million of Point Beach proceeds should be immediately applied during the first quarter of 2008 to offset certain regulatory assets. As a result of these bill credits, we estimate that the January 2008 PSCW rate order resulted in a net 3.2% increase in electric rates paid by our Wisconsin customers in 2008 and resulted in another net increase of 3.2% in 2009. The bill credits that we issue to our customers and the proceeds immediately ap plied to regulatory assets are reflected on our income statement in the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. As we issue the bill credits, we transfer the cash from a restricted account to an unrestricted account. The transferred cash is equal to the bill credits, less taxes. 43 Electric Utility Gross Margin The following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2009 with similar information for 2008 and 2007, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh Sales Electric Utility Operations 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $993.4 $977.1 $929.6 8,122.9 8,448.1 8,586.6 Small Commercial/Industrial 881.8 890.6 861.7 8,800.0 9,260.3 9,430.3 Large Commercial/Industrial 613.9 659.6 676.9 9,348.4 10,903.0 11,245.6 Other Retail 21.7 21.2 19.7 162.9 167.7 168.7 Total Retail Sales 2,510.8 2,548.5 2,487.9 26,434.2 28,779.1 29,431.2 Wholesale Other 98.3 58.9 95.1 1,180.2 2,281.1 2,178.5 Resale Utilities 47.5 37.5 81.6 1,548.9 881.0 1,434.5 Other Operating Revenues 55.7 41.5 41.1 Total $2,712.3 $2,686.4 $2,705.7 29,163.3 31,941.2 33,044.2 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 518.4 570.8 570.1 Purchased Power 537.3 660.6 419.7 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,055.7 1,231.4 989.8 Total Electric Gross Margin $1,656.6 $1,455.0 $1,715.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,640 Normal) 6,825 7,073 6,508 Cooling (698 Normal) 475 593 800 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average. Electric Utility Revenues and Sales 2009 vs. 2008: Our electric utility operating revenue increased by $25.9 million, or 1.0%, when compared to 2008. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were: 2009 pricing increases totaling approximately $109.9 million reflecting the reduction of Point Beach credits to retail customers. A one time FERC approved refund to our wholesale customers in 2008 associated with their share of the gain on the sale of Point Beach that reduced 2008 wholesale revenues by $62.5 million. Net pricing increases totaling approximately $20.4 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders. Unfavorable weather that reduced electric revenues by an estimated $35.3 million as compared to 2008. A slowdown in the economy that reduced commercial and industrial sales by an estimated $129.0 million and wholesale sales by an estimated $30.9 million. Our total electric sales volumes decreased by approximately 8.7% as compared to 2008 due almost exclusively to a continued decline in economic conditions, which primarily affected our commercial and industrial sales, and milder weather, which primarily affected our residential sales. Total retail sales declined approximately 8.1%. Of the 8.1% decline in retail sales, approximately 7.0% relates to sales volumes at our large and small commercial and industrial customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2009 was 19.9% cooler than 2008 and 31.9% cooler than normal. We currently estimate that 2010 electric revenues will increase because of the impact of the 2010 PSCW rate increase, the reduction in the Point Beach bill credits and a slight increase in sales to large commercial and industrial customers as current economic conditions have improved slightly in our service territory. We would also expect residential sales to increase if we experience normal summer weather. However, we expect sales to small commercial and industrial customers to decrease slightly from 2009. For further information regarding the January 44 2010 PSCW rate order, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters 2010 Rate Case. 2008 vs. 2007: Our electric utility operating revenues decreased by $19.3 million, or 0.7%, when compared to 2007. The largest factor in this decline was a one time $62.5 million FERC approved refund to our wholesale customers associated with their share of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Consistent with past practices, the refund was recorded as a reduction in wholesale revenues. Because the refund came from the restricted cash associated with the sale of Point Beach, a corresponding entry was made to amortize the gain on the sale of Point Beach. We also estimate that weather reduced our revenues by approximately $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared the same period in 2007. As measured by cooling degree days, 2008 was approximately 25.9% cooler than 2007 and 17.5% cooler than normal. Resale sales declined by approximately $44.1 million primarily because of less favorable weather, which reduced demand for our higher cost generation that was not being utilized to serve our retail customers. In addition, we experienced a $9.0 million decrease in revenue related to the settlement of a billing dispute with our largest customers, two iron ore mines, that occurred in 2007. Partially offsetting these decreases, we estimate that our electric revenues were approximately $142.9 million higher than the same period in 2007 because of pricing increases we received in the January 2008 PSCW rate case, the interim April 2008 and final July 2008 PSCW fuel orders and a wholesale rate increase effective in May 2007. Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 2009 vs. 2008: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs decreased by $175.7 million, or approximately 14.3%, when compared to 2008. This decline was primarily caused by lower MWh sales and lower natural gas and purchased power prices, partially offset by higher coal and transportation costs. Approximately $41.2 million of this decrease related to the one time amortization of deferred fuel costs recorded in the first quarter of 2008 pursuant to the January 2008 PSCW rate order. Adjusted for the one time amortization, our electric fuel and purchased power costs decreased by $134.5 million, or 10.9%. We expect that electric fuel and purchased power expenses in 2010 will be impacted by the price of natural gas, changes in the cost of coal and related transportation prices and changes in electric sales. 2008 vs. 2007: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $241.6 million, or approximately 24.4%, when compared to 2007. The largest factor related to this increase was the power purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of Point Beach, which increased costs by approximately $247.0 million in 2008. In addition, in connection with the January 2008 PSCW rate order, we recorded a $41.2 million one time amortization of deferred fuel costs in the first quarter of 2008. After adjusting for the Point Beach power purchase agreement and one time amortization of deferred fuel cost, fuel and purchased power costs decreased by approximately $46.6 million, or 4.7%. Cost increases resulting from higher natural gas prices, purchased energy and coal and related transportation prices were more than offset by lower costs resulting from reduced MWh sales during 2008 as compared to 2007. Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2009, 2008 and 2007: Gas Utility Operations 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,367.9 $1,694.6 $1,481.2 Cost of Gas Sold 912.0 1,220.9 1,052.3 Gross Margin $ 455.9 $ 473.7 $ 428.9 45 We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2009, 2008 and 2007: Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $291.5 $299.5 $273.9 803.4 841.8 791.7 Commercial/Industrial 104.6 109.3 93.4 479.4 503.2 461.9 Interruptible 2.0 2.4 2.0 19.1 23.0 22.7 Total Retail 398.1 411.2 369.3 1,301.9 1,368.0 1,276.3 Transported Gas 49.6 52.2 51.7 882.0 905.8 921.6 Other Operating 8.2 10.3 7.9 Total $455.9 $473.7 $428.9 2,183.9 2,273.8 2,197.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,640 Normal) 6,825 7,073 6,508 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average. 2009 vs. 2008: Our gas margin decreased by $17.8 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2008. We estimate that milder winter weather and a decline in economic conditions caused margins to decrease by approximately $14.4 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. As measured by heating degree days, 2009 was 3.5% warmer than 2008, but 2.8% colder than normal. We expect our 2010 gas margins will be impacted by weather; however, as noted above, 2009 was colder than normal. 2008 vs. 2007: Our gas margin increased by $44.8 million, or approximately 10.4%, when compared to 2007. We estimate that approximately $22.5 million of this increase related to pricing increases that we received in the January 2008 PSCW rate order. Additionally, we estimate that weather had a positive impact on our gas margin of approximately $13.9 million. Temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) were 8.7% colder in 2008 as compared to 2007, and 5.9% colder than normal. Other Operation and Maintenance Expense 2009 vs. 2008: Our other operation and maintenance expense decreased by $64.1 million, or approximately 4.4%, when compared to 2008. The largest factor for this decrease relates to a $43.8 million one time amortization of deferred bad debt costs in 2008 pursuant to the January 2008 PSCW rate order. The January 2008 PSCW rate order, which was in effect for all of 2009, allowed for pricing increases related to transmission costs, PTF lease costs and the amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $15.9 million higher in 2009 as compared to 2008. The remaining decrease is primarily related to reduced operating and maintenance expenses at our power plants and electric distribution system. Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by wage inflation, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2010 other operation and maintenance expenses to increase because of costs associated with the new Oak Creek units and regulatory amortizations. 2008 vs. 2007: Our other operation and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $278.2 million, or 23.7%, when compared to 2007. The January 2008 PSCW rate order allowed for pricing increases related to transmission costs, PTF lease costs and the amortization of other deferred costs. These items were $262.8 million higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition to these regulatory amortizations, in connection with the January 2008 PSCW rate order, we recorded a one time $43.8 million amortization of deferred bad debt costs in the first quarter of 2008. We also incurred approximately $64.1 million of increased expenses related to the operation and maintenance of our power plants and electric distribution system. These increased costs were also considered in the 46 rate setting process. These increases were partially offset by a $119.7 million decrease in nuclear operation and maintenance expense related to Point Beach as we sold the plant in September 2007. Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization Expense 2009 vs. 2008: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense increased by $12.4 million, or approximately 4.1%, when compared to 2008. This increase was the result of higher depreciation related to new capital projects placed in service, including the Blue Sky Green Field wind project which was placed into service in May 2008. We expect depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense to decrease by approximately $50 million in 2010 because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the January 2010 PSCW rate order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets. 2008 vs. 2007: Depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense decreased by approximately $11.1 million, or 3.5%, when compared to 2007. The 2007 sale of Point Beach reduced depreciation, decommissioning and amortization expense by approximately $24 million. Partially offsetting this decline was higher depreciation related to new projects including the Blue Sky Green Field wind project. Amortization of Gain In connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached agreements with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits are being returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it is being amortized to the income statement as we issue bill credits or make refunds to customers. When the bill credits and refunds are issued to customers, we transfer cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Amortization of Gain was as follows: Amortization of Gain 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Bill Credits Retail $230.7 $340.6 $6.5 One Time FERC Refund 62.5 One Time Amortization to Offset Regulatory Asset 85.0 Total Amortization of Gain $230.7 $488.1 $6.5 During 2010, we expect to see a reduction in the Amortization of Gain of approximately $36.0 million related to the scheduled decrease in bill credits to retail customers compared to 2009. We expect that all remaining bill credits will be issued by the end of 2010. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME The most significant subsidiary included in this segment is We Power, which constructs and owns power plants associated with our PTF strategy and leases them to Wisconsin Electric. This segment primarily reflects revenues billed under the leases for PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and the new Oak Creek coal handling and water intake systems and the related depreciation expense. 47 Non Utility Energy Segment 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $163.1 $126.2 $75.7 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 13.3 14.6 15.9 Depreciation, Decommissioning and Amortization 29.2 21.9 12.1 Property and Revenue Taxes 0.5 0.4 0.3 Operating Income $120.1 $89.3 $47.4 Note: We Powers PTF lease revenues and Wisconsin Electrics lease costs are eliminated in consolidation. 2009 vs. 2008: Our non utility energy segment contributed $120.1 million of operating income in 2009 compared to operating income of $89.3 million in 2008. This increase primarily relates to a full year of earnings from PWGS 2, which was placed in service in May 2008, and the earnings from the water intake system at Oak Creek, which was placed in service in January 2009. In 2010, we expect our non utility energy segment to generate significantly higher operating income in connection with our new coal plants. OC 1was placed in service on February 2, 2010. Bechtel is targeting commercial operation of OC 2 by the end of August 2010. 2008 vs. 2007: Our non utility energy segment contributed $89.3 million of operating income in 2008 compared to operating income of $47.4 million in 2007. This increase was primarily related to lease income from PWGS 2 and the full year impact of the coal handling system for Oak Creek, which was placed in service in November 2007. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2009 vs. 2008: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10.7 million in 2009 compared with an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2008. In the foreseeable future, we expect to have slight operating losses as we have minimal business operations in this segment. 2008 vs. 2007: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2008 compared with an operating loss of $4.9 million in 2007. The increase in operating loss was primarily related to reduced real estate sales during 2008 as compared to 2007. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET The following table identifies the components of consolidated other income and deductions, net during 2009, 2008 and 2007: Other Income and Deductions, net 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Carrying Costs $ $ 0.8 $28.8 Gain on Property Sales 1.7 2.6 13.1 AFUDC Equity 16.0 7.8 5.2 Other, net 10.7 5.8 1.8 Total Other Income and Deductions, net $28.4 $17.0 $48.9 2009 vs. 2008: Other income and deductions, net increased by $11.4 million when compared to 2008 primarily due to higher interest income and an increase in AFUDC Equity related to the construction of our Oak Creek AQCS 48 project. We expect to see an increase in AFUDC Equity during 2010 with the continued construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project at Wisconsin Electric. 2008 vs. 2007: Other income and deductions, net decreased by $31.9 million when compared to 2007. We stopped accruing carrying charges on regulatory assets as the January 2008 PSCW rate order allowed a current return on them. Additionally, in 2007 we recognized approximately $13.1 million on property sales, most of which related to land sales in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, as compared to $2.6 million in 2008. CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest Expense, net 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Interest Costs $235.4 $240.3 $240.9 Less: Capitalized Interest 78.7 86.6 73.3 Interest Expense, net $156.7 $153.7 $167.6 2009 vs. 2008: Interest expense, net increased by $3.0 million during 2009 when compared with 2008. Our gross interest costs decreased by $4.9 million and our capitalized interest decreased by $7.9 million primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower capital expenditures. During 2010, we expect interest expense, net to increase significantly as we will stop capitalizing interest expense related to the Oak Creek units once they are placed into service. In addition, we expect to issue long term debt and to use the net proceeds to repay the short term borrowings that we incurred during the construction of the units. 2008 vs. 2007: Interest expense, net decreased by $13.9 million in 2008 when compared with 2007. Our gross interest costs decreased by $0.6 million because of lower short term interest rates that were offset in part by higher debt balances. Our capitalized interest increased $13.3 million, primarily because of increased construction in progress at our Oak Creek units. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 2009 vs. 2008: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 36.6% in 2009 compared to 37.7% in 2008. This reduction in our effective tax rate was the result of tax credits associated with wind production. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2010 annual effective tax rate to range between 35.0% and 36.0%. 2008 vs. 2007: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 37.7% in 2008 compared to 39.1% in 2007. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increases in the production tax deductions and wind credits. 49 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2009, 2008 and 2007: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $628.8 $736.4 $532.4 Investing Activities ($736.1) ($906.3) ($543.1) Financing Activities $95.7 $175.0 $1.1 Operating Activities 2009 vs. 2008: Cash provided by operating activities was $628.8 million during 2009, which was $107.6 million lower than 2008. Although we experienced an increase in net income and depreciation during 2009, our operating cash flows declined because of large contributions to our pension and post retirement benefit plans. In January 2009, we contributed $289.3 million to our benefit plans as compared to approximately $48.4 million in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007: Cash provided by operating activities was $736.4 million during 2008 which was $204.0 million higher than 2007, primarily because of higher cash earnings and lower tax payments. During 2008, our cash earnings were higher than in 2007 because of increased amortizations of deferred costs associated with regulatory assets. During 2008, our cash taxes were $289.2 million lower than 2007, primarily because of additional tax depreciation, increased deductions for contributions to our pension plan and deferred taxes associated with the nuclear decommissioning trust assets. In accordance with IRS guidelines, we completed a review in 2008 and concluded that certain timing items that historically had been capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes could be deducted currently. Our January 2009 contribution to our qualified pension plan resulted in a tax deduction for 2008. Investing Activities 2009 vs. 2008: Cash used in investing activities was $736.1 million during 2009, which was $170.2 million lower than the same period in 2008. This decline primarily reflects lower capital expenditures and cash flows from the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits during 2009. During 2009, our capital expenditures decreased $318.7 million, primarily due to the reduction in capital expenditures for OC 1 and OC 2 and the completion of PWGS 2 in 2008. During 2010, we expect our utility capital expenditures to increase because of the continued construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the start of construction of our recently approved Glacier Hills wind farm project. See Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Oak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval and Renewable Energy Portfolio under Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on the projects. During 2009, we released $153.1 million less from restricted cash as compared to the same period in 2008. In September 2007, we sold Point Beach and placed approximately $924 million of cash in restricted accounts to be used for the payment of taxes and for the benefit of our customers. We release the restricted cash, adjusted for taxes, as we issue bill credits to our customers, which is reflected as an amortization of the gain on our income statement. We expect to release approximately $194.5 million of restricted cash during 2010 as we issue bill credits to our retail customers from the Point Beach proceeds. 2008 vs. 2007: Cash used in investing activities was $906.3 million during 2008, an increase of $363.2 million over 2007. This increase reflects a reduction in proceeds from asset sales, partially offset by lower capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash from the sale of Point Beach released to us. During 2008, we released $345.1 million of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. In addition, our capital expenditures decreased $73.8 million in 2008, primarily due to reduced construction spending related to our PTF generation plants. This was partially offset by increased spending at Wisconsin Electric related to the completion of 50 our Blue Sky Green Field wind project and the start of construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project. Although, we experienced a significant inflow of cash in 2007 related to the sale of Point Beach, we restricted a significant amount of that cash until it is released as we issue bill credits. The following table identifies capital expenditures by year: Capital Expenditures 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $550.1 $606.7 $539.0 We Power 253.2 529.3 667.3 Other 14.4 0.4 3.9 Total Capital Expenditures $817.7 $1,136.4 $1,210.2 Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of Dollars) Increase in Debt $263.2 $316.8 $148.4 Dividends on Common Stock (157.8) (126.3) (116.9) Common Stock, Net (12.6) (11.4) (31.7) Other 2.9 (4.1) 1.3 Cash Provided by Financing $95.7 $175.0 $1.1 2009 vs. 2008: Cash provided by financing activities during 2009 was $95.7 million, compared to $175.0 million during the same period in 2008. During 2009, we issued a total of $261.5 million in long term debt and retired $74.1 million of long term debt. Substantially all of the net proceeds were used to repay short term debt. During 2009, we paid approximately $157.8 million in cash dividends and Wisconsin Electric repurchased $147 million of outstanding tax exempt bonds in August 2009. For additional information on the debt issues and repurchase by Wisconsin Electric, see Note K Long Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our common stock dividends increased in 2009 as we raised our dividend rate by 25%. In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved an 18.5% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend. 2008 vs. 2007: During 2008, cash provided by financing activities was $175.0 million compared to $1.1 million in 2007. During 2008, we issued a total of $966 million in long term debt and retired $350.8 million of long term debt. The net proceeds were used to repay short term debt. No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2009, 2008 or 2007. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 0.7 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, 0.5 million shares at a cost of $23.0 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $67.8 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received proceeds of $17.0 million, $11.6 million and $36.1 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligation under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS In 2000, we announced a growth strategy which, among other things, called for us to sell certain assets and reduce our debt levels. Our debt to total capital ratio has decreased from 68.3% at September 30, 2000 to 58.1% at December 31, 2009 due, in large part, to these asset sales. Over the next several years, we expect to have some limited asset sales, but at levels significantly lower than prior years. For more information on some of these sales, 51 including the sale of Edison Sault and our ownership interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5, see Note D Asset Sales, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Working Capital As of December 31, 2009, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $420.2 million. This negative working capital balance is a result of financing the construction of OC 1 and OC 2 with significant amounts of short term debt. OC 1 was placed into service on February 2, 2010. In February 2010, we issued $530.0 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to construct OC 1. We anticipate financing a portion of the construction costs of OC 2 with long term debt upon commercial operation of OC 2. We expect these transactions to significantly improve our working capital position. Capital Resources We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2010 primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors, including the Oak Creek financings discussed under Working Capital above. Beyond 2010, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by short term borrowings and the issuance of debt securities. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash. Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. An affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, provided approximately $80 million of commitments under our bank back up credit facilities on a consolidated basis. We have no current plans to replace Lehmans commitments. Excluding Lehmans commitments, as of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.6 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $820.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2009: Company Total Facility * Letters of Credit Credit Available * Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $857.5 $1.1 $856.4 April 2011 Wisconsin Electric $476.4 $2.4 $474.0 March 2011 Wisconsin Gas $285.8 $ $285.8 March 2011 * Excludes Lehmans commitments Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions. The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 52 2009 2008 Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,566.9 $3,816.9 $3,336.9 $3,586.9 Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,171.5 3,921.5 4,136.5 3,886.5 Short Term Debt 825.1 825.1 602.3 602.3 Total Capitalization $8,593.9 $8,593.9 $8,106.1 $8,106.1 Total Debt $4,996.6 $4,746.6 $4,738.8 $4,488.8 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 58.1% 55.2% 58.5% 55.4% Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure. As described in Note J Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2009, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties. Access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. The following table summarizes the ratings of our debt securities and the debt securities and preferred stock of our subsidiaries by S&P, Moodys and Fitch as of December 31, 2009: 53 S&P Moodys Fitch Wisconsin Energy Commercial Paper A 2 P 2 F2 Unsecured Senior Debt BBB+ A3 A Unsecured Junior Notes BBB Baa1 BBB+ Wisconsin Electric Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Secured Senior Debt A Aa3 AA Unsecured Debt A A1 A+ Preferred Stock BBB A3 A Wisconsin Gas Commercial Paper A 2 P 1 F1 Unsecured Senior Debt A A1 A+ Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation Unsecured Debt BBB+ A3 A In February 2010, S&P, Moodys and Fitch rated ERGSS Senior Notes A , A1 and A+, respectively. The ratings outlook assigned by S&P, Moodys and Fitch to ERGSS is stable, stable and negative, respectively. In July 2009, S&P affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable. In June 2009, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation and the stable ratings outlook of Wisconsin Gas. Fitch also revised the ratings outlooks of Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation from stable to negative. The security rating outlooks assigned by Moodys for Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Energy Capital Corporation are all stable. Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe these security ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 54 Capital Requirements Our estimated 2010, 2011 and 2012 capital expenditures are as follows: Capital Expenditures 2010 2011 2012 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Renewable $96.6 $392.8 $289.6 Environmental 301.7 170.6 69.2 Base Spending 406.2 436.0 445.3 Total Utility 804.5 999.4 804.1 We Power 136.2 13.1 25.7 Other 9.8 5.1 5.1 Total $950.5 $1,017.6 $834.9 Changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards and renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment may cause actual future long term capital requirements to vary from these estimates. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2009. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. In January 2009, we contributed $270 million to our qualified pension plans due to poor investment returns during 2008. We do not expect to make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they are adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note P Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have identified two tolling and purchased power agreements with third parties but have been unable to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of these two variable interest entities. The requested information required to make this determination has not been supplied. As a result, we do not consolidate these entities. We account for one of these contracts as a capital lease and for the other contract as an operating lease, and both are reflected in the Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments table below. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $7,115.8 $513.4 $860.1 $1,036.3 $4,706.0 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 369.0 36.2 76.5 82.3 174.0 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 76.0 21.3 36.6 8.4 9.7 Purchase Obligations (e) 13,807.3 1,345.7 1,492.6 930.8 10,038.2 Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 85.2 84.5 0.7 Total Contractual Obligations $21,453.3 $2,001.1 $2,466.5 $2,057.8 $14,927.9 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. (b) Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations). For the purpose of determining our contractual obligations and commercial commitments only, we assumed the Junior Notes would be retired in 2017 with the proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities pursuant to the terms of the RCC. (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for power purchase commitments. (d) Operating Lease Obligations for power purchase commitments and vehicle and rail car leases. (e) Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. This includes the power purchase agreement for all of the energy produced by Point Beach. (f) Other Long Term Liabilities includes the expected 2010 supplemental executive retirement plan obligation. For additional information on employer contributions to our benefit plans, see Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes. For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Large Construction Projects: In November 2003, the PSCW issued a written order granting a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW supercritical pulverized coal generating units adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. The order approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including a target construction cost of the Oak Creek expansion of $2.191 billion, plus, subject to PSCW approval, cost over runs of up to 5%, costs attributable to force majeure events, excused events and event of loss provisions. OC 1 was placed into service on February 2, 2010. Bechtel is targeting the commercial operation of OC 2 by the end of August 2010. For additional information, see Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion. 56 Large construction projects of this type, as well as the construction of renewable energy generation and environmental improvements, are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time. These risks include, but are not limited to, shortages of, the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials, the ability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts, strikes, adverse weather conditions, legal challenges, changes in applicable law or regulations, adverse interpretation or enforcement of permit conditions, laws and regulations by the courts or permitting agencies, the inability to obtain necessary operating permits in a timely manner, other governmental actions and events in the global economy. If final costs of the Oak Creek expansion are within 5% of the costs initially approved by the PSCW, and the additional costs are deemed to be prudent by the PSCW, the final lease payments for the Oak Creek expansion recovered from Wisconsin Electric would be adjusted to reflect the actual construction costs. Any costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or an event of loss. Once the units are completed, and in light of the weather delays incurred on the project, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units. See Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion below for a discussion of the Settlement Agreement entered into with Bechtel. Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospect ive basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range (plus or minus 2% for 2010) when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted prospectively. For information regarding the current fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for our gas utility operations through GCRMs, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. In March 2005, the PSCW authorized the use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As part of the January 2010 PSCW rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2011. As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. 57 Weather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2009, 2008 and 2007, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations. Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2009 of our outstanding portfolio of $820.9 million of commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of 0.28% and $407.0 million of variable rate long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 1.93%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million before taxes from short term borrowings and $4.1 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2009 was approximately: Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,026.0 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $202.6 The expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25% for both the pension and other post retirement benefits for 2009. During 2009, we contributed $270 million to our pension plans which brought the plans close to fully funded under the Pension Protection Act. As a result, we changed our asset mix to a higher weighting of fixed income securities and a lower weighting of equity securities. In 2010, our expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets is 7.25% reflecting the change in asset allocations. The lower expected return on plan assets will increase 2010 pension costs by approximately $10 million; however, increased pension expense was considered in the rate setting process by the PSCW. Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers. Subsequent to our last asset/liability study completed in 2005, we have consulted with our investment advisors on an annual basis and requested them to forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund. Credit Ratings: We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment only in the event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payment required under these agreements totaled approximately $196.9 million. In addition, we have 58 commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties. Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. POWER THE FUTURE Under our PTF strategy, we expect to meet a significant portion of our future generation needs through the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion by We Power. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following tables identify certain key items related to the units: Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $ 333 million PWGS 2 May 2008 $ 331 million Unit Name Scheduled In Service Approximate Cash Costs (a) OC 1 February 2010 (Actual) $ 1,346 million OC 2 August 2010 $ 670 million (a) Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage. We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates. The lease payments are based on the cash costs authorized by the PSCW. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return is determined up to 180 days prior to the date that the units are placed in service. Power the Future Port Washington Background: In December 2002, the PSCW issued a written order (the Port Order) granting a CPCN for the construction of PWGS consisting of two 545 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and 59 Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Port Order, which do not include the key financial terms. Power the Future Oak Creek Expansion Background: In November 2003, the PSCW issued an order (the Oak Creek Order) granting Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and We Power a CPCN to commence construction of two 615 MW coal fired units (the Oak Creek expansion) to be located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 was placed into service on February 2, 2010. Bechtel is currently targeting the commercial operation of OC 2 by the end of August 2010. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion, and the order provided for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In June 2005, construction commenced at the site. In November 2005, we completed the sale of approximately a 17% interest in the two units to two unaffiliated entities, who share ratably in the construction costs. Although these two unaffiliated entities have a combined ownership interest in approximately 17% of the MWs generated by the two units, they only have a 15% ownership interest in the Oak Creek expansion as a whole, taking into account the common facilities being constructed, including the coal handling and water intake systems. The Oak Creek expansion includes a new coal handling system that will serve both the existing units at Oak Creek and OC 1 and OC 2. The new coal handling system was placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2007 at a cost of approximately $199.1 million. The Oak Creek expansion also includes a new water intake system that will serve both the existing units at Oak Creek and OC 1 and OC 2. The new water intake system was placed into service in January 2009 at a cost of approximately $132.6 million. Lease Terms: In October 2004, the PSCW approved the leased generation contracts between Wisconsin Electric and We Power for OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts include: Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the Oak Creek Order, which do not include the key financial terms. Construction Status: Bechtel, the contractor of the Oak Creek expansion under a fixed price contract, submitted claims to us for schedule and cost relief on December 22, 2008 related to the delay of the in service dates for OC 1 and OC 2. These claims were asserted against ERS, the project manager for the construction of the Oak Creek expansion and agent for the joint owners of OC 1 and OC 2. On October 30, 2009, Bechtel amended its claim to increase its request for cost and schedule relief. In its amended claim, Bechtel requested cost relief totaling approximately $517.5 million and schedule relief that would have resulted in approximately seven months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and approximately four months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2010 for OC 2. Bechtels first claim was based on the alleged impact of severe weather and certain labor related matters. Pursuant to its amended claim, Bechtel was requesting approximately $445.5 million in costs related to changed weather and labor conditions. Bechtels second claim of approximately $72 million sought cost and schedule relief for the alleged effects of ERS directed changes and delays allegedly caused by ERS prior to the issuance of the Full Notice to Proceed in July 2005. These claims, as well as claims submitted by ERS related to the rights of the parties under the construction contract and ERS counterclaims, had been submitted to binding arbitration. 60 Effective December 16, 2009, ERS and Bechtel entered into the Settlement Agreement that settled all claims between them regarding OC 1 and OC 2. Pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement, ERS will pay to Bechtel $72 million to settle these claims, with $10 million already paid in 2009 and the remaining $62 million to be paid in six additional installments upon the achievement of specific project milestones. In addition, Bechtel will receive 120 days of schedule relief for OC 1 and 60 days for OC 2. Therefore, the guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 was extended to January 27, 2010, and the guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2010 for OC 2 was extended to November 28, 2010. We are responsible for approximately 85% of amounts paid under the Settlement Agreement, consistent with our ownership share of the Oak Creek expansion. The other joint owners are responsible for the remainder. OC 1 was placed into service on February 2, 2010. Bechtel is currently targeting commercial operation of OC 2 by the end of August 2010. The Settlement Agreement also provides for Bechtels release of ERS from all matters related to Bechtels claims, among other things, and for ERS release of Bechtel from all matters related to ERS claims that were subject to arbitration, among other things. WPDES Permit: In July 2008, in order to resolve all outstanding challenges to the WPDES permit issued by the WDNR in connection with the Oak Creek expansion, we and with the other two joint owners of the Oak Creek expansion reached an agreement with Clean Wisconsin, Inc. and Sierra Club, the groups who were opposing the WPDES permit. Under the settlement agreement, these groups agreed to withdraw their opposition to the modified WPDES permit issued in July 2008 for the existing and expansion units at Oak Creek. In the agreement with Clean Wisconsin, Inc. and Sierra Club, we committed to contribute our share of $5 million (approximately $4.2 million) towards projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also agreed (i) for the 25 year period ending 2034, subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to contribute our share of up to $4 million per year (approximately $3.3 million) to fund projects to address Lake Michigan water quality, and (ii) subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to develop new solar and biomass generation projects. We also agreed to support state legislation to increase the renewable portfolio standard to 10% by 2013 and 25% by 2025, and to retire 116 MW of coal fired generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant. In its December 2009 decision, based upon a proposal submitted by the parties to the settlement agreement, the PSCW authorized recovery of $2.0 million per year for 2010 and 2011 related to costs associated with projects to address Lake Michigan water quality and recovery of $2.0 million of the second $2.5 million payment related to projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based upon this decision, the parties are proceeding to implement the settlement agreement. We are responsible for our pro rata share of these payments. UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas, steam and water rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 88% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Valley steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%. 61 In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million. In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments: An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric; A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric; An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; and A decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Downtown Milwaukee (Valley) steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers. These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%. The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations: New depreciation rates are incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case; Certain regulatory assets currently scheduled to be fully amortized over the next four years are to instead be amortized over the next eight years; and Wisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of CWIP for the environmental control projects at its Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on Glacier Hills Wind Park. 2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million (9.5%), effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. This rate increase is subject to refund with interest, depending upon the MPSCs final decision on Wisconsin Electrics $42 million rate request, which is expected in July 2010. 2008 Wisconsin Rate Increase: During 2007, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings. On January 17, 2008, the PSCW approved pricing increases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas as follows: $389.1 million (17.2%) in electric rates for Wisconsin Electric the pricing increase was offset by bill credits in 2008 and 2009; $4.0 million (0.6%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Electric; $3.6 million (11.2%) for steam service from Wisconsin Electric; and $20.1 million (2.2%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Gas. In addition, the PSCW lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from 11.2% to 10.75%. The PSCW also determined that $85.0 million of the Point Beach proceeds should be immediately applied to offset certain regulatory assets. 2008 Michigan Rate Increase: In January, 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the MPSC. This request represented an increase in electric rates of 14.7%, or $22.0 million, to support the growing demand for electricity, continued investment in renewable programs, compliance with environmental regulations, addition of distribution infrastructure and increased operational expenses. In November 2008, a settlement agreement with the MPSC staff and intervenors for a rate increase of $7.2 million, or 4.6%, was approved by the MPSC, effective January 1, 2009. Limited Rate Adjustment Requests 2010 Fuel Recovery Request: On February 19, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs is being driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. We expect to implement this rate request by the end of the first quarter of 62 2010, subject to refund based upon the PSCWs final decision. The ultimate rate increase will be subject to the review and approval of the PSCW, which we expect to receive by the end of 2010. 2009 Fuel Cost Decrease Filing: Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity to its retail customers in Wisconsin. In April 2009, based on three months of actual fuel cost data and nine months of projected data, Wisconsin Electric forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the monitored fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. Therefore, in April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million for calendar year 2009. On April 30, 2009, the PSCW approved the fuel cost decrease filing with rates effective May 1, 2009. 2008 Fuel Recovery Request: In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel costs was being driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas and the higher cost of transporting coal by rail as a result of increases in the cost of diesel fuel. On April 11, 2008, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $76.9 million (3.3%) in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. In July 2008, we received the final rate order, which authorized an additional $42.0 million in rate increases, for a total increase of $118.9 million (5.1%). Any over collection of fuel surcharge revenue in calendar year 2008 was subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.75%. In April 2009, the PSCW ordered that we should refund $8.8 million (including interest) of over collected fuel surcharge revenue. The refund was issued during the second quarter of 2009. Other Utility Rate Matters Oak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $800 million ($950 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA. Michigan Legislation: During October 2008, Michigan enacted legislation to make significant changes in regulatory procedures, which should provide for more timely cost recovery. Public Act 286 allows the use of a forward looking test year in rate cases rather than historical data, and allows us to put interim rates into effect six months after filing a complete case. Rate filings for which an order is not issued within 12 months are deemed approved. In addition, we could seek a CPCN for new investment, and could recover interest on the investment during construction. Public Act 286 also gives the MPSC expanded authority over proposed mergers and acquisitions, and requires action within 180 days of filing. In addition, Public Act 295 calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard of 10% by 2015, and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the stan dards, and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective. Fuel Cost Adjustment Procedure: Within the state of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity and purchase power contracts. Embedded within its base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the current fuel rules, no adjustments are made to rates as long as fuel and purchased power costs are expected to be within a band of the costs embedded in current rates for the 12 month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs are expected to fall outside of the band, and actual costs fall outside of established fuel bands, then we may file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. In June 2006, the PSCW opened a docket (01 AC 224) to consider revisions to the existing fuel rules (Chapter PSC 116). The current version of the revised rule recommends modifications to allow for annual plan and reconciliation filings of fuel costs by each regulated utility. In the period between plan and reconciliation, escrow accounting would be used to record fuel costs outside a plus or minus 2% annual band of the total fuel costs allowed in rates. The proposed rule further recommends that the escrow balance be trued up annually following the end of each calendar year. Currently, draft legislation is under review. The earliest that we expect any possible action on the fuel rules is mid 2010. 63 Edison Sault and Wisconsin Electrics operations in Michigan operate under a Power Supply Cost Recovery mechanism which generally allows for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a dollar for dollar basis. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2009, we had deferred $157.8 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. Prior to 2010, there was an incentive mechanism under the GCRMs that allowed for increased revenues if we acquired gas at prices lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW. However, as part of the January 2010 PSCW rate order, the PSCW approved changing from an incentive method to a modified one for one method. The new method does not have revenue sharing. The GCRMs measure commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin. Bad Debt Costs: In March 2005, the PSCW approved our use of escrow accounting for residential bad debt costs. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As part of the January 2010 PSCW rate order, the escrow accounting method for bad debt costs was extended through December 31, 2011. MISO Energy Markets: The PSCW approved deferral treatment for our costs related to the implementation of the MISO Energy Markets. Amounts deferred through December 31, 2007 are being recovered in rates. For additional information, see Industry Restructuring and Competition Electric Transmission and Energy Markets. Wholesale Electric Pricing: In August 2006, Wisconsin Electric filed a wholesale rate case with FERC. The filing requested an annual increase in rates of approximately $16.7 million applicable to four existing wholesale electric customers. This includes a mechanism for fuel and other cost adjustments. In November 2006, FERC approved the rate filing subject to refund with interest. Three of the existing customers rates were effective in January 2007. The remaining wholesale customers rates were effective in May 2007. FERC approved a settlement of the rate filing in September 2007. In August 2008, we issued a one time $62.5 million refund to our wholesale customers pursuant to a FERC approved settlement related to the sale of Point Beach. Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We do not expect the new depreciation rates to have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates. Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wiscon sin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. Assuming the bulk of additional renewables is wind generation, Wisconsin Electric must obtain approximately 362 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2012 and another approximately 300 MW of additional renewable capacity by 2015 to meet the requirements of Act 141. We have 64 already started development of additional sources of renewable energy which will assist us in complying with Act 141. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below. In 2007, the Governor of Wisconsin established the Governors Task Force on Global Warming. The Task Force issued its final report in July 2008 that includes an increased renewable portfolio standard. Pursuant to the Task Forces recommendations, the renewable portfolio standard would increase to 10% by 2013, 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025. Draft legislation regarding this recommendation, as well as other recommendations made by the Task Force, is pending in the Wisconsin legislature Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, ( 3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels. Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the DOA back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 requires that 1.2% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs. The Governor of Wisconsins Task Force on Global Warming recommended in July 2008 that the energy efficiency goal be based on achieving efficiency resulting in a 2% reduction in electric load annually starting in 2015 rather than a goal based on a percent of revenue. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective. Renewable Energy Portfolio: In May 2008, the Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, reached commercial operation. In July 2008, we completed the purchase of rights to a new wind farm site in Central Wisconsin, Glacier Hills Wind Park, and filed a request for a CPCN with the PSCW in October 2008. We entered into a conditional turbine agreement for the new wind facility and filed a revised, lower cost estimate with the PSCW in May 2009 of $335.2 million to $413.5 million, excluding AFUDC. The PSCW approved the CPCN in January 2010. We currently expect to install up to 90 wind turbines with generating capacity of up to approximately 207 MW, subject to turbine selection and the final site configuration. We expect 2012 to be the first full year of operation. In September 2009, we announced plans to construct a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood, waste and sawdust will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. We believe the biomass plant will be eligible for either the federal production tax credit or the federal 30% investment tax credit. We currently expect the plant to cost approximately $250 million and to be completed during the fall of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect to file a request for a Certificate of Authority for the project in the first quarter of 2010. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy. 65 We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2009 and 2008. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2010. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as CO2, SO2, NOx, fine particulates and mercury; (2) disposal of combustion by products such as fly ash; and (3) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites. We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) improving our overall energy portfolio by adding more efficient generation as part of our PTF strategy; (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (3) reviewing water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water requirements; (4) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (5) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (6) evaluating and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems; (7) continuing the beneficial re use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (8) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. The capital cost of implementing the EPA Consent Decree is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion over the 10 year period ending 2013. These costs are principally associated with the installation of air quality controls on Pleasant Prairie Units 1 and 2 and Oak Creek Units 5 8. In June 2007, we submitted an application to the PSCW requesting approval to construct environmental controls at Oak Creek Units 5 8 by 2012 as required by the Consent Decree. We expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $800 million, excluding AFUDC. Through December 31, 2009, we have spent approximately $686 million associated with the installation of air quality controls and have retired four coal units as part of our plan under the Consent Decree. For further information concerning the Consent Decree, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Air Quality: 8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. States were required to develop and submit SIPs to the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intended to comply with the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. Instead of submitting a SIP, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate all counties in southeastern Wisconsin as in attainment with the standard. In addition to the request for redesignation, Wisconsin also adopted the RACT rule that applies to emissions from our power plants in the affected areas of Wisconsin. Compliance with the NOx emission reduction requirements under the Consent Decree has substantially mitigated costs to comply with the RACT rule. In March 2008, the EPA issued a determination that the state of Wisconsin had failed to submit a SIP. In July 2009, Wisconsin issued both a draft Attainment Demonstration and a Redesignation request. Based on our review of these drafts, we do not believe we would be subject to any further requirements to reduce emissions. The EPA must take final approval action once Wisconsin finalizes its submittals. In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. Given this most recent revision, the EPA has delayed the deadline for new non attainment area designations under the revised standard once it is finalized, from March 2010 to March 2011. Although it is likely that additional counties may be designated as non attainment areas under the revised standard, until those designations become final and until any potential additional rules are adopted, we are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities. Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated PM2.5 non attainment areas. All counties in Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard became effective; however, on February 24, 2009 the D.C. 66 Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. The Courts decision will likely result in an even more stringent annual PM2.5 standard. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin will now have three years to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements cannot be determined at this time. Similarly, until the EPA revises the 2006 standard consistent with the courts decision and the states develop rules and submit SIPs to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with that standard, we are unable to predict the impact of this more restrictive standard on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities or our new PTF generating units being lease d by Wisconsin Electric including OC 1, OC 2, PWGS 1 and PWGS 2. In a related matter, on February 11, 2010, the EPA announced its intent to end the transitional policy which has allowed facilities to use in their air permits PM10 (an earlier measure of particulate matter) as a surrogate when measuring PM2.5 emissions. This policy had allowed both the agencies and permit holders to continue to use standards that were well established, until the EPA and the states developed the necessary tools for permitting PM2.5 emissions. The discontinuation of this policy creates uncertainty as to how this parameter will be evaluated when we seek and maintain Title V air permits for our facilities. The EPA will be taking written comments on the rule and until the rule is finalized, we are not able to predict the impact of this policy change on our operations. Sulfur Dioxide Standard: The EPA is currently in the process of revising the ambient air quality standard for SO2. In November 2009, the EPA proposed to strengthen the primary standard for SO2 by revoking the current standards and replacing them with a more stringent one hour SO2 standard. If the revised standard ultimately selected results in the designation of new non attainment areas, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our facilities in those areas. Clean Air Interstate Rule: The EPA issued the final CAIR in March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8 hour ozone and PM2.5 standards by addressing the regional transport of SO2 and NOx. CAIR required NOx and SO2 emission reductions in two phases from electric generating units located in a 28 state region within the eastern United States, including Wisconsin and Michigan. Overall, CAIR is expected to result in a 70% reduction in SO2 emissions and a 65% reduction in NOx emissions from 2002 emission levels. A final CAIR rule was adopted in Wisconsin and Michigan. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit invalidated several aspects of CAIR and remanded the rule to the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. We previously determined that compliance with the NOx and SO2 emission reductions requirements under the Consent Decree would substantially mit igate costs to comply with CAIR and would achieve the levels necessary under at least the first phase of CAIR. It will be necessary to see what the revised rule contains before we can determine if any additional reductions will be required. Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: The EPA issued the final CAMR in March 2005, addressing mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants. The federal rule was challenged by a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated CAMR and sent the rule back to the EPA for reconsideration. In December 2008, a number of environmental groups filed a complaint with the D.C. Circuit asking that the court place the EPA on a schedule for promulgating MACT limits for fossil fuel fired electric utilities to address hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. In October 2009, the EPA published notice of a proposed consent decree in connection with this litigation that would place the EPA on a schedule to set a MACT rule for coal and oil fired electric generating units in 2011. The EPA is currently in the process of developing the proposed MACT rule which is expected to reduce emissions of numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. Wisconsin and Michigan State Only Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan now have mercury rules in place. Both states require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs. Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued CAVR in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines BART requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. States were required to submit SIPs to implement CAVR by December 2007. Wisconsin has not yet 67 submitted a SIP. Michigan submitted a SIP, which was partially approved. In response to a citizen suit, in January 2009, the EPA issued a finding of failure to 37 states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, regarding their failure to submit SIPs. The finding starts a two year review window for the EPA to issue Federal Implementation Plans, unless a state submits and receives SIP approval. Wisconsin and Michigan have completed the BART rules, which cover one aspect of CAVR regulations. Wisconsin BART rules became effective in July 2008 and Michigan BART rules became effective in September 2008. Both Wisconsin and Michigan BART rules are based, in part, on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. Therefore, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until the EPA completes a new CAIR rule pursuant to a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit requiring it to do so. EPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support a voluntary approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including: Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units. Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that will be the most thermally efficient coal units in our system. Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation. Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow&reg; renewable energy program. Retirement of Coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions continue to be considered in the U.S. Congress, and the President and his administration have made it clear that they are focused on reducing CO2 emissions, through legislation and or regulation. Although the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined at this time, mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. Clean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the CWA requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impact. In September 2004, the EPA adopted rules for existing facilities to minimize the potential adverse impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the 316(b) rules for Wisconsin Electrics Oak Creek Power Plant, We Powers Oak Creek expansion and PWGS were included in project costs. In January 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found certain portions of the rule impermissible, including portions that permitted approval of water intake system technologies based on a cost benefit analysis, and remanded several parts of the rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit regarding the use of cost benefit analysis and held that it was permissible for the EPA to rely on cost benefit analysis in setting national performance standards and in providing variances from those standards. The Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. 68 Until the EPA completes its reconsideration and rulemaking, we cannot predict what impact these changes may have on our facilities. The decision will not affect the new units at the Oak Creek expansion, because those units were permitted based on a BTA decision under the Phase I rule for new facilities. In addition, in December 2009, the EPA published its determination that revision of the current effluent guidelines for steam electric generating units was warranted, and proposed a rulemaking process to adopt such revisions by 2013. Revisions to the current effluent guidelines are expected to result in more stringent standards that may result in the installation of additional controls. Until the EPA completes its rulemaking process, however, we cannot predict what impact these new standards may have on our facilities. Other Environmental Matters: Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note S Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LEGAL MATTERS Cash Balance Pension Plan: On June 30, 2009, a lawsuit was filed by a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Counsel representing the plaintiff is attempting to seek class certification for other similarly situated plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of ERISA and are owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. We believe the Plan correctly calculated the lump sum distributions. An adverse outcome of this lawsuit could affect our Plan funding and expense. We are currently unable to predict the final outcome or impact of this litigation. Settlement with the Mines: In May 2007, Wisconsin Electric entered into a settlement agreement with our largest customers, two iron ore mines, related to an arbitration proceeding over disputed billings arising from the special negotiated contracts the mines operated under until they expired in December 2007. The settlement was a full and complete resolution of all claims and disputes between the parties for electric service rendered by Wisconsin Electric under the power purchase agreements through March 31, 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, the mines paid Wisconsin Electric approximately $9.0 million and Wisconsin Electric released to the mines all funds it was holding in escrow. The estimated earnings impact of the payment from the mines was $0.04 per share, which was recorded in 2007. Beginning in January 2008, the mines began receiving electric service from Wisconsin Electric in accordance with tariffs approved by the MPSC. Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services. In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." 69 In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. We do not believe the lawsuit has merit and we will vigorously defend the case. This lawsuit is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. In June 2007, another stray voltage lawsuit was settled. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Point Beach Nuclear Plant: Wisconsin Electric previously owned two electric generating units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) at Point Beach in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. In September 2007, Wisconsin Electric sold Point Beach to an affiliate of FPL for approximately $924 million. For additional information on this sale, see Corporate Strategy at the beginning of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. A long term power purchase agreement with the buyer became effective upon closing of the sale. Pursuant to this agreement, Wisconsin Electric is purchasing all of the energy produced by Point Beach. The power purchase agreement extends through 2030 for Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2. Based on the agreement, we are paying a pre determined price per MWh for energy delivered according to a schedule that is established in the agreement. Under the agreement, if our credit rating and the credit rating of Wisconsin Electric f rom either S&P or Moodys fall below investment grade, or if the holders of any indebtedness in excess of $100.0 million accelerate or have the right to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness as a result of a default, we would need to provide collateral in the amount of $100.0 million (escalating at 3% per year commencing in 2024). Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the NRC in December 2005. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach. In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. We anticipate that the DOE will appeal this decision, and that any recoveries will be included in future rate cases. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended federal energy laws and provided FERC with new oversight responsibilities. 70 Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years. These issues include: Addition of generating capacity in the state; Modifications to the regulatory process to facilitate development of merchant generating plants; Development of a regional independent electric transmission system operator; Improvements to existing and addition of new electric transmission lines in the state; and Addition of renewable generation. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Electric Transmission and Energy Markets In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and a relatively new ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by LSEs located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. In February 2008, FERC issued several orders confirming the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. In October 2009, FERC issued an order related to the allocation of costs for network transmission upgrades. As a condition of this order, MISO is expected to submit a filing by July 15, 2010 to replace the current cost allocation methodology. In April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of RSG charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints. In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC. In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through 71 March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time. As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should adequately mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for U.S. registrants that, if adopted, would require U.S. companies to follow IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC guidelines, in their current form, would require us to adopt IFRS in 2014. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments: 72 Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense. The actions of our regulators may also require us to accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2009, we had $1,251.4 million in regulatory assets and $1,109.5 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under regulatory accounting, may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. The following chart reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. Pension Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.7 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.8 In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note O Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decr eased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes. The following chart reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. 73 OPEB Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.3 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years ($2.8) 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.0 Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2009 of approximately $4.1 billion included accrued utility revenues of $290.4 million as of Dec ember 31, 2009. ITEM 7A.
