ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS INTRODUCTION Wisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non utility energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries. Our utility energy segment primarily consists of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies." We generate and distribute electricity in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we distribute natural gas in Wisconsin. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric under our PTF strategy. CORPORATE STRATEGY Business Opportunities We have three primary investment opportunities and earnings streams: our regulated utility business; our investment in ATC; and our generation plants within our non utility energy segment. Our regulated utility business consists of electric generation assets and the electric and gas distribution assets that serve the electric and gas customers of We Energies. During 2010, our regulated utility earned $564.0 million of operating income. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $2.0 billion in this business to construct renewable energy generation and environmental control equipment and to update the electric and gas distribution infrastructure. We have a $330.5 million investment in ATC, which represents a 26.2% ownership interest. Our 2010 pre tax earnings from ATC totaled $60.1 million and we received $49.3 million in dividends from ATC. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $20 million in ATC as it continues to upgrade the transmission infrastructure within Wisconsin. Our non utility energy segment consists primarily of the generation plants constructed as part of our PTF initiative. As of December 31, 2010, three of the four plants have been placed in service and are being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long term leases that run for 25 years (PWGS 1 and PWGS 2) and 30 years (OC 1). OC 2 was placed in service on January 12, 2011, and is being leased to Wisconsin Electric under a long term lease that runs for 30 years. We recognize revenues on a levelized basis over the life of the lease. During 2011, we expect this segments operating income to be between $340 million and $350 million. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $88 million in this segment. 40 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS The following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2010, 2009 and 2008: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $564.0 $550.9 $576.5 Non Utility Energy 252.4 120.1 89.3 Corporate and Other (6.0) (10.7) (10.6) Total Operating Income 810.4 660.3 655.2 Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliate 60.1 59.1 51.8 Other Income and Deductions, net 40.2 28.5 16.9 Interest Expense, net 206.4 156.7 153.7 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 704.3 591.2 570.2 Income Taxes 249.9 215.5 215.1 Income From Continuing Operations 454.4 375.7 355.1 Income From Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 2.1 6.7 4.0 Net Income $456.5 $382.4 $359.1 Diluted Earnings Per Share Continuing Operations $3.84 $3.19 $3.00 Discontinued Operations 0.02 0.05 0.04 Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $3.86 $3.24 $3.04 An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results follow. UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2010 vs. 2009: Our utility energy segment contributed $564.0 million of operating income during 2010 compared with $550.9 million of operating income during 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by favorable weather during 2010, partially offset by unfavorable recoveries of revenues associated with fuel and purchased power in 2010. During 2010, we experienced unfavorable fuel recoveries of approximately $44 million. During 2009, we experienced favorable fuel recoveries of approximately $19 million. 2009 vs. 2008: Our utility energy segment contributed $550.9 million of operating income during 2009 compared with $576.5 million of operating income during 2008. The most significant factors that impacted operating income during 2009 were less favorable weather during the spring and summer months and a decline in economic conditions throughout 2009, both of which decreased electric sales. However, we experienced a decrease in fuel and purchased power costs largely due to lower MWh sales and a decrease in operating and maintenance expense during 2009 as compared to 2008. 41 The following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2010, 2009 and 2008: Utility Energy Segment 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues Electric $2,936.3 $2,685.0 $2,660.6 Gas 1,190.2 1,367.9 1,694.6 Other 38.8 39.1 40.3 Total Operating Revenues 4,165.3 4,092.0 4,395.5 Fuel and Purchased Power 1,104.7 1,064.5 1,242.3 Cost of Gas Sold 751.5 912.0 1,220.9 Gross Margin 2,309.1 2,115.5 1,932.3 Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 1,587.0 1,372.3 1,437.1 Depreciation and Amortization 251.4 313.1 300.9 Property and Revenue Taxes 105.1 109.9 105.9 Total Operating Expenses 3,799.7 3,771.8 4,307.1 Amortization of Gain 198.4 230.7 488.1 Operating Income $564.0 $550.9 $576.5 Electric Utility Gross Margin The following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2010 with similar information for 2009 and 2008, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh Sales Electric Utility Operations 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $1,114.3 $977.6 $962.5 8,426.3 7,949.3 8,277.1 Small Commercial/Industrial 922.2 860.3 869.7 8,823.3 8,571.6 9,023.7 Large Commercial/Industrial 677.1 599.4 646.3 9,961.5 9,140.3 10,691.7 Other Retail 21.9 21.2 20.8 155.3 156.5 161.5 Total Retail 2,735.5 2,458.5 2,499.3 27,366.4 25,817.7 28,154.0 Wholesale Other 134.6 116.7 77.7 2,004.6 1,529.4 2,620.7 Resale Utilities 40.4 47.5 37.7 1,103.8 1,548.9 881.0 Other Operating Revenues 25.8 62.3 45.9 Total 2,936.3 2,685.0 2,660.6 30,474.8 28,896.0 31,655.7 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 570.5 518.3 570.6 Purchased Power 521.0 533.8 658.5 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,091.5 1,052.1 1,229.1 Total Electric Gross Margin $1,844.8 $1,632.9 $1,431.5 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,612 Normal) 6,183 6,825 7,073 Cooling (698 Normal) 944 475 593 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average. 42 Electric Utility Revenues and Sales 2010 vs. 2009: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $251.3 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2009. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were: Net pricing increases totaling $121.0 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders that became effective in 2010. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. Favorable weather that increased electric revenues by an estimated $103.4 million as compared to 2009. Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $43.0 million as compared to 2009. 2010 pricing increases totaling approximately $32.3 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. For information on the bill credits, see Amortization of Gain below. As measured by cooling degree days, 2010 was 98.7% warmer than the same period in 2009 and 35.2% warmer than normal. Collectively, retail sales to our residential and small commercial and industrial customers, who are more weather sensitive, increased by 4.4%. Sales to our large commercial and industrial customers increased by 9.0% during 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily because of an improving economy. Electric sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, which represent approximately 6.9% of our annual sales, increased significantly for the year. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial and industrial customers increased by 3.2% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The $36.5 million decline in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2010 as compared to 2009. We currently estimate that 2011 electric revenues will increase because of the completion of the Point Beach bill credits and an increase in revenues related to increased fuel costs. However, we would expect residential and small commercial and industrial sales to decrease if we experience normal weather. 2009 vs. 2008: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $24.4 million, or 0.9%, when compared to 2008. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were: 2009 pricing increases totaling approximately $109.9 million reflecting the reduction of Point Beach credits to retail customers. A one time FERC approved refund to our wholesale customers in 2008 associated with their share of the gain on the sale of Point Beach that reduced 2008 wholesale revenues by $62.5 million. Net pricing increases totaling approximately $20.4 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders. Unfavorable weather that reduced electric revenues by an estimated $35.3 million as compared to 2008. A slowdown in the economy that reduced commercial and industrial sales by an estimated $129.0 million and wholesale sales by an estimated $30.9 million. Our total electric sales volumes decreased by approximately 8.7% as compared to 2008 due almost exclusively to a continued decline in economic conditions, which primarily affected our commercial and industrial sales, and milder weather, which primarily affected our residential sales. Total retail sales volumes declined approximately 8.3%. Of the 8.3% decline in retail sales, approximately 7.1% relates to sales volumes at our small and large commercial and industrial customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2009 was 19.9% cooler than 2008 and 31.9% cooler than normal. The $16.4 million increase in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2009 as compared to 2008. 43 Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses 2010 vs. 2009: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $39.4 million, or approximately 3.7%, when compared to 2009. This increase was primarily caused by a 5.5% increase in MWh sales, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in the average cost/MWh between periods. The average cost/MWh was comparable between periods because of a 7.7% increase in generation from our lower cost coal units and a 16.5% decrease in the cost of natural gas used at the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS), which was sufficient to offset the impact of a 5.7% increase in coal and related transportation costs and the increase in gas generation and purchased power utilized as a result of the increased sales. We expect electric fuel and purchased power expenses to increase in 2011 because of changes in the price of natural gas and in the cost of coal and related transportation prices. 2009 vs. 2008: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs decreased by $177.0 million, or approximately 14.4%, when compared to 2008. This decline was primarily caused by lower MWh sales and lower natural gas and purchased power prices, partially offset by higher coal and related transportation costs. Approximately $41.2 million of this decrease related to the one time amortization of deferred fuel costs recorded in the first quarter of 2008 pursuant to the January 2008 PSCW rate order. Adjusted for the one time amortization, our electric fuel and purchased power costs decreased by $135.8 million, or 11.0%. Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm Deliveries The following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2010, 2009 and 2008: Gas Utility Operations 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,190.2 $1,367.9 $1,694.6 Cost of Gas Sold 751.5 912.0 1,220.9 Gross Margin $438.7 $455.9 $473.7 We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2010, 2009 and 2008: Gross Margin Therm Deliveries Gas Utility Operations 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days) Customer Class Residential $282.2 $291.5 $299.5 741.2 803.4 841.8 Commercial/Industrial 95.8 104.6 109.3 429.6 479.4 503.2 Interruptible 2.2 2.0 2.4 19.4 19.1 23.0 Total Retail 380.2 398.1 411.2 1,190.2 1,301.9 1,368.0 Transported Gas 51.3 49.6 52.2 914.9 882.0 905.8 Other Operating 7.2 8.2 10.3 Total $438.7 $455.9 $473.7 2,105.1 2,183.9 2,273.8 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,612 Normal) 6,183 6,825 7,073 (a) As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average. 44 2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal. We expect our 2011 gas margin to be impacted by weather; however, as noted above, 2010 was warmer than normal. 2009 vs. 2008: Our gas margin decreased by $17.8 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2008. We estimate that milder winter weather and a decline in economic conditions caused margins to decrease by approximately $14.4 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. As measured by heating degree days, 2009 was 3.5% warmer than 2008, but 2.8% colder than normal. Other Operation and Maintenance Expense 2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs. Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2011 other operation and maintenance expenses to increase slightly because of inflation related items. 2009 vs. 2008: Our other operation and maintenance expense decreased by $64.8 million, or approximately 4.5%, when compared to 2008. The largest factor for this decrease relates to a $43.8 million one time amortization of deferred bad debt costs in 2008 pursuant to the January 2008 PSCW rate order. The January 2008 PSCW rate order, which was in effect for all of 2009, allowed for pricing increases related to transmission costs, PTF lease costs and the amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $15.9 million higher in 2009 as compared to 2008. The remaining decrease is primarily related to reduced operating and maintenance expenses at our power plants and electric distribution system. Depreciation and Amortization Expense 2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2011 as a result of an overall increase in utility plant in service. 2009 vs. 2008: Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $12.2 million, or approximately 4.1%, when compared to 2008. This increase was the result of higher depreciation related to new capital projects placed in service, including the Blue Sky Green Field wind project which was placed in service in May 2008. 45 Amortization of Gain In connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached agreements with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits are being returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it is being amortized to the income statement as we issue bill credits or make refunds to customers. When the bill credits and refunds are issued to customers, we transfer cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Amortization of Gain was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Bill Credits Retail $198.4 $230.7 $340.6 One Time FERC Refund 62.5 One Time Amortization to Offset Regulatory Asset 85.0 Total Amortization of Gain $198.4 $230.7 $488.1 All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach have been applied to customers as of December 31, 2010. NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME Our non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively. The table below reflects: A full years earnings for 2010, 2009 and 2008 for PWGS 1; A full years earnings for 2010 and 2009 and approximately seven months of earnings for 2008 for PWGS 2; A full years earnings for 2010, 2009 and 2008 for the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; A full years earnings for 2010 and 2009 for the water intake system for the Oak Creek expansion; and Approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1. This segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense. The operating and maintenance costs associated with the plants are the responsibility of Wisconsin Electric and are recorded in the utility segment. Year Ended December 31, 2010 (Millions of Dollars) Port Washington Oak Creek Expansion All Other Total Operating Revenues $104.6 $203.3 $12.3 $320.2 Operation and Maintenance Expense 0.8 4.7 8.8 14.3 Depreciation Expense 19.8 32.0 1.7 53.5 Operating Income $84.0 $166.6 $1.8 $252.4 46 Year Ended December 31, 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Port Washington Oak Creek Expansion All Other Total Operating Revenues $104.8 $48.0 $10.3 $163.1 Operation and Maintenance Expense 0.9 5.2 7.7 13.8 Depreciation Expense 19.8 7.8 1.6 29.2 Operating Income $84.1 $35.0 $1.0 $120.1 Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Port Washington Oak Creek Expansion All Other Total Operating Revenues $84.0 $30.5 $11.7 $126.2 Operation and Maintenance Expense 1.0 5.9 8.1 15.0 Depreciation Expense 15.8 4.5 1.6 21.9 Operating Income $67.2 $20.1 $2.0 $89.3 In 2011, we expect our non utility energy segment to continue to generate higher operating income because OC 2 went into service on January 12, 2011. CORPORATE AND OTHER CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOME 2010 vs. 2009: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $6.0 million in 2010 compared with an operating loss of $10.7 million in 2009. This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 2009 vs. 2008: Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10.7 million in 2009 compared with an operating loss of $10.6 million in 2008. CONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NET Other Income and Deductions, net 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $32.5 $16.0 $7.8 Gain on Property Sales 4.4 1.7 2.6 Other, net 3.3 10.8 6.5 Total Other Income and Deductions, net $40.2 $28.5 $16.9 2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009. This increase primarily relates to increased AFUDC Equity related to the construction of the Oak Creek Air Quality Control System (AQCS) project. During 2011, we expect to see an increase in AFUDC Equity with the continued construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. 2009 vs. 2008: Other income and deductions, net increased by $11.6 million when compared to 2008 primarily due to higher interest income and an increase in AFUDC Equity related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project. 47 CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Interest Expense, net 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Interest Costs $258.7 $235.4 $240.3 Less: Capitalized Interest 52.3 78.7 86.6 Interest Expense, net $206.4 $156.7 $153.7 2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. During 2011, we expect interest expense, net to increase because we will no longer be capitalizing interest expense related to OC 2 as it was placed into service in January 2011. In addition, in January 2011, we issued $420.0 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay the short term borrowings that we incurred during the construction of OC 2. 2009 vs. 2008: Interest expense, net increased by $3.0 million during 2009 when compared with 2008. Our gross interest costs decreased by $4.9 million and our capitalized interest decreased by $7.9 million primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower capital expenditures. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAXES 2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. For further information see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2011 annual effective tax rate to range between 35.0% and 36.0%. 2009 vs. 2008: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 36.5% in 2009 compared to 37.7% in 2008. This reduction in our effective tax rate was the result of tax credits associated with wind production. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOWS The following table summarizes our cash flows during 2010, 2009 and 2008: Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $810.4 $628.9 $736.3 Investing Activities ($633.5) ($736.1) ($906.3) Financing Activities ($172.6) $95.7 $175.0 48 Operating Activities 2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010. 2009 vs. 2008: Cash provided by operating activities was $628.9 million during 2009, which was $107.4 million lower than 2008. Although we experienced an increase in net income and depreciation during 2009, our operating cash flows declined because of the $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. This amount is compared to approximately $48.4 million contributed to our qualified benefit plans in 2008. Investing Activities 2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault. The following table identifies capital expenditures by year: Capital Expenditures 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $687.0 $547.0 $604.2 We Power 109.3 253.2 529.3 Other 1.9 14.4 0.4 Total Capital Expenditures $798.2 $814.6 $1,133.9 2009 vs. 2008: Cash used in investing activities was $736.1 million during 2009, which was $170.2 million lower than the same period in 2008. This decline primarily reflects lower capital expenditures and cash flows from the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits during 2009. During 2009, our capital expenditures decreased by $319.3 million, primarily due to the reduction in capital expenditures for OC 1 and OC 2 and the completion of PWGS 2 in 2008. During 2009, we released $153.1 million less from restricted cash as compared to the same period in 2008. In September 2007, we sold Point Beach and placed approximately $924 million of cash in restricted accounts to be used for the payment of taxes and for the benefit of our customers. We release the restricted cash, adjusted for taxes, as we issue bill credits to our customers, which is reflected as an amortization of the gain on our income statement. Financing Activities The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt $71.1 $263.2 $316.8 Dividends on Common Stock (187.0) (157.8) (126.3) Common Stock, Net (65.7) (12.6) (11.4) Other 9.0 2.9 (4.1) Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing ($172.6) $95.7 $175.0 49 2010 vs. 2009: Cash used for financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million in long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issues, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a 30.0% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend. 2009 vs. 2008: Cash provided by financing activities during 2009 was $95.7 million, compared to $175.0 million during the same period in 2008. During 2009, we issued a total of $261.5 million in long term debt and retired $74.1 million of long term debt. Substantially all of the net proceeds were used to repay short term debt. During 2009, we paid approximately $157.8 million in cash dividends and Wisconsin Electric repurchased $147 million of outstanding tax exempt bonds in August 2009. Our common stock dividends increased in 2009 as we raised our dividend rate by 25%. No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2010, 2009 or 2008. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 2.9 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million, 0.7 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million and 0.5 million shares at a cost of $23.0 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we received proceeds of $90.9 million, $17.0 million and $11.6 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS Working Capital As of December 31, 2010, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $390.0 million. This negative working capital balance is primarily the result of financing the construction of OC 2, as well as our new renewable generation and environmental upgrades, with significant amounts of short term debt. OC 2 was placed in service on January 12, 2011. In January 2011, we issued $420.0 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. This transaction significantly improved our working capital position. Liquidity We anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2011 primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. Beyond 2011, we anticipate meeting our capital requirements through internally generated funds supplemented, when required, by short term borrowings and the issuance of debt securities. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash. Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. 50 As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $657.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2010, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2010: Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $1.1 $448.9 December 2013 Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $3.4 $496.6 December 2013 Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013 On December 20, 2010, Wisconsin Energy entered into an unsecured three year $450 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $900 million credit facility with an expiration date of April 2011. This new facility will expire in December 2013. On December 20, 2010, Wisconsin Electric entered into an unsecured three year $500 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $500 million five year credit facility with an expiration date of March 2011. This new facility will expire in December 2013. On December 20, 2010, Wisconsin Gas entered into an unsecured three year $300 million bank back up credit facility to replace a $300 million five year credit facility with an expiration date of March 2011. This new facility will expire in December 2013. Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval. The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 2010 2009 Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,802.1 $4,052.1 $3,566.9 $3,816.9 Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4 Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,405.4 4,155.4 4,171.5 3,921.5 Short Term Debt 657.9 657.9 825.1 825.1 Total Capitalization $8,895.8 $8,895.8 $8,593.9 $8,593.9 Total Debt $5,063.3 $4,813.3 $4,996.6 $4,746.6 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 56.9% 54.1% 58.1% 55.2% Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes. 51 The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure. As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations. Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2010, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties. Bonus Depreciation Provisions In December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2011 and 2012. As a result of this change in law, we anticipate that certain projects will benefit from the increased bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012. We estimate $100 million in cash benefits from bonus depreciation in 2011 and $200 million in 2012. Credit Rating Risk We do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2010, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payment required under these agreements totaled approximately $201.6 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties. In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets. In October 2010, Moodys affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). In November 2010, Moodys downgraded the long term debt ratings of Wisconsin Electric (senior unsecured to A2 from A1; commercial paper, P 1), Wisconsin Gas (senior unsecured to A2 from A1; commercial paper, P 1) and ERGSS (senior notes to A2 from A1). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and ERGSS. In July 2010, S&P affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), WECC (senior unsecured, BBB+) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ) and the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company. 52 In June 2010, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), WECC (senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A+). Fitch also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric, WECC and ERGSS from negative to stable. The ratings outlook of Wisconsin Gas did not change and remains stable. Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency. Capital Requirements Capital Expenditures: Our estimated 2011, 2012 and 2013 capital expenditures are as follows: Capital Expenditures 2011 2012 2013 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Renewable $332.9 $131.9 $10.4 Environmental 165.5 67.5 71.1 Base Spending 415.4 425.6 411.8 Total Utility 913.8 625.0 493.3 We Power 31.7 12.6 39.4 Other 5.7 18.5 3.7 Total $951.2 $656.1 $536.4 Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. In January 2009, we contributed $270 million to our qualified pension plan due to poor investment returns during 2008. We did not make contributions to the plan during 2010 as it was adequately funded. In January 2011, we contributed $101.4 million to our qualified pension plans. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 53 Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $7,707.6 $692.2 $822.2 $1,063.6 $5,129.6 Capital Lease Obligations (c) 332.8 37.5 79.4 85.4 130.5 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 86.2 22.8 22.8 7.9 32.7 Purchase Obligations (e) 12,925.7 1,031.8 1,483.1 938.5 9,472.3 Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 97.6 97.6 Total Contractual Obligations $21,149.9 $1,881.9 $2,407.5 $2,095.4 $14,765.1 (a) The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates. (b) Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations). For the purpose of determining our contractual obligations and commercial commitments only, we assumed the Junior Notes would be retired in 2017 with the proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities pursuant to the terms of the RCC. (c) Capital Lease Obligations of Wisconsin Electric for power purchase commitments. (d) Operating Lease Obligations for power purchase commitments and vehicle and rail car leases. (e) Purchase Obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and We Power operations. This includes the power purchase agreement for all of the energy produced by Point Beach. (f) Other Long Term Liabilities includes the expected 2011 supplemental executive retirement plan obligation. For additional information on employer contributions to our benefit plans, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes. For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS We are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to: Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of 54 these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs. Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. If cumulative fuel and purchased power costs for electric utility operations deviate from a prescribed range (plus or minus 2% for 2010) when compared to the costs projected in the most recent retail rate proceeding, retail electric rates may be adjusted prospectively. Beginning in 2011, the PSCW has implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2% for 2011). Under the rules, any fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. The PSCW has authorized dollar for dollar recovery for the majority of natural gas costs for our gas utility operations through GCRMs, which mitigates most of the risk of gas cost variations. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution. In March 2005, the PSCW authorized the use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allowing for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As part of the January 2010 PSCW rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2011. As a result of GCRMs, our gas distribution subsidiaries receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. Weather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2010, 2009 and 2008, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations. Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels. 55 We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2010 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2010, we had $657.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.30% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $6.6 million before taxes from commercial paper and by $1.5 million before taxes from variable rate long term debt outstanding. Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators. The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2010 was approximately: Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,059.5 Other post retirement benefits trust funds $216.7 The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and other post retirement benefit plans for 2011. Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers. We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund. Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations. For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 56 POWER THE FUTURE As of January 12, 2011, all of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units: Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $ 333 million PWGS 2 May 2008 $ 331 million OC 1 February 2010 $ 1,355 million OC 2 January 2011 $ 668 million (a) Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage. We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and will request authorization from the MPSC with the next rate case. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation. Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively. PWGS consists of two 545 MW natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The Oak Creek expansion is located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The total cost for the two units was set at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $191 million, or 8.7%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is $162 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provide for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and impose liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays result from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages. ERGSS is entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel is responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 57 For information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows: PWGS 1 & PWGS 2 Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms. OC 1 & OC 2 Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates; Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule; Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt; Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity; Recovery of carrying costs during construction; and Ongoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms. WPDES Permit: In order to resolve all outstanding challenges to the Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit issued by the WDNR in connection with the Oak Creek expansion, a settlement agreement was reached with Clean Wisconsin, Inc. and Sierra Club, in which we committed to contribute our share of $5 million (approximately $4.2 million) towards projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also agreed (i) for the 25 year period ending 2034, subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to contribute our share of up to $4 million per year (approximately $3.3 million) to fund projects to address Lake Michigan water quality, and (ii) subject to regulatory approval and cost recovery, to develop new solar and biomass generation projects. We also agreed to support state legislation to increase the renewable portfolio standard to 10% by 2013 and 25% by 2025, and to retire 116 MW of coal fired generation at our Presque Isle Power Plant. In its December 2009 decision, based upon a proposal submitted by the parties to the settlement agreement, the PSCW authorized recovery of $2.0 million per year for 2010 and 2011 related to costs associated with projects to address Lake Michigan water quality and recovery of $2.0 million of the second $2.5 million payment related to projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based upon this decision, the parties are proceeding to carry out the settlement agreement. We are responsible for our pro rata share of these payments. UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS The PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 87% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. We anticipate filing a rate case in 2011 for rates effective in January 2012. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/. 58 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%. In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million. In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments: An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%; A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric; An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; and A decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers. These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%. The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations: New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case; Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; and Wisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs currently embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $6 million. The net increase of $32.4 million is being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. We expect to receive approval for the increased rates in the first quarter of 2011. 2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined 59 total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. On November 12, 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. On December 28, 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. 2008 Wisconsin Rate Increase: During 2007, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings. In January 2008, the PSCW approved pricing increases for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas as follows: $389.1 million (17.2%) in electric rates for Wisconsin Electric the pricing increase was offset by bill credits in 2008 and 2009; $4.0 million (0.6%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Electric; $3.6 million (11.2%) for steam service from Wisconsin Electric; and $20.1 million (2.2%) for natural gas service from Wisconsin Gas. In addition, the PSCW lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas from 11.2% to 10.75%. The PSCW also determined that $85.0 million of the Point Beach proceeds should be immediately applied to offset certain regulatory assets. 2008 Michigan Rate Increase: In January 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a rate increase request with the MPSC. This request represented an increase in electric rates of 14.7%, or $22.0 million, to support the growing demand for electricity, continued investment in renewable programs, compliance with environmental regulations, addition of distribution infrastructure and increased operational expenses. In November 2008, a settlement agreement with the MPSC staff and intervenors for a rate increase of $7.2 million, or 4.6%, was approved by the MPSC, effective January 1, 2009. Limited Rate Adjustment Requests 2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. The revenues that we collect are subject to refund with interest at a rate of 10.4%. We expect PSCW review and final approval in the first quarter of 2011. 2009 Fuel Order: Wisconsin Electric operates under a fuel cost adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation of electricity for its retail customers in Wisconsin. Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding. In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009. The PSCW staff is currently auditing the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency 60 fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. The PSCW staff issued for comment a memorandum detailing different alternatives for calculating excess revenues. We do not believe the amount to be refunded to customers, if any, should be material. We anticipate a decision in this matter in the first quarter of 2011. Other Utility Rate Matters Oak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $780 million ($910 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA. Michigan Legislation: During October 2008, Michigan enacted legislation to make significant changes in regulatory procedures, which should provide for more timely cost recovery. Public Act 286 allows the use of a forward looking test year in rate cases rather than historical data, and allows us to put interim rates into effect six months after filing a complete case. Rate filings for which an order is not issued within 12 months are deemed approved. In addition, we could seek a CPCN for new investment, and could recover interest on the investment during construction. Public Act 286 also gives the MPSC expanded authority over proposed mergers and acquisitions, and requires action within 180 days of filing. Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. Under the fuel rules prior to January 1, 2011, no adjustments were made to rates under the fuel cost adjustment clause as long as fuel and purchased power costs were expected to be within a band of the costs embedded in current rates for the 12 month period ending December 31. If, however, annual fuel costs were expected to fall outside of the band, and actual costs fell outside of established fuel bands, then we could file for a change in fuel recoveries on a prospective basis. In April 2010, the Wisconsin legislature passed the Fuel Rule Bill, and the Governor signed it in May 2010. This bill instructed the PSCW to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. In August 2010, the PSCW proposed new fuel rules pursuant to this legislation, which the Wisconsin legislature reviewed and sent back to the PSCW for additional rule making. In December 2010, the PSCW revised the proposed rules as requested by the legislature and sent the revised rules back to the legislature for review. The new fuel rules are now in effect and fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 will be subject to the new rules. Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2010, we had deferred $138.0 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs. Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. Prior to 2010, there was an incentive mechanism under the GCRMs that allowed for increased revenues if we acquired gas at prices lower than benchmarks approved by the PSCW. However, as part of the January 2010 PSCW rate 61 order, the PSCW approved changing from an incentive method to a modified one for one method. The new method does not have revenue sharing. The GCRMs measure commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin. Bad Debt Costs: In March 2005, the PSCW approved our use of escrow accounting for residential bad debt costs. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds amounts allowed in rates. As part of the January 2010 PSCW rate order, the escrow accounting method for bad debt costs was extended through December 31, 2011. Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates. Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2010, our renewable energy percentage is at 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has developed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of seeking permits and approvals for approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. Assuming the additional wind generation currently under construction and the proposed biomass project is approved and completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2015. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 500 MW of additional renewable generating capacity by 2020. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation. Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels. Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the Wisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.2% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs. The funding required by Act 141 increased to 1.5% of annual operating revenues in 2011 and is scheduled to increase to 1.9% in 2012. 62 Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective. Renewable Energy Portfolio: In May 2008, the Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, reached commercial operation. In July 2008, we completed the purchase of rights to a new wind farm site in Central Wisconsin, Glacier Hills Wind Park, and filed a request for a CPCN with the PSCW in October 2008. The PSCW approved the CPCN in January 2010. We currently expect to install 90 wind turbines with a total generating capacity of approximately 162 MW. This project is expected to cost between $360 million and $370 million, excluding AFUDC. Construction commenced in May 2010, and we anticipate 2012 will be the first full year of operation. In September 2009, we announced plans to construct a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. We believe the biomass plant will be eligible for the federal production tax credit. We currently expect to invest approximately $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and for it to be completed during the fall of 2013, subject to regulatory and other approvals. In March 2010, we filed a request for a Certificate of Authority for the project with the PSCW. We anticipate a decision from the PSCW during the first quarter of 2011. Edgewater Generating Unit 5: During the fourth quarter of 2009, we reached a contingent agreement to sell our 25% interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 to WPL for our net book value, including working capital. In March 2010, the agreement became effective and we are in the process of receiving regulatory approvals. We received approval for the sale from FERC in June 2010, and from the PSCW in November 2010. We are currently working with the MPSC to obtain approval on terms that are acceptable to us. Assuming completion of the sale, we expect to realize proceeds of between $40 million and $45 million depending on the working capital balances and our level of capital investment in the unit prior to the sale. The contractual deadline to complete the sale is June 30, 2011. ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY In response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy. We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2010 and 2009. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2011. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures. 63 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as CO2, SO2, NOx, fine particulates and mercury; (2) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (3) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites. We are currently pursuing a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) improving our overall energy portfolio by adding more efficient generation as part of our PTF strategy; (2) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (3) reviewing water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water requirements; (4) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (5) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (6) evaluating and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems; (7) continuing the beneficial re use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (8) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites. Air Quality 8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. States were required to develop and submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to the EPA by June 2007 to demonstrate how they intended to comply with the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. Instead of submitting a SIP, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate all counties in southeastern Wisconsin as in attainment with the standard. In addition to the request for redesignation, Wisconsin also adopted the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rule that applies to emissions from our power plants in the affected areas of Wisconsin. Compliance with the NOx emission reduction requirements under the Consent Decree has substantially mitigated costs to comply with the RACT rule. In March 2008, the EPA issued a determination that the state of Wisconsin had failed to submit a SIP. In a separate action in May 2008, the EPA redesignated one of the 10 counties, Kewaunee County, as in attainment. In September 2009, Wisconsin submitted a SIP to the EPA. Based on our review of this submittal, we do not believe we would be subject to any further requirements to reduce emissions. In July 2010, the EPA redesignated an additional two counties, Manitowoc and Door, as in attainment. Although the EPA has yet to take action on redesignation of the remaining 7 counties due to continuing issues related to a portion of the SIP, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) RACT rules, that do not apply to our facilities, it issued a finding of attainment in December 2010 for the remaining 7 counties in southeastern Wisconsin. In order for the EPA to redesignate these counties, the state must revise, submit and receive EPA approval of revised VOC RACT rules. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected 7 counties. In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. In a December 2010 motion, the EPA asked that the litigation challenging the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) be set aside. The EPA indicates that it now expects to complete its reconsideration rulemaking by July 29, 2011. Although it is likely that additional counties, including the 10 in southeastern Wisconsin discussed above, may be designated as non attainment areas under the revised standard, until those designations become final and until any potential additional rules are adopted, we are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities. Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2004, the EPA designated Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) non attainment areas. All counties in Wisconsin and all counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were designated as in attainment with the standard. In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard became effective; however, on February 24, 2009 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. The Courts decision will likely result in an even more stringent annual PM2.5 standard. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in 64 southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has until 2012 to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements cannot be determined at this time. Similarly, until the EPA revises the 2006 standard consistent with the courts decision and the states develop rules and submit SIPs to the EPA to demonstrate how they intend to comply with that standard, we are unable to predict the impact of this more restrictive standard on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, if modifications to an existing facility would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions, we would potentially need to obtain an air pollution control construction permit, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. Sulfur Dioxide Standard: The EPA adopted its final rule revising the NAAQS for SO2. The rule became effective August 23, 2010. If the revised standard results in the designation of new non attainment areas, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our facilities in those areas. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted. Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted. Clean Air Interstate Rule: The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005 to facilitate the states in meeting the 8 hour ozone and Fine Particulate Matter standards by addressing the regional transport of SO2 and NOx. In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit invalidated several aspects of CAIR and remanded the rule to the EPA to promulgate a replacement rule. In July 2010, the EPA proposed a Transport Rule to replace CAIR. The proposed Transport Rule, like CAIR, would establish individual state caps for the emissions of SO2 and NOX from electric generating units in the eastern half of the United States, including Michigan and Wisconsin. The CAIR is in effect as of 2009 for NOx and 2010 for SO2, but will be replaced with the new requirements of the Transport Rule, if adopted. The Transport Rule may require new reductions in 2012 for NOx and SO2 and additional reductions in 2014 for SO2 for some states, including Wisconsin and Michigan. According to the EPA, the Transport Rule and other actions by States is expected to result in a 71% reduction of SO2 and 52% reduction of NOx emissions from power plants in the eastern United States by 2014 from 2005 emission levels. We submitted comments on the proposed rule in October 2010. The EPA intends to finalize the rule in mid 2011. We previously determined that compliance with the NOx and SO2 emission reductions requirements under the Consent Decree entered into between the EPA and Wisconsin Electric in April 2003 would substantially mitigate costs to comply with CAIR and would achieve the levels necessary under at least the first phase of CAIR. The proposed limits under the Transport Rule appear to be more stringent and could result in the need for additional expenditures by 2014. Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: The EPA issued the final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) in March 2005, addressing mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants. The federal rule was challenged by a number of states including Wisconsin and Michigan. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated CAMR and sent the rule back to the EPA for reconsideration. 65 In December 2008, a number of environmental groups filed a complaint with the D.C. Circuit asking that the court place the EPA on a schedule for promulgating Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) limits for fossil fuel fired electric generating units to address hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. In October 2009, the EPA published notice of a proposed consent decree in connection with this litigation that would place the EPA on a schedule to set a MACT rule for coal and oil fired electric generating units in 2011. In April 2010, the D.C. District Court approved a settlement agreement between the EPA and the plaintiffs in the litigation setting a firm schedule for the remanded rule making. This settlement requires that the EPA issue a proposed rule by March 16, 2011 and a final rule by November 16, 2011. The EPA is currently in the process of developing the proposed MACT rule, which is expected to reduce emissions of numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities until a proposed and final rule is issued. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules in place. Both states require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs. Proposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing various scenarios for regulating coal combustion products including classifying them as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rule in November 2010. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program. Curtailing our program could result in the loss of a revenue stream that helps to offset the cost of pollution control equipment and the activities necessary to collect the coal combustion products. In addition, if coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company. Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. States were required to submit SIPs to implement CAVR by December 2007. Wisconsin has not yet submitted a SIP. Michigan submitted a SIP, which was partially approved. In response to a citizen suit, in January 2009, the EPA issued a finding of failure to 37 states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, regarding their failure to submit SIPs. The finding started a two year review window for the EPA to issue Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs), unless a state submits and receives SIP approval. Wisconsin has not yet released a SIP, nor made a SIP submittal to the EPA. Michigan submitted a complete SIP in November 2010. The EPA, however, has not yet taken any action to approve this SIP, nor issue a FIP to any states, including Michigan and Wisconsin. Wisconsin and Michigan have completed the BART rules, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations. Wisconsin BART rules became effective in July 2008 and Michigan BART rules became effective in September 2008. Both Wisconsin and Michigan BART rules are based, in part, on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. Therefore, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until the EPA completes a new rule, which it intends to finalize by mid 2011, pursuant to a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 66 EPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including: Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units. Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that will be the most thermally efficient coal units in our system. Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation. Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow&reg; renewable energy program. Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory restrictions on CO2 emissions continue to be considered in the U.S. Congress and by the EPA, and the President and his administration have made it clear that they are focused on reducing CO2 emissions, through legislation and or regulation. Although the ultimate outcome of these efforts cannot be determined at this time, mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. Clean Water Act Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impact. In September 2004, the EPA adopted rules for existing facilities to minimize the potential adverse impacts to aquatic organisms associated with water withdrawals from cooling water intakes. Costs associated with implementation of the 316(b) rules for Wisconsin Electrics Oak Creek Power Plant, We Powers Oak Creek expansion and PWGS were included in project costs. In January 2007, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found certain portions of the rule impermissible, including portions that permitted approval of water intake system technologies based on a cost benefit analysis, and remanded several parts of the rule to the EPA for further consideration or potential additional rulemaking. In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit regarding the use of cost benefit analysis and held that it was permissible for the EPA to rely on cost benefit analysis in setting national performance standards and in providing variances from those standards. The Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. On December 3, 2010, the Federal District Court in New York approved a settlement agreement between the EPA and Riverkeeper Inc. (plaintiff in the litigation) setting a firm schedule for the remanded Section 316(b) rulemaking. This settlement requires that the EPA issue a proposed rule by March 14, 2011 and a final rule by July 27, 2012. Until the EPA completes its reconsideration and rulemaking, we cannot predict what impact these changes may have on our facilities. The decision will not affect the new units at the Oak Creek expansion because those units were permitted based on a BTA decision under the Phase I rule for new facilities. 67 In December 2009, the EPA published its determination that revision of the current effluent guidelines for steam electric generating units was warranted, and proposed a rulemaking process to adopt such revisions by 2013. Revisions to the current effluent guidelines are expected to result in more stringent standards that may result in the installation of additional controls. Until the EPA completes its rulemaking process, however, we cannot predict what impact these new standards may have on our facilities. Other Environmental Matters Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. LEGAL MATTERS Cash Balance Pension Plan: On June 30, 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Counsel representing the plaintiff is attempting to seek class certification for other similarly situated plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and are owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. On September 6, 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy Corporation as a defendant. The plaintiff has not specified the amount of relief he is seeking. An adverse outcome of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on Plan funding and expense and our results of operations. Although we are currently unable to predict the final outcome or impact of this litigation, we are aware that courts in two similar lawsuits filed in Wisconsin found that the interest crediting rates applied by pension plans involved in those cases were not in compliance with ERISA. Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services. In recent years, dairy farmers have commenced actions or made claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of this case, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric on January 27, 2011. We do not believe these lawsuits have merit and we will vigorously defend them. These lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk. 68 NUCLEAR OPERATIONS Used Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005. Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach. In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we expect to receive in the first quarter of 2011. We anticipate that this amount, net of costs incurred, will be returned to customers in future rate cases. INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITION Electric Utility Industry The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended federal energy laws and provided FERC with new oversight responsibilities. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. 69 Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier. Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers. Electric Transmission and Energy Markets In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities (LSEs) located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. In February 2008, FERC issued several orders confirming the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. In April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints. In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC. In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 70 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time. As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. Natural Gas Utility Industry Restructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS New Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements. International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for U.S. registrants that, if adopted, would require U.S. companies to follow IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC guidelines, in their current form, would require us to adopt IFRS in 2014. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments: 71 Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense. The actions of our regulators may also require us to accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2010, we had $1,144.5 million in regulatory assets and $899.1 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, continued deferral of certain regulatory asset and liability amounts on the utilities books, as allowed under regulatory accounting, may no longer be appropriate and the unamortized regulatory assets net of the regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. The following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. Pension Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $6.0 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.4 In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes. 72 The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant. OPEB Plan Impact on Actuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.5 0.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years ($3.2) 0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.1 Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2010 of approximately $4.2 billion included accrued utility revenues of $280.3 million as of December 31, 2010. ITEM 7A.
