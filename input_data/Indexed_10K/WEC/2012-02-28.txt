ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCORPORATE DEVELOPMENTSINTRODUCTIONWisconsin Energy Corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non utility energy segment. Unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms Wisconsin Energy, the Company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries.Our utility energy segment primarily consists of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, both doing business under the trade name of "We Energies." We generate and distribute electricity in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and we distribute natural gas in Wisconsin. Our non utility energy segment primarily consists of We Power. We Power is principally engaged in the engineering, construction and development of electric power generating facilities for long term lease to Wisconsin Electric under our PTF strategy.CORPORATE STRATEGYBusiness OpportunitiesWe have three primary investment opportunities and earnings streams: our regulated utility business; our investment in ATC; and our generation plants within our non utility energy segment.Our regulated utility business primarily consists of electric generation assets and the electric and gas distribution assets that serve the electric and gas customers of We Energies. During 2011, our regulated utility earned $544.8 million of operating income. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $2.0 billion in this business to construct renewable generation and environmental projects at our electric generation assets, to update the electric and gas distribution infrastructure, and for other utility projects.We have a $349.7 million investment in ATC, which represents a 26.2% ownership interest. Our 2011 pre tax earnings from ATC totaled $62.5 million and we received $49.7 million in dividends from ATC. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $29.4 million in ATC as it continues to upgrade the transmission infrastructure within Wisconsin.Our non utility energy segment consists primarily of the four generation plants constructed as part of our PTF strategy. All four plants have been placed in service and are being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long term leases that run for 25 years (PWGS 1 and PWGS 2) and 30 years (OC 1 and OC 2). We recognize revenues on a levelized basis over the life of the lease. During 2012, we expect this segments operating income to be between $345 million and $350 million. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $75 million in this segment. The PTF strategy was developed with the primary goal of constructing the four power plants discussed above. With the completion of the final PTF unit, OC 2, in January 2011, we believe that our future capital expenditures in this segment will consist primarily of smaller capital projects within the existing PTF units. 40Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KRESULTS OF OPERATIONSCONSOLIDATED EARNINGSThe following table compares our operating income by business segment and our net income for 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility Energy $544.8 $564.0 $550.9Non Utility Energy 348.9 252.4 120.1Corporate and Other (6.4) (6.0) (10.7)Total Operating Income 887.3 810.4 660.3Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliate 62.5 60.1 59.1Other Income and Deductions, net 62.7 40.2 28.5Interest Expense, net 235.8 206.4 156.7Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 776.7 704.3 591.2Income Tax Expense 263.9 249.9 215.5Income from Continuing Operations 512.8 454.4 375.7Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 13.4 2.1 6.7Net Income $526.2 $456.5 $382.4 Diluted Earnings Per Share Continuing Operations $2.18 $1.92 $1.59Discontinued Operations 0.06 0.01 0.03Total Diluted Earnings Per Share $2.24 $1.93 $1.62An analysis of contributions to operating income by segment and a more detailed analysis of results follows.UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEThe following table summarizes our utility energy segments operating income during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Utility Energy Segment 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Operating Revenues Electric $3,211.3 $2,936.3 $2,685.0Gas 1,181.2 1,190.2 1,367.9Other 39.0 38.8 39.1Total Operating Revenues 4,431.5 4,165.3 4,092.0Fuel and Purchased Power 1,174.5 1,104.7 1,064.5Cost of Gas Sold 728.7 751.5 912.0Gross Margin 2,528.3 2,309.1 2,115.5Other Operating Expenses Other Operation and Maintenance 1,613.4 1,587.0 1,372.3Depreciation and Amortization 257.0 251.4 313.1Property and Revenue Taxes 113.1 105.1 109.9Total Operating Expenses 3,886.7 3,799.7 3,771.8Amortization of Gain 198.4 230.7Operating Income $544.8 $564.0 $550.9 41Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2011 vs. 2010: Our utility energy segment contributed $544.8 million of operating income during 2011 compared with $564.0 million of operating income during 2010. The decrease in operating income was primarily caused by increased other operation and maintenance expense and unfavorable weather during 2011 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by wholesale electric pricing increases and electric sales growth.2010 vs. 2009: Our utility energy segment contributed $564.0 million of operating income during 2010 compared with $550.9 million of operating income during 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by favorable weather during 2010, partially offset by unfavorable recoveries of revenues associated with fuel and purchased power in 2010.Electric Utility Gross MarginThe following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2011 with similar information for 2010 and 2009, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh SalesElectric Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $1,159.2 $1,114.3 $977.6 8,278.5 8,426.3 7,949.3Small Commercial/Industrial 1,006.9 922.2 860.3 8,795.8 8,823.3 8,571.6Large Commercial/Industrial 763.7 677.1 599.4 9,992.2 9,961.5 9,140.3Other Retail 22.9 21.9 21.2 153.6 155.3 156.5Total Retail 2,952.7 2,735.5 2,458.5 27,220.1 27,366.4 25,817.7Wholesale Other 154.0 134.6 116.7 2,024.8 2,004.6 1,529.4Resale Utilities 69.5 40.4 47.5 2,065.7 1,103.8 1,548.9Other Operating Revenues 35.1 25.8 62.3 Total 3,211.3 2,936.3 2,685.0 31,310.6 30,474.8 28,896.0 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 644.4 570.5 518.3 Purchased Power 514.8 521.0 533.8 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,159.2 1,091.5 1,052.1 Total Electric Gross Margin $2,052.1 $1,844.8 $1,632.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825Cooling (709 Normal) 793 944 475(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.Electric Utility Revenues and Sales2011 vs. 2010: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $275.0 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2010. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:2011 increase of approximately $198.4 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. For information on the bill credits, see Amortization of Gain below.Net pricing increases totaling $48.8 million, which includes rates related to our 2010 fuel recovery request that became effective March 25, 2010, and our request to review 2011 fuel costs that became effective April 29, 2011. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 42Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KUnfavorable weather as compared to the prior year that decreased electric revenues by an estimated $40.5 million.A $20.4 million increase in revenue from energy sold into the MISO Energy Markets, which was driven by increased MWh generation from our Oak Creek expansion units.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $16.2 million as compared to 2010.Higher MWh sales to our wholesale customers, which increased revenue by an estimated $10.4 million as compared to 2010.As measured by cooling degree days, 2011 was 11.8% warmer than normal, but 16.0% cooler than 2010. The 1.8% decrease in residential sales volumes in 2011 is primarily attributable to weather. The estimated 1.8% impact of cooler summer weather on our small commercial/industrial sales volumes was almost entirely offset by an estimated 1.5% increase in sales due to modest economic growth. Increased sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, accounted for the increase in sales to our large commercial/industrial customers. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by approximately 1.2% for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily because of previously announced plant closings.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $251.3 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2009. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:Net pricing increases totaling $121.0 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders that became effective in 2010. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.Favorable weather that increased electric revenues by an estimated $103.4 million as compared to 2009.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $43.0 million as compared to 2009.2010 pricing increases totaling approximately $32.3 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2010 was 98.7% warmer than 2009 and 35.2% warmer than normal. Collectively, retail sales to our residential and small commercial/industrial customers, who are more weather sensitive, increased by 4.4%. Sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 9.0% during 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily because of an improving economy. Electric sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, which represented approximately 6.9% of our annual sales in 2010, increased significantly for the year. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 3.2% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The $36.5 million decline in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2010 as compared to 2009.Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses2011 vs. 2010: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $67.7 million, or approximately 6.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily caused by a 2.7% increase in total MWh sales as well as increased coal and related transportation costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $39.4 million, or approximately 3.7%, when compared to 2009. This increase was primarily caused by a 5.5% increase in total MWh sales, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in the average cost/MWh between periods. The average cost/MWh was comparable between periods because of a 7.7% increase in generation from our lower cost coal units and a 16.5% decrease in the cost of natural gas used at the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS), which was sufficient to offset the impact of a 5.7% increase in coal and related transportation costs and the increase in gas generation and purchased power utilized as a result of the increased sales.Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm DeliveriesThe following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating revenues and cost of gas sold has declined over the last three years due to the decline in the commodity cost of natural gas during this three year period. 43Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,181.2 $1,190.2 $1,367.9Cost of Gas Sold 728.7 751.5 912.0Gross Margin $452.5 $438.7 $455.9We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2011, 2010 and 2009: Gross Margin Therm DeliveriesGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $290.2 $282.2 $291.5 776.8 741.2 803.4Commercial/Industrial 101.5 95.8 104.6 461.7 429.6 479.4Interruptible 1.8 2.2 2.0 16.0 19.4 19.1Total Retail 393.5 380.2 398.1 1,254.5 1,190.2 1,301.9Transported Gas 52.6 51.3 49.6 899.6 914.9 882.0Other Operating 6.4 7.2 8.2 Total $452.5 $438.7 $455.9 2,154.1 2,105.1 2,183.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.2011 vs. 2010: Our gas margin increased by $13.8 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2010 primarily because of an increase in sales volumes as a result of colder winter weather in 2011 as compared to 2010. As measured by heating degree days, 2011 was 7.3% colder than 2010 and 0.3% colder than normal.Winter weather is the most significant variable for our gas margin.2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal.Other Operation and Maintenance Expense2011 vs. 2010: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $26.4 million, or approximately 1.7%, when compared to 2010. Higher maintenance costs at one of our natural gas peaking plants, increased spending on forestry work for our electric distribution system and increased costs associated with the amortization of deferred PTF costs related to wholesale and Michigan customers were the primary drivers of the increase.Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2012 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease by $148 million because of the one year elimination of amortization expense on certain regulatory assets as authorized under our 2012 Wisconsin Rate Case. For additional information on the 2012 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 44Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense. Operating and maintenance costs and limited management fees associated with the plants are the responsibility of Wisconsin Electric and are recorded in the utility segment.

This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 46Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NETOther Income and Deductions, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $59.4 $32.5 $16.0Gain on Property Sales 2.4 4.4 1.7Other, net 0.9 3.3 10.8Total Other Income and Deductions, net $62.7 $40.2 $28.52011 vs. 2010: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $22.5 million, or 56.0%, when compared to 2010. The increase in AFUDC Equity is primarily related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.During 2012, we expect to see a reduction in AFUDC Equity with the completion of the Glacier Hills Wind park in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009. This increase primarily relates to increased AFUDC Equity related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project.CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, NETInterest Expense, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Gross Interest Costs $262.5 $258.7 $235.4Less: Capitalized Interest 26.7 52.3 78.7Interest Expense, net $235.8 $206.4 $156.72011 vs. 2010: Our gross interest costs increased by $3.8 million, or 1.5%, during 2011, primarily because of higher average long term debt balances as compared to 2010. In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault.Financing ActivitiesThe following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt$265.4 $71.1 $263.2Dividends on Common Stock(242.0) (187.0) (157.8)Common Stock Repurchased, Net(139.5) (65.7) (12.6)Other4.8 9.0 2.9Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing$(111.3) $(172.6) $95.72011 vs. 2010: Cash used in financing activities was $111.3 million during 2011, compared to $172.6 million during 2010. During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant.

The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

The decrease in operating income was primarily caused by increased other operation and maintenance expense and unfavorable weather during 2011 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by wholesale electric pricing increases and electric sales growth.2010 vs. 2009: Our utility energy segment contributed $564.0 million of operating income during 2010 compared with $550.9 million of operating income during 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by favorable weather during 2010, partially offset by unfavorable recoveries of revenues associated with fuel and purchased power in 2010.Electric Utility Gross MarginThe following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2011 with similar information for 2010 and 2009, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh SalesElectric Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $1,159.2 $1,114.3 $977.6 8,278.5 8,426.3 7,949.3Small Commercial/Industrial 1,006.9 922.2 860.3 8,795.8 8,823.3 8,571.6Large Commercial/Industrial 763.7 677.1 599.4 9,992.2 9,961.5 9,140.3Other Retail 22.9 21.9 21.2 153.6 155.3 156.5Total Retail 2,952.7 2,735.5 2,458.5 27,220.1 27,366.4 25,817.7Wholesale Other 154.0 134.6 116.7 2,024.8 2,004.6 1,529.4Resale Utilities 69.5 40.4 47.5 2,065.7 1,103.8 1,548.9Other Operating Revenues 35.1 25.8 62.3 Total 3,211.3 2,936.3 2,685.0 31,310.6 30,474.8 28,896.0 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 644.4 570.5 518.3 Purchased Power 514.8 521.0 533.8 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,159.2 1,091.5 1,052.1 Total Electric Gross Margin $2,052.1 $1,844.8 $1,632.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825Cooling (709 Normal) 793 944 475(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:2011 increase of approximately $198.4 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. For information on the bill credits, see Amortization of Gain below.Net pricing increases totaling $48.8 million, which includes rates related to our 2010 fuel recovery request that became effective March 25, 2010, and our request to review 2011 fuel costs that became effective April 29, 2011.

The 1.8% decrease in residential sales volumes in 2011 is primarily attributable to weather. The estimated 1.8% impact of cooler summer weather on our small commercial/industrial sales volumes was almost entirely offset by an estimated 1.5% increase in sales due to modest economic growth. Increased sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, accounted for the increase in sales to our large commercial/industrial customers. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by approximately 1.2% for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily because of previously announced plant closings.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $251.3 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2009. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:Net pricing increases totaling $121.0 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders that became effective in 2010. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.Favorable weather that increased electric revenues by an estimated $103.4 million as compared to 2009.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $43.0 million as compared to 2009.2010 pricing increases totaling approximately $32.3 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2010 was 98.7% warmer than 2009 and 35.2% warmer than normal. Collectively, retail sales to our residential and small commercial/industrial customers, who are more weather sensitive, increased by 4.4%. Sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 9.0% during 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily because of an improving economy. Electric sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, which represented approximately 6.9% of our annual sales in 2010, increased significantly for the year. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 3.2% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The $36.5 million decline in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2010 as compared to 2009.Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses2011 vs. 2010: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $67.7 million, or approximately 6.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily caused by a 2.7% increase in total MWh sales as well as increased coal and related transportation costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $39.4 million, or approximately 3.7%, when compared to 2009. This increase was primarily caused by a 5.5% increase in total MWh sales, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in the average cost/MWh between periods. The average cost/MWh was comparable between periods because of a 7.7% increase in generation from our lower cost coal units and a 16.5% decrease in the cost of natural gas used at the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS), which was sufficient to offset the impact of a 5.7% increase in coal and related transportation costs and the increase in gas generation and purchased power utilized as a result of the increased sales.Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm DeliveriesThe following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating revenues and cost of gas sold has declined over the last three years due to the decline in the commodity cost of natural gas during this three year period. 43Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,181.2 $1,190.2 $1,367.9Cost of Gas Sold 728.7 751.5 912.0Gross Margin $452.5 $438.7 $455.9We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2011, 2010 and 2009: Gross Margin Therm DeliveriesGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $290.2 $282.2 $291.5 776.8 741.2 803.4Commercial/Industrial 101.5 95.8 104.6 461.7 429.6 479.4Interruptible 1.8 2.2 2.0 16.0 19.4 19.1Total Retail 393.5 380.2 398.1 1,254.5 1,190.2 1,301.9Transported Gas 52.6 51.3 49.6 899.6 914.9 882.0Other Operating 6.4 7.2 8.2 Total $452.5 $438.7 $455.9 2,154.1 2,105.1 2,183.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.2011 vs. 2010: Our gas margin increased by $13.8 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2010 primarily because of an increase in sales volumes as a result of colder winter weather in 2011 as compared to 2010. As measured by heating degree days, 2011 was 7.3% colder than 2010 and 0.3% colder than normal.Winter weather is the most significant variable for our gas margin.2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal.Other Operation and Maintenance Expense2011 vs. 2010: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $26.4 million, or approximately 1.7%, when compared to 2010. Higher maintenance costs at one of our natural gas peaking plants, increased spending on forestry work for our electric distribution system and increased costs associated with the amortization of deferred PTF costs related to wholesale and Michigan customers were the primary drivers of the increase.Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2012 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease by $148 million because of the one year elimination of amortization expense on certain regulatory assets as authorized under our 2012 Wisconsin Rate Case. For additional information on the 2012 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 44Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense. Operating and maintenance costs and limited management fees associated with the plants are the responsibility of Wisconsin Electric and are recorded in the utility segment.

This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 46Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NETOther Income and Deductions, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $59.4 $32.5 $16.0Gain on Property Sales 2.4 4.4 1.7Other, net 0.9 3.3 10.8Total Other Income and Deductions, net $62.7 $40.2 $28.52011 vs. 2010: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $22.5 million, or 56.0%, when compared to 2010. The increase in AFUDC Equity is primarily related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.During 2012, we expect to see a reduction in AFUDC Equity with the completion of the Glacier Hills Wind park in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009.

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales.

During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations.

The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2011 vs. 2010: Our utility energy segment contributed $544.8 million of operating income during 2011 compared with $564.0 million of operating income during 2010. The decrease in operating income was primarily caused by increased other operation and maintenance expense and unfavorable weather during 2011 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by wholesale electric pricing increases and electric sales growth.2010 vs. 2009: Our utility energy segment contributed $564.0 million of operating income during 2010 compared with $550.9 million of operating income during 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by favorable weather during 2010, partially offset by unfavorable recoveries of revenues associated with fuel and purchased power in 2010.Electric Utility Gross MarginThe following table compares our electric utility gross margin during 2011 with similar information for 2010 and 2009, including a summary of electric operating revenues and electric sales by customer class: Electric Revenues and Gross Margin MWh SalesElectric Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Thousands, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $1,159.2 $1,114.3 $977.6 8,278.5 8,426.3 7,949.3Small Commercial/Industrial 1,006.9 922.2 860.3 8,795.8 8,823.3 8,571.6Large Commercial/Industrial 763.7 677.1 599.4 9,992.2 9,961.5 9,140.3Other Retail 22.9 21.9 21.2 153.6 155.3 156.5Total Retail 2,952.7 2,735.5 2,458.5 27,220.1 27,366.4 25,817.7Wholesale Other 154.0 134.6 116.7 2,024.8 2,004.6 1,529.4Resale Utilities 69.5 40.4 47.5 2,065.7 1,103.8 1,548.9Other Operating Revenues 35.1 25.8 62.3 Total 3,211.3 2,936.3 2,685.0 31,310.6 30,474.8 28,896.0 Fuel and Purchased Power Fuel 644.4 570.5 518.3 Purchased Power 514.8 521.0 533.8 Total Fuel and Purchased Power 1,159.2 1,091.5 1,052.1 Total Electric Gross Margin $2,052.1 $1,844.8 $1,632.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825Cooling (709 Normal) 793 944 475(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.Electric Utility Revenues and Sales2011 vs. 2010: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $275.0 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2010. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:2011 increase of approximately $198.4 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. For information on the bill credits, see Amortization of Gain below.Net pricing increases totaling $48.8 million, which includes rates related to our 2010 fuel recovery request that became effective March 25, 2010, and our request to review 2011 fuel costs that became effective April 29, 2011. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 42Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KUnfavorable weather as compared to the prior year that decreased electric revenues by an estimated $40.5 million.A $20.4 million increase in revenue from energy sold into the MISO Energy Markets, which was driven by increased MWh generation from our Oak Creek expansion units.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $16.2 million as compared to 2010.Higher MWh sales to our wholesale customers, which increased revenue by an estimated $10.4 million as compared to 2010.As measured by cooling degree days, 2011 was 11.8% warmer than normal, but 16.0% cooler than 2010. The 1.8% decrease in residential sales volumes in 2011 is primarily attributable to weather. The estimated 1.8% impact of cooler summer weather on our small commercial/industrial sales volumes was almost entirely offset by an estimated 1.5% increase in sales due to modest economic growth. Increased sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, accounted for the increase in sales to our large commercial/industrial customers. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by approximately 1.2% for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily because of previously announced plant closings.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $251.3 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2009. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:Net pricing increases totaling $121.0 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders that became effective in 2010. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.Favorable weather that increased electric revenues by an estimated $103.4 million as compared to 2009.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $43.0 million as compared to 2009.2010 pricing increases totaling approximately $32.3 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2010 was 98.7% warmer than 2009 and 35.2% warmer than normal. Collectively, retail sales to our residential and small commercial/industrial customers, who are more weather sensitive, increased by 4.4%. Sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 9.0% during 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily because of an improving economy. Electric sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, which represented approximately 6.9% of our annual sales in 2010, increased significantly for the year. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 3.2% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The $36.5 million decline in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2010 as compared to 2009.Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses2011 vs. 2010: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $67.7 million, or approximately 6.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily caused by a 2.7% increase in total MWh sales as well as increased coal and related transportation costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $39.4 million, or approximately 3.7%, when compared to 2009. This increase was primarily caused by a 5.5% increase in total MWh sales, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in the average cost/MWh between periods. The average cost/MWh was comparable between periods because of a 7.7% increase in generation from our lower cost coal units and a 16.5% decrease in the cost of natural gas used at the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS), which was sufficient to offset the impact of a 5.7% increase in coal and related transportation costs and the increase in gas generation and purchased power utilized as a result of the increased sales.Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm DeliveriesThe following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating revenues and cost of gas sold has declined over the last three years due to the decline in the commodity cost of natural gas during this three year period. 43Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,181.2 $1,190.2 $1,367.9Cost of Gas Sold 728.7 751.5 912.0Gross Margin $452.5 $438.7 $455.9We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2011, 2010 and 2009: Gross Margin Therm DeliveriesGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $290.2 $282.2 $291.5 776.8 741.2 803.4Commercial/Industrial 101.5 95.8 104.6 461.7 429.6 479.4Interruptible 1.8 2.2 2.0 16.0 19.4 19.1Total Retail 393.5 380.2 398.1 1,254.5 1,190.2 1,301.9Transported Gas 52.6 51.3 49.6 899.6 914.9 882.0Other Operating 6.4 7.2 8.2 Total $452.5 $438.7 $455.9 2,154.1 2,105.1 2,183.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.2011 vs. 2010: Our gas margin increased by $13.8 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2010 primarily because of an increase in sales volumes as a result of colder winter weather in 2011 as compared to 2010. As measured by heating degree days, 2011 was 7.3% colder than 2010 and 0.3% colder than normal.Winter weather is the most significant variable for our gas margin.2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal.Other Operation and Maintenance Expense2011 vs. 2010: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $26.4 million, or approximately 1.7%, when compared to 2010. Higher maintenance costs at one of our natural gas peaking plants, increased spending on forestry work for our electric distribution system and increased costs associated with the amortization of deferred PTF costs related to wholesale and Michigan customers were the primary drivers of the increase.Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2012 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease by $148 million because of the one year elimination of amortization expense on certain regulatory assets as authorized under our 2012 Wisconsin Rate Case. For additional information on the 2012 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 44Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense.

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault.Financing ActivitiesThe following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt$265.4 $71.1 $263.2Dividends on Common Stock(242.0) (187.0) (157.8)Common Stock Repurchased, Net(139.5) (65.7) (12.6)Other4.8 9.0 2.9Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing$(111.3) $(172.6) $95.72011 vs. 2010: Cash used in financing activities was $111.3 million during 2011, compared to $172.6 million during 2010. During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KUnfavorable weather as compared to the prior year that decreased electric revenues by an estimated $40.5 million.A $20.4 million increase in revenue from energy sold into the MISO Energy Markets, which was driven by increased MWh generation from our Oak Creek expansion units.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $16.2 million as compared to 2010.Higher MWh sales to our wholesale customers, which increased revenue by an estimated $10.4 million as compared to 2010.As measured by cooling degree days, 2011 was 11.8% warmer than normal, but 16.0% cooler than 2010. The 1.8% decrease in residential sales volumes in 2011 is primarily attributable to weather. The estimated 1.8% impact of cooler summer weather on our small commercial/industrial sales volumes was almost entirely offset by an estimated 1.5% increase in sales due to modest economic growth. Increased sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, accounted for the increase in sales to our large commercial/industrial customers. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by approximately 1.2% for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily because of previously announced plant closings.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric utility operating revenues increased by $251.3 million, or 9.4%, when compared to 2009. The most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:Net pricing increases totaling $121.0 million related to Wisconsin and Michigan rate orders that became effective in 2010. For information on these rate orders, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters.Favorable weather that increased electric revenues by an estimated $103.4 million as compared to 2009.Net economic growth that increased electric revenues by an estimated $43.0 million as compared to 2009.2010 pricing increases totaling approximately $32.3 million, reflecting the reduction of Point Beach bill credits to retail customers. As measured by cooling degree days, 2010 was 98.7% warmer than 2009 and 35.2% warmer than normal. Collectively, retail sales to our residential and small commercial/industrial customers, who are more weather sensitive, increased by 4.4%. Sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 9.0% during 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily because of an improving economy. Electric sales to our largest customers, two iron ore mines, which represented approximately 6.9% of our annual sales in 2010, increased significantly for the year. If these sales are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers increased by 3.2% for 2010 as compared to 2009. The $36.5 million decline in Other Operating Revenues primarily relates to regulatory amortizations during 2010 as compared to 2009.Electric Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses2011 vs. 2010: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $67.7 million, or approximately 6.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily caused by a 2.7% increase in total MWh sales as well as increased coal and related transportation costs, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.2010 vs. 2009: Our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $39.4 million, or approximately 3.7%, when compared to 2009. This increase was primarily caused by a 5.5% increase in total MWh sales, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in the average cost/MWh between periods. The average cost/MWh was comparable between periods because of a 7.7% increase in generation from our lower cost coal units and a 16.5% decrease in the cost of natural gas used at the Port Washington Generating Station (PWGS), which was sufficient to offset the impact of a 5.7% increase in coal and related transportation costs and the increase in gas generation and purchased power utilized as a result of the increased sales.Gas Utility Revenues, Gross Margin and Therm DeliveriesThe following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating revenues and cost of gas sold has declined over the last three years due to the decline in the commodity cost of natural gas during this three year period. 43Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Operating Revenues $1,181.2 $1,190.2 $1,367.9Cost of Gas Sold 728.7 751.5 912.0Gross Margin $452.5 $438.7 $455.9We believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under GCRMs. The following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2011, 2010 and 2009: Gross Margin Therm DeliveriesGas Utility Operations 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) (Millions, Except Degree Days)Customer Class Residential $290.2 $282.2 $291.5 776.8 741.2 803.4Commercial/Industrial 101.5 95.8 104.6 461.7 429.6 479.4Interruptible 1.8 2.2 2.0 16.0 19.4 19.1Total Retail 393.5 380.2 398.1 1,254.5 1,190.2 1,301.9Transported Gas 52.6 51.3 49.6 899.6 914.9 882.0Other Operating 6.4 7.2 8.2 Total $452.5 $438.7 $455.9 2,154.1 2,105.1 2,183.9 Weather Degree Days (a) Heating (6,615 Normal) 6,633 6,183 6,825(a)As measured at Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.2011 vs. 2010: Our gas margin increased by $13.8 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2010 primarily because of an increase in sales volumes as a result of colder winter weather in 2011 as compared to 2010. As measured by heating degree days, 2011 was 7.3% colder than 2010 and 0.3% colder than normal.Winter weather is the most significant variable for our gas margin.2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal.Other Operation and Maintenance Expense2011 vs. 2010: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $26.4 million, or approximately 1.7%, when compared to 2010. Higher maintenance costs at one of our natural gas peaking plants, increased spending on forestry work for our electric distribution system and increased costs associated with the amortization of deferred PTF costs related to wholesale and Michigan customers were the primary drivers of the increase.Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2012 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease by $148 million because of the one year elimination of amortization expense on certain regulatory assets as authorized under our 2012 Wisconsin Rate Case. For additional information on the 2012 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 44Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense. Operating and maintenance costs and limited management fees associated with the plants are the responsibility of Wisconsin Electric and are recorded in the utility segment.

This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 46Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NETOther Income and Deductions, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $59.4 $32.5 $16.0Gain on Property Sales 2.4 4.4 1.7Other, net 0.9 3.3 10.8Total Other Income and Deductions, net $62.7 $40.2 $28.52011 vs. 2010: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $22.5 million, or 56.0%, when compared to 2010. The increase in AFUDC Equity is primarily related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.During 2012, we expect to see a reduction in AFUDC Equity with the completion of the Glacier Hills Wind park in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009.

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales.

During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations.

The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems.

Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

Normal degree days are based upon a 20 year moving average.2011 vs. 2010: Our gas margin increased by $13.8 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2010 primarily because of an increase in sales volumes as a result of colder winter weather in 2011 as compared to 2010. As measured by heating degree days, 2011 was 7.3% colder than 2010 and 0.3% colder than normal.Winter weather is the most significant variable for our gas margin.2010 vs. 2009: Our gas margin decreased by $17.2 million, or approximately 3.8%, when compared to 2009 primarily because of a decline in sales volumes as a result of warmer winter weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As measured by heating degree days, 2010 was 9.4% warmer than 2009 and 6.5% warmer than normal.Other Operation and Maintenance Expense2011 vs. 2010: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $26.4 million, or approximately 1.7%, when compared to 2010. Higher maintenance costs at one of our natural gas peaking plants, increased spending on forestry work for our electric distribution system and increased costs associated with the amortization of deferred PTF costs related to wholesale and Michigan customers were the primary drivers of the increase.Our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets. We expect our 2012 other operation and maintenance expense to decrease by $148 million because of the one year elimination of amortization expense on certain regulatory assets as authorized under our 2012 Wisconsin Rate Case. For additional information on the 2012 rate case, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 44Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense.

This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 46Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NETOther Income and Deductions, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $59.4 $32.5 $16.0Gain on Property Sales 2.4 4.4 1.7Other, net 0.9 3.3 10.8Total Other Income and Deductions, net $62.7 $40.2 $28.52011 vs. 2010: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $22.5 million, or 56.0%, when compared to 2010. The increase in AFUDC Equity is primarily related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.During 2012, we expect to see a reduction in AFUDC Equity with the completion of the Glacier Hills Wind park in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009.

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales.

During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 vs. 2009: Our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $214.7 million, or approximately 15.6%, when compared to 2009. The 2010 PSCW rate case order allowed for pricing increases related to regulatory items including PTF lease costs, bad debt expense and amortization of other deferred costs. We estimate that these items were approximately $87.3 million higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. In addition, operation and maintenance expenses at our power plants increased approximately $63.9 million primarily because of the operation of OC 1, which was placed in service in February 2010, and higher maintenance costs at our other power plants. We also had increased operation and maintenance expenses of approximately $20.8 million related to increased reliability maintenance in our distribution system in 2010 and responding to damage caused by a larger number of summer storms compared to 2009. In addition, our benefits expense increased by approximately $28.8 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of increased pension costs.Depreciation and Amortization Expense2011 vs. 2010: Depreciation and Amortization expense increased by $5.6 million, or approximately 2.2%, when compared to 2010. This increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service.We expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in 2012 as a result of an increase in utility plant in service related to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went in service in December 2011, and the Oak Creek AQCS project, which is scheduled to go in service in 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased by $61.7 million, or approximately 19.7%, when compared to 2009. This decrease was primarily because of new depreciation rates that were implemented in connection with the 2010 PSCW rate case order. The new depreciation rates generally reflect longer lives for our utility assets.Amortization of GainIn connection with the September 2007 sale of Point Beach, we reached an agreement with our regulators to allow for the net gain on the sale to be used for the benefit of our customers. The majority of the benefits were returned to customers in the form of bill credits. The net gain was originally recorded as a regulatory liability, and it was amortized to the income statement as we issued bill credits to customers. When the bill credits were issued to customers, we transferred cash from the restricted accounts to the unrestricted accounts, adjusted for taxes. All bill credits associated with the sale of Point Beach were applied to customers as of December 31, 2010, and as a result, the Amortization of Gain was zero during 2011 as compared to $198.4 million during 2010 and $230.7 million during 2009.NON UTILITY ENERGY SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING INCOMEOur non utility energy segment consists primarily of our PTF units (PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2). PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. The common facilities associated with the Oak Creek expansion include the water intake system, which was placed in service in January 2009, the coal handling system, which was placed in service in November 2007, and other smaller assets. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.The table below reflects:A full years earnings for 2011, 2010 and 2009 for: PWGS 1;PWGS 2;the coal handling system for the Oak Creek expansion; andthe water intake system for the Oak Creek expansionA full years earnings for 2011 and approximately eleven months of earnings for 2010 for OC 1; andApproximately eleven and a half months of earnings for 2011 for OC 2. 45Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThis segment reflects the lease revenues on the new units as well as the depreciation expense.

This change is primarily due to a reduction in other operation and maintenance expense. 46Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED OTHER INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS, NETOther Income and Deductions, net 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) AFUDC Equity $59.4 $32.5 $16.0Gain on Property Sales 2.4 4.4 1.7Other, net 0.9 3.3 10.8Total Other Income and Deductions, net $62.7 $40.2 $28.52011 vs. 2010: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $22.5 million, or 56.0%, when compared to 2010. The increase in AFUDC Equity is primarily related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.During 2012, we expect to see a reduction in AFUDC Equity with the completion of the Glacier Hills Wind park in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Other income and deductions, net increased by approximately $11.7 million, or 41.1%, when compared to 2009.

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales.

The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales.

For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

In January 2011, we issued $420 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 2 and for other corporate purposes. In September 2011, we issued $300 million of long term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes. In April 2011, we retired $450 million of long term debt that matured, which partially offset the debt issuances. Our capitalized interest decreased by $25.6 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 2 when it was placed in service in January 2011. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $29.4 million, or 14.2%, as compared to 2010.During 2012, we expect to see higher net interest expense because of a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of the Glacier Hills Wind Park project going in service in December 2011 and the expected completion of the Oak Creek AQCS project by the end of 2012.2010 vs. 2009: Our gross interest costs increased by $23.3 million, or 9.9%, during 2010, primarily because of higher long term debt balances compared to 2009. In February 2010, we issued $530 million of long term debt in connection with the commercial operation of OC 1 and used the net proceeds to repay short term debt incurred during construction. Our capitalized interest decreased by $26.4 million primarily because we stopped capitalizing interest on OC 1 when it was placed in service in February 2010. As a result, our net interest expense increased by $49.7 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2009. 47Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault.Financing ActivitiesThe following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt$265.4 $71.1 $263.2Dividends on Common Stock(242.0) (187.0) (157.8)Common Stock Repurchased, Net(139.5) (65.7) (12.6)Other4.8 9.0 2.9Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing$(111.3) $(172.6) $95.72011 vs. 2010: Cash used in financing activities was $111.3 million during 2011, compared to $172.6 million during 2010. During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE2011 vs. 2010: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 34.0% in 2011 compared to 35.5% in 2010. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity. For further information, see Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our 2012 annual effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37%.2010 vs. 2009: Our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 35.5% in 2010 compared to 36.5% in 2009. This reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased AFUDC Equity and increased production activities tax deductions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOWSThe following table summarizes our cash flows during 2011, 2010 and 2009:Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars)Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $993.4 $810.4 $628.9Investing Activities $(892.5) $(633.5) $(736.1)Financing Activities $(111.3) $(172.6) $95.7Operating Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash provided by operating activities was $993.4 million during 2011, which was an increase of $183.0 million over 2010. The largest increases in cash provided by operating activities related to higher net income, higher depreciation expense, higher deferred income tax benefits and the elimination of the amortization of the gain on the sale of Point Beach. Combined these items totaled $1,293.2 million during 2011 as compared to $680.4 million during 2010. The largest reduction in cash provided by operating activities related to our contributions to qualified benefit plans. During 2011, we contributed $277.4 million to our qualified benefit plans. We made no contributions to our qualified plans during 2010.2010 vs. 2009: Cash provided by operating activities was $810.4 million during 2010, which was an increase of $181.5 million over 2009. This increase is primarily related to a $289.3 million contribution to our qualified benefit plans in 2009. No such contributions were made in 2010. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for taxes during 2010.Investing Activities2011 vs. 2010: Cash used in investing activities was $892.5 million during 2011, which was $259.0 million higher than 2010. This increase in cash used primarily reflects changes in restricted cash and increased capital expenditures. During 2011, our restricted cash increased by $37.2 million primarily because of the nuclear fuel settlement we received from the DOE. During 2010, our restricted cash decreased by $186.2 million due to the release of restricted cash related to the Point Beach bill credits. See Nuclear Operations in this report for additional information regarding the settlement with the DOE. In addition, capital expenditures increased by approximately $32.6 million during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased spending related to the construction of the Oak Creek AQCS project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park in 2011 as compared to 2010. 48Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table identifies capital expenditures by year:Capital Expenditures 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Utility $792.2 $687.0 $547.0We Power 31.2 109.3 253.2Other 7.4 1.9 14.4Total Capital Expenditures $830.8 $798.2 $814.62010 vs. 2009: Cash used in investing activities was $633.5 million during 2010, which was $102.6 million lower than the same period in 2009 because of lower capital expenditures, lower investments in ATC and higher proceeds from asset sales. During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault.Financing ActivitiesThe following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt$265.4 $71.1 $263.2Dividends on Common Stock(242.0) (187.0) (157.8)Common Stock Repurchased, Net(139.5) (65.7) (12.6)Other4.8 9.0 2.9Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing$(111.3) $(172.6) $95.72011 vs. 2010: Cash used in financing activities was $111.3 million during 2011, compared to $172.6 million during 2010. During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

During 2010, we received $63 million of proceeds from the sale of Edison Sault.Financing ActivitiesThe following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Net Increase in Debt$265.4 $71.1 $263.2Dividends on Common Stock(242.0) (187.0) (157.8)Common Stock Repurchased, Net(139.5) (65.7) (12.6)Other4.8 9.0 2.9Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing$(111.3) $(172.6) $95.72011 vs. 2010: Cash used in financing activities was $111.3 million during 2011, compared to $172.6 million during 2010. During 2011, we issued a total of $720.0 million of long term debt and retired $466.6 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt and for other corporate purposes. For additional information on the debt issuances, see Note J Long Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our common stock dividends increased in 2011 as we raised our dividend rate by 30.0%. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of approximately 15.4% in the quarterly common stock dividend.In addition, on May 5, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock through the end of 2013. Funds for the repurchases are expected to come from internally generated funds and working capital supplemented, if required in the short term, by the sale of commercial paper. The repurchase program does not obligate Wisconsin Energy to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares in the open market pursuant to this program at an average cost of $30.79 per share and a total cost of $100.0 million.2010 vs. 2009: Cash used in financing activities during 2010 was $172.6 million, compared to $95.7 million of cash provided in 2009. During 2010, we issued a total of $530.0 million of long term debt and retired $291.7 million of long term debt. The net proceeds from the new issuance of debt were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the construction of OC 1 and for other corporate purposes. Our common stock dividends increased in 2010 as we raised our dividend rate by 18.5%.No new shares of Wisconsin Energys common stock were issued in 2011, 2010 or 2009. During these years, our plan agents purchased, in the open market, 3.0 million shares at a cost of $93.9 million, 5.8 million shares at a cost of $156.6 million and 1.4 million shares at a cost of $29.6 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received proceeds of $54.4 million, $90.9 million and 49Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems.

Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K$17.0 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. In addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTSLiquidityWe anticipate meeting our capital requirements during 2012 and beyond primarily through internally generated funds and short term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long term debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors. We currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. Our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. We currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas maintain bank back up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each companys obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back up credit facilities that were entered into in December 2010. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. During 2011, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $717.3 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.25%. For additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2011, see Note K Short Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We review our bank back up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. The following table summarizes such facilities as of December 31, 2011:Company Total Facility Letters of Credit Credit Available Facility Expiration (Millions of Dollars) Wisconsin Energy $450.0 $0.4 $449.6 December 2013Wisconsin Electric $500.0 $5.9 $494.1 December 2013Wisconsin Gas $300.0 $ $300.0 December 2013Each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one year extensions, subject to lender approval.The following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view the Junior Notes: 50Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K 2011 2010Capitalization Structure Actual Adjusted Actual Adjusted (Millions of Dollars) Common Equity $3,963.3 $4,213.3 $3,802.1 $4,052.1Preferred Stock of Subsidiary 30.4 30.4 30.4 30.4Long Term Debt (including current maturities) 4,646.9 4,396.9 4,405.4 4,155.4Short Term Debt 669.9 669.9 657.9 657.9Total Capitalization $9,310.5 $9,310.5 $8,895.8 $8,895.8 Total Debt $5,316.8 $5,066.8 $5,063.3 $4,813.3 Ratio of Debt to Total Capitalization 57.1% 54.4% 56.9% 54.1%For a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long term debt on a consolidated basis, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.Included in Long Term Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

The adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the Junior Notes to Common Equity and $250 million to Long Term Debt. We believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the Junior Notes.The adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages Wisconsin Energys capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the Junior Notes. Therefore, we believe the non GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.As described in Note I Common Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. We do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.Wisconsin Electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. In August 2009, Wisconsin Electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. Wisconsin Electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. As of December 31, 2011, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were reported as a reduction in our consolidated long term debt because they are held by Wisconsin Electric. Depending on market conditions and other factors, Wisconsin Electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.Bonus Depreciation ProvisionsIn December 2010, the President of the United States signed tax legislation extending the bonus depreciation rules to certain projects placed in service in 2010, 2011 and 2012. As a result of this extension, we recognized increased federal tax depreciation in 2010 and 2011 relating to assets placed in service during those years, including the Glacier Hills Wind Park, OC 1 and OC 2. In addition, we also anticipate an increase in tax depreciation in 2012 for assets placed in service during 2012, including the Oak Creek AQCS project. As a result of the increased tax depreciation in 2011 and 2012, we will not make federal income tax payments for 2011 and do not anticipate making federal income tax payments for 2012. 51Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems.

Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KCredit Rating RiskWe do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. We do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB at S&P and or Baa3 at Moodys. As of December 31, 2011, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $184.5 million. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Wisconsin Energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. We also have commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.In addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.In November 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2). In December 2011, Moodys affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, P 2; senior unsecured, A3; junior unsecured, Baa1), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, P 1; senior unsecured, A2), ERGSS (senior notes, A2) and WECC (senior unsecured, A3). Moodys affirmed the stable ratings outlook assigned to each company.In June 2011, S&P raised the rating of Wisconsin Energys junior unsecured debt to BBB from BBB , and affirmed the ratings of the remaining debt of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, BBB+), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, A 2; senior unsecured, A ) and ERGSS (senior notes, A ). S&P also revised the ratings outlooks assigned to each company from positive to stable in June 2011, after revising the ratings outlooks of each company from stable to positive in March 2011.In June 2011, Fitch affirmed the ratings of Wisconsin Energy (commercial paper, F2; senior unsecured, A ; junior unsecured, BBB), Wisconsin Electric (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), Wisconsin Gas (commercial paper, F1; senior unsecured, A+), ERGSS (senior notes, A+) and WECC (senior unsecured, A ). Fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlooks assigned to each company.Subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures: Our estimated 2012, 2013 and 2014 capital expenditures are as follows:Capital Expenditures 2012 2013 2014 (Millions of Dollars)Utility Renewable $160.6 $24.4 $Environmental 71.0 43.3 38.8Base Spending 473.2 611.0 586.4Total Utility 704.8 678.7 625.2 We Power 20.1 41.4 16.5 Other 15.3 9.3 1.7Total $740.2 $729.4 $643.4Base spending primarily consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. Our actual future long term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such 52Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kas air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.Common Stock Matters: During 2012, we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock under the share repurchase program approved by the Board on May 5, 2011, and to pay the increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share approved by the Board in January 2012. Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

Investments in Outside Trusts: We use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post retirement obligations. These trusts had investments of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2011. These trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.During 2011, we contributed $236.4 million to our qualified pension plans and $41.0 million to our qualified Other Post Retirement Employee Benefit (OPEB) plans. We did not make contributions to the plans during 2010 as they were adequately funded. Future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long term discount rates. For additional information, see Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. For additional information, see Note G Variable Interest Entities and Note O Guarantees in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Contractual Obligations/Commercial Commitments: We have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (a) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (Millions of Dollars) Long Term Debt Obligations (b) $8,245.2 $273.1 $1,181.6 $891.1 $5,899.4Capital Lease Obligations (c) 295.1 38.9 82.3 88.6 85.3Operating Lease Obligations (d) 63.3 16.3 10.4 7.6 29.0Purchase Obligations (e) 13,473.1 974.1 1,446.1 1,072.4 9,980.5Other Long Term Liabilities (f) 111.4 110.3 0.8 0.3 Total Contractual Obligations $22,188.1 $1,412.7 $2,721.2 $2,060.0 $15,994.2(a)The amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.(b)Principal and interest payments on Long Term Debt (excluding capital lease obligations).

For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes because we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the amount and period of related future payments at this time. For additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to Note H Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.Obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESMARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKSWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:Regulatory Recovery: Our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. Our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. Our primary regulator is the PSCW. Regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. We expect to recover our outstanding regulatory assets in rates over a period of no longer than 20 years. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, our regulatory assets totaled $1,265.7 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $915.9 million.Commodity Prices: In the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.Wisconsins retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of Wisconsin Electrics risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. Effective January 1, 2011, the PSCW implemented new fuel rules which allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). Under the rules, any over or under collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. For information regarding the fuel rules, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters Wisconsin Fuel Rules.Natural Gas Costs: Higher natural gas costs increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of Wisconsin. Higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. Higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and or fuel substitution.As part of its November 2011 rate order, the PSCW authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs through December 31, 2012. The escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of Wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates. As a result of GCRMs, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. However, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. For information concerning the natural gas utilities GCRMs, see Utility Rates and Regulatory Matters. 54Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWeather: Our Wisconsin utility rates are set by the PSCW based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20 year averages. Wisconsin Electrics electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. A summary of actual weather information in the utility segments service territory during 2011, 2010 and 2009, as measured by degree days, may be found above in Results of Operations.Interest Rate: We have various short term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. We also have variable rate long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. Future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels.We performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long term debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $669.9 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.27% and $147.0 million of variable rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.50%. A one percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $8.2 million.Marketable Securities Return: We use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. We believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.The fair value of our trust fund assets as of December 31, 2011 was approximately:Wisconsin Energy Corporation Millions of Dollars Pension trust funds $1,262.5Other post retirement benefits trust funds $255.4For 2012, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 7.25% and 7.5%, respectively, for the pension and OPEB plans.Fiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.We consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted average of long term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.Economic Conditions: Our service territory is within the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy.Inflation: We continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance and new generation in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. We do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.For additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. 55Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KPOWER THE FUTUREAll of the PTF units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

The PTF units include PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. The following table identifies certain key items related to the units:Unit Name In Service Cash Costs (a) PWGS 1 July 2005 $333 millionPWGS 2 May 2008 $331 millionOC 1 February 2010 $1,354 millionOC 2 January 2011 $662 million(a)Cash costs represent actual and current projected costs, excluding capitalized interest. Approximate costs for OC 1 and OC 2 include the cost of the settlement agreement with Bechtel adjusted for our ownership percentage.We are recovering our costs in these units through lease payments associated with PWGS 1, PWGS 2 and OC 1 that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electrics rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC and FERC. Wisconsin Electric is recovering the lease payments associated with OC 2 as authorized by the PSCW and FERC, and has requested authorization from the MPSC in the rate case filed in July 2011. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the PWGS Units and 55% for the Oak Creek Units. The interest component of the return has been determined at rates in effect at the time of commercial operation.Background: The PSCW issued orders granting CPCNs for the construction of the PWGS and the Oak Creek expansion in 2002 and 2003, respectively.PWGS consists of two natural gas fired combined cycle generating units on the site of Wisconsin Electrics former Port Washington Power Plant, the natural gas lateral to supply the new plant, and the transmission system upgrades required of ATC. PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 were completed within the PSCW approved cost parameters and were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively.The Oak Creek expansion consists of two coal fired generating units located adjacent to the site of Wisconsin Electrics existing Oak Creek Power Plant. OC 1 and OC 2 were placed into service on February 2, 2010 and January 12, 2011, respectively. The PSCW set the total cost for the two units at $2.191 billion. We estimate that the final cost of the Oak Creek expansion is approximately $181 million, or 8.3%, over the amount initially approved by the PSCW, of which our share is approximately $154 million. The additional amount includes the amounts payable to Bechtel pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The order approving the Oak Creek expansion provides for recovery of excess costs of up to 5% of the total project, subject to a prudence review by the PSCW. Costs above the 5% cap would also be included in lease payments and recovered from customers if the PSCW finds that such costs were prudently incurred and were the result of force majeure conditions, an excused event and or event of loss. In addition, the leases provided for a guaranteed in service date of September 29, 2009 for OC 1 and September 29, 2010 for OC 2, and imposed liquidated damages of $250,000 per day, of which ERGSS share is approximately $208,350 per day, for failure to achieve the guaranteed in service date unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or an excused event. In light of the weather delays incurred on the project and other factors, we expect to request authorization from the PSCW to recover all costs associated with the units and to grant relief from liquidated damages.ERGSS was entitled to receive its share of $250,000 per day from Bechtel under the contract with Bechtel for each day Bechtel failed to achieve the guaranteed in service dates of September 29, 2009 and September 29, 2010, unless the delays resulted from force majeure conditions or excused events. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and a change order signed concurrent with the turnover of OC 2, Bechtel was granted total schedule relief of 120 days for OC 1 and 81 days for OC 2. Therefore, Bechtel was responsible for 5 days of liquidated damages for OC 1 and 23 days for OC 2. All liquidated damages collected are for the benefit of Wisconsin Electrics customers. Although we anticipate the PSCW will agree that the excused delays were caused by force majeure and other conditions, there is no guarantee that it will grant ERGSS the same schedule relief. 56Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KFor information regarding the Settlement Agreement, see Oak Creek Construction Contract in Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Lease Terms: The PSCW approved the lease agreements and related documents under which Wisconsin Electric will staff, operate and maintain PWGS 1, PWGS 2, OC 1 and OC 2. Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K

Key terms of the leased generation contracts are as follows:PWGS 1 & PWGS 2Initial lease term of 25 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 25 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 53% equity, 47% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Fixed construction cost of PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 at $309.6 million and $280.3 million (2001 dollars) subject to escalation at the GDP inflation rate;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.OC 1 & OC 2Initial lease term of 30 years with the potential for subsequent renewals at reduced rates;Cost recovery over a 30 year period on a mortgage basis amortization schedule;Imputed capital structure of 55% equity, 45% debt;Authorized rate of return of 12.7% after tax on equity;Recovery of carrying costs during construction; andOngoing PSCW supervisory authority over those lease terms and conditions specifically identified in the order, which do not include the key financial terms.UTILITY RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERSThe PSCW regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of Wisconsin, while FERC regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. The MPSC regulates our retail electric rates in the state of Michigan. Within our regulated segment, we estimate that approximately 86% of our electric revenues are regulated by the PSCW, 7% are regulated by the MPSC and the balance of our electric revenues is regulated by FERC. In Wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. All of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the PSCW. Orders from the PSCW can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the MPSC can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.2012 Wisconsin Rate Case: On May 26, 2011, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas filed an application with the PSCW to initiate rate proceedings. In lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which results in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. In 2012, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas would seek base rate increases to be effective in 2013. In order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas requested that the PSCW issue an order that:Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.Authorizes $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously authorized air quality and renewable energy projects, effective January 1, 2012.Authorizes the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE.Authorizes Wisconsin Electric to reopen the rate proceeding in 2012 to address, for rates effective in 2013, all issues set aside during 2012, including the determination of the final approved construction costs for the Oak Creek expansion.Schedules a proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan.On October 6, 2011, the PSCW approved our proposal as filed. We received a final written order from the PSCW on 57Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant.

The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KNovember 3, 2011. For information related to the proceeding to establish a 2012 fuel cost plan, see 2012 Fuel Recovery Request below. We expect to initiate a traditional rate case filing in early 2012 for new electric, gas and steam rates to be effective in January 2013.2012 Michigan Rate Case: On July 5, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and OC 2. Michigan law allows utilities, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to self implement a rate increase request, subject to refund with interest. Therefore, in January 2012, we implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase. This increase is offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from Wisconsin Electrics settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the DOE, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. In addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate effective January 1, 2012. Therefore, the total self implementation was $7.7 million. A final decision from the MPSC is expected in July 2012. 2010 Wisconsin Rate Case: In March 2009, Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas initiated rate proceedings with the PSCW. Wisconsin Electric initially asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its Wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $76.5 million, or 2.8%, and a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $22.1 million, or 3.6%. In addition, Wisconsin Electric requested increases of approximately $1.4 million, or 5.8%, and approximately $1.3 million, or 6.8%, for its Milwaukee Downtown (Valley) steam utility customers and Milwaukee County steam utility customers, respectively. Wisconsin Gas asked the PSCW to approve a rate increase for its natural gas customers of approximately $38.9 million, or 4.6%.In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed supplemental testimony with the PSCW updating its rate increase request for retail electric customers to reflect the impact of lower sales as a result of the decline in the economy. The effect of the change resulted in Wisconsin Electric increasing its request from $76.5 million to $126.0 million.In December 2009, the PSCW authorized rate adjustments related to Wisconsin Electrics and Wisconsin Gas requests to increase electric, natural gas and steam rates. The PSCW approved the following rate adjustments:An increase of approximately $85.8 million (3.35%) in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric, which was partially offset by bill credits in 2010 and included a decrease in base fuel revenues of approximately $111.0 million, or a fuel rate component decrease of 13.8%;A decrease of approximately $2.0 million (0.35%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric;An increase of approximately $5.7 million (0.70%) for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas; andA decrease of approximately $0.4 million (1.65%) for Wisconsin Electrics Valley steam utility customers and a decrease of approximately $0.1 million (0.47%) for its Milwaukee County steam utility customers.These rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2010. In addition, the PSCW lowered the authorized return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%.The PSCW also made, among others, the following determinations:New depreciation rates were incorporated into the new base rates approved in the rate case;Certain regulatory assets that were scheduled to be fully amortized over four years are instead being amortized over eight years; andWisconsin Electric will continue to receive AFUDC on 100% of Construction Work in Progress for the environmental control projects at our Oak Creek Power Plant and at Edgewater Generating Unit 5, and on the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Wisconsin Electric sold its interest in Edgewater Generating Unit 5 in March 2011 and completed construction of Glacier Hills in December 2011.As part of its final decision in the 2010 rate case, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin Electric to reopen the docket in 2010 to review updated 2011 fuel costs. On September 3, 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed an application with the PSCW to reopen the docket to review updated 2011 fuel costs and to set rates for 2011 that reflect those costs. Wisconsin Electric requested an increase in 2011 Wisconsin retail electric rates of $38.4 million, or 1.4%, related to the increase in 2011 monitored fuel costs as compared to the level of monitored fuel costs then embedded in rates. In December 2010, Wisconsin Electric reduced its request by approximately $5.2 million. Adjustments by the PSCW reduced the request by an additional $7.8 million. The PSCW issued its final decision, which increased annual Wisconsin retail rates by $25.4 million effective April 29, 2011. The net increase was being driven primarily by an increase in the delivered cost of coal. 58Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 K2010 Michigan Rate Increase Request: In July 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the MPSC, primarily to recover the costs of PTF projects. In December 2009, the MPSC approved Wisconsin Electrics modified self implementation plan to increase electric rates in Michigan by approximately $12 million, effective upon commercial operation of OC 1, which occurred on February 2, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the MPSC issued the final order, approving an additional increase of $11.5 million effective July 2, 2010. The combined total increase is $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. In August 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the MPSC regarding this rate order. In October 2010, the MPSC ruled on the mines appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually, effective November 1, 2010. In November 2010, the mines filed a Claim of Appeal of the October 2010 order with the Michigan Court of Appeals. In December 2010, the MPSC filed a Motion for Remand with the Court of Appeals. In March 2011, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion for Remand. All briefs have been filed and the case is awaiting scheduling of oral argument, which we expect to occur in the first quarter of 2012.Limited Rate Adjustment Requests2012 Fuel Recovery Request: On August 3, 2011, Wisconsin Electric filed a $50 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The primary reasons for the increase are projected higher coal, coal transportation and purchased power costs. This filing was made under the new Wisconsin fuel rules which require annual fuel cost filings. On January 5, 2012, the PSCW issued an order which provided for an increase in fuel costs of approximately $26 million, offset by approximately $26 million from the settlement with the DOE regarding the storage of spent nuclear fuel, resulting in no change in customer rates.2010 Fuel Recovery Request: In February 2010, Wisconsin Electric filed a $60.5 million rate increase request with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The increase in fuel and purchased power costs was driven primarily by increases in the price of natural gas compared to the forecasted prices included in the 2010 PSCW rate case order, changes in the timing of plant outages and increased MISO costs. Effective March 25, 2010, the PSCW approved an annual increase of $60.5 million in Wisconsin retail electric rates on an interim basis. On April 28, 2011, the PSCW approved the final increase with no changes.2009 Fuel Order: Under the fuel rules in effect in 2008 and 2009, a Wisconsin utility could request an emergency rate increase if projected costs fell outside of a prescribed range of costs which was plus or minus 2% of the fuel rate approved in a general rate proceeding.In March 2008, Wisconsin Electric filed a request for an emergency rate increase with the PSCW to recover forecasted increases in fuel and purchased power costs. The PSCW authorized a total increase of $118.9 million. In April 2009, Wisconsin Electric filed a request with the PSCW to decrease annual Wisconsin retail electric rates by $67.2 million because it forecasted that its monitored fuel cost for 2009 would fall outside the range prescribed by the PSCW and would be less than the fuel cost reflected in then authorized rates. The PSCW approved this request on an interim basis with rates effective May 1, 2009.The PSCW staff audited the fuel costs for the year 2009 to determine whether Wisconsin Electric collected excess revenues as a result of the fuel surcharges that were in place in 2008 and 2009. Under the fuel rules, if a utility collects excess revenues in a year in which it implemented an emergency fuel surcharge, it is required to refund to customers the over collected fuel surcharge revenue up to the amount of the excess revenues. In February 2011, the PSCW closed out its review of this matter and determined that Wisconsin Electric did not collect any excess revenues.Other Utility Rate MattersOak Creek Air Quality Control System Approval: In July 2008, we received approval from the PSCW granting Wisconsin Electric authority to construct wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities at Oak Creek Power Plant units 5 8. Construction of these emission controls began in late July 2008, and we expect the installation to be completed during 2012. We currently expect the cost of completing this project to be approximately $750 million ($900 million including AFUDC). The cost of constructing these facilities has been included in our previous estimates of the costs to implement the Consent Decree with the EPA.Wisconsin Fuel Rules: Embedded within Wisconsin Electrics base rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. New fuel rules adopted in December 2010 require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any 59Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kunder collection or over collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utilitys symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW set at plus or minus 2% of the utilitys approved fuel cost plan. Fuel cost plans approved by the PSCW after January 1, 2011 are subject to the new rules. The deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.Electric Transmission Cost Recovery: Wisconsin Electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of ATC in January 2001. We now procure transmission service from ATC at FERC approved tariff rates. In connection with the formation of ATC, our transmission costs have escalated due to the socialization of costs within ATC and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in the state. In 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the PSCW issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. We were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs we deferred at our weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had $118.3 million of unrecovered transmission costs. The escrow accounting treatment has been discontinued as our 2008 and 2010 PSCW rate orders have provided for recovery of these costs.Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism: Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. As part of its January 2010 rate order, the PSCW approved changes to the GCRMs. The GCRMs now use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. Costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the PSCW before they can be passed through to our customers. The modified one for one is the same method used by the other utilities in Wisconsin.Depreciation Rates: In January 2009, we filed a depreciation study with the PSCW, proposing new depreciation rates that would reduce annual depreciation expense by approximately $55 million. The PSCW approved the depreciation study and the new depreciation rates began on January 1, 2010. We estimate that the new depreciation rates did not have a material impact on earnings because the new depreciation rates were considered when the PSCW set our 2010 electric and gas rates.Renewables, Efficiency and Conservation: In March 2006, Wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting Act 141. Act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy providers renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. A utilitys renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. Wisconsin Electrics baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. Under Act 141, Wisconsin Electric could not decrease its renewable energy percentage for the years 2006 2009, and for the years 2010 2014, it must increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27%. As of December 31, 2011, we are in compliance with the Wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. Act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. Act 141 establishes a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by December 31, 2015. To comply with increasing requirements, Wisconsin Electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and is in the process of constructing approximately 50 MW of biomass fueled generation. With the commercial operation of the Glacier Hills Wind Park in December 2011 and assuming the biomass project is completed on schedule, we expect to be in compliance with Act 141 through the year 2016. To remain in compliance with Act 141, we would need to construct or contract for the equivalent of approximately 400 MW of additional wind generating capacity beyond 2016. See Renewable Energy Portfolio discussion below for additional information regarding the development of renewable energy generation.Act 141 allows the PSCW to delay a utilitys implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. Act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the PSCW, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency. Prior to Act 141, there had been no agreement on how to determine compliance with the Energy Priorities law, which provides that it is the policy of the PSCW, to the extent it is cost effective and technically feasible, to consider the following options in the listed order when reviewing energy related applications: (1) energy conservation and efficiency, (2) noncombustible renewable energy resources, (3) combustible renewable energy resources, (4) natural gas, (5) oil or low sulfur coal and (6) high sulfur coal and other carbon based fuels.Act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the 60Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KWisconsin Department of Administration back to the PSCW and or contracted third parties. In addition, Act 141 required that 1.5% of utilities annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2011. The funding required by Act 141 decreased to 1.2% of annual operating revenues in 2012. Public Act 295 enacted in Michigan calls for the implementation of a renewable portfolio standard by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. Public Act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost effective.Renewable Energy Portfolio: The Blue Sky Green Field wind farm project, which has 88 turbines with an installed capacity of 145 MW, commenced commercial operation in May 2008. The Glacier Hills Wind Park, which has 90 turbines with an installed capacity of 162 MW, commenced commercial operation in December 2011. We estimate that the final cost of the Glacier Hills Wind Park will be approximately $355 million.We are constructing a biomass fueled power plant at Domtar Corporations Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings will be used to produce approximately 50 MW of renewable electricity and will also support Domtars sustainable papermaking operations. Construction commenced on June 27, 2011. We currently expect to invest between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC, in the plant and we expect the plant to be completed during the fall of 2013.Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was passed in December 2011, utilities are now able to elect to receive a cash grant for renewable energy projects without the effect of normalization for income tax purposes. We are currently evaluating the impact of the NDAA on whether we pursue federal production tax credits or grants for certain of our renewable generation projects.ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITYIn response to customer demand for higher quality power required by modern equipment, we are evaluating and updating our electric distribution system. We are taking steps to reduce the likelihood of outages by upgrading substations and rebuilding lines to upgrade voltages and reliability. These improvements, along with better technology for analysis of our existing system, better resource management to speed restoration and improved customer communication, are near term efforts to enhance our current electric distribution infrastructure. For the long term, we have developed a distribution system asset management strategy that requires increased levels of automation of both substations and line equipment to consistently provide the level of reliability needed for a digital economy.We had adequate capacity to meet all of our firm electric load obligations during 2011 and 2010. All of our generating plants performed well during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non firm customers who participate in load management programs. We expect to have adequate capacity to meet all of our firm load obligations during 2012. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability could require us to call upon load management procedures.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSOverviewConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gas emissions; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.We are continuing to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) developing additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) reviewing water quality matters such as 61Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kdischarge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) adding emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) implementing a Consent Decree with the EPA to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx by more than 65% by 2013; (5) continuing the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal fired generating units; and (6) conducting the clean up of former manufactured gas plant sites.Air QualityEPA Consent Decree: In April 2003, Wisconsin Electric reached a Consent Decree with the EPA, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from certain of its coal fired generating facilities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin approved the amended Consent Decree and entered it in October 2007. The Consent Decree was further amended in January 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the Oak Creek Power Plant to accommodate the AQCS scheduled to begin service in 2012. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.8 hour Ozone Standard: In April 2004, the EPA designated 10 counties in southeastern Wisconsin as non attainment areas for the 8 hour ozone ambient air quality standard. The EPA has since redesignated three of these counties Kewaunee, Manitowoc and Door in attainment with the standard, and has made a finding that the remaining seven counties have achieved attainment with the standard. The EPA has stated, however, that Wisconsin must revise a portion of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to volatile organic compounds, which do not apply to our facilities, before these seven counties can be formally redesignated. Pending redesignation, we will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting standards for new or revised facilities in the affected seven counties.In March 2008, the EPA announced its decision to further lower the 8 hour ozone standard, and in January 2010, the EPA proposed to lower that standard further. However, in September 2011, President Obama requested the EPA to delay the reconsideration of the 8 hour ozone standard until 2013, and the EPA began implementing the 2008 standard. The EPA has stated that it plans to finalize the designations under the 2008 ozone standard by May 31, 2012. The EPA has preliminarily designated Waukesha, Washington, Milwaukee and Racine Counties as being in attainment with the standard. Currently, the only counties in Wisconsin that are proposed for non attainment are Kenosha and Sheboygan Counties.Fine Particulate Standard: In December 2006, a more restrictive federal standard for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) became effective; however, in February 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on the revised standard and remanded it back to the EPA for revision. In October 2009, the EPA designated three counties in southeast Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha and Racine) as not meeting the 2006 daily standard for PM2.5. Wisconsin has submitted a request to the EPA to redesignate these three counties as being in attainment with the 2006 standard. If the EPA denies this request, Wisconsin will be required to develop a SIP and submit it to the EPA for approval, and will need to implement actions to reach attainment in the 2014 2019 time period. The impact of future SIP requirements on our operations, if any, cannot be determined at this time, particularly given the EPAs continued efforts to revise the 2006 standard in light of the D.C. Circuit Courts decision. In a related matter, in August 2010, the Wisconsin Natural Resources Board adopted rules to reflect changes made by the EPA in their regulations regarding the regulation of PM2.5. The rule became effective on January 1, 2011. PM2.5 is proposed to be included as a pollutant used to determine whether a facility is a major source of air pollution. Additionally, any modifications to an existing facility that would result in increases in PM2.5 emissions could trigger pre construction permitting requirements, including requirements to control emissions to levels which represent best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate.Sulfur Dioxide Standard: In June 2010, the EPA issued new hourly SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards that became effective in August 2010. These standards, as modified, represent a significant change from the previous SO2 standards. The new standards, among other things, require attainment designations to be based on modeling rather than monitoring. Traditionally, attainment designations were based on monitored data.Various parties have submitted judicial and administrative challenges to this rule, and litigation is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging, among other things, the stringency of the standards and the EPAs plans to require attainment designations to be based on modeling. 62Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIf the new standards remain in place, we believe that we would not need to make significant capital expenditures at the majority of our generation units because of prior investments in pollution control equipment and technology. However, we believe that the new standards may require us to retire our Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan early because the cost of installing new pollution control equipment at this plant may exceed other alternatives we are currently studying, which include investing in the transmission system in that region, adding new air quality controls and possible shared ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant. The new standards may also require us to make modifications at some of our smaller generation units.Nitrogen Dioxide Standard: In January 2010, the EPA announced a new hourly Nitrogen Dioxide standard, which became effective in April 2010. We are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our coal fired generation facilities until final attainment designations are made and until any potential additional rules are adopted.Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants: On December 16, 2011, the EPA issued the final utility MACT rule (referred to as the MATS rule), which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil fired electric generating units. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the rule on the operation of our existing coal fired generation facilities, as well as alternatives for complying with the rule, we currently estimate our cost to comply with this rule will be approximately $16 million. Based upon our review, the VAPP and Presque Isle Power Plant may require additional modifications. In addition, we believe that our clean air strategy, including the environmental upgrades that have already been constructed and that are currently under construction at our other plants, positions those plants well to meet the rules requirements.Cross State Air Pollution Rule: On August 8, 2011, the EPA issued a final rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), formerly known as the Clean Air Transport Rule. This rule was proposed in 2010 to replace the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which had been remanded to the EPA in 2008. The stated purpose of the CSAPR is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation scheme. On October 14, 2011, the EPA published proposed revisions to CSAPR, which if finalized, would delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the Presque Isle Power Plant and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Even with these proposed revisions, however, the Presque Isle Power Plant may not have been allocated sufficient allowances to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This situation could then put the plant at risk for certain penalties under the rule.The rule was scheduled to become effective January 1, 2012. However, we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule, and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a motion to stay CSAPR pending judicial review of the rule. While the CSAPR is stayed, the CAIR will remain in effect. We are unable to predict the outcome of this review at this time. Wisconsin and Michigan Mercury Rules: Both Wisconsin and Michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury. We have plans in place to comply with those requirements and the costs of these plans are incorporated into our capital and operation and maintenance costs.Clean Air Visibility Rule: The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) in June 2005 to address Regional Haze, or regionally impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units and how BART will be addressed in the 28 states subject to EPAs CAIR. The pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include PM2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, NOx, SO2 and ammonia. Pursuant to the rule, in July 2011, Wisconsin proposed a draft SIP for public comment. Michigan submitted a complete SIP to the EPA, but on December 30, 2011, the EPA proposed to disapprove the portion of the Michigan SIP that related to utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR because the EPA had replaced the CAIR program with CSAPR. In this same proposal, the EPA proposed a partial Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Michigan that would rely on CSAPR for utility reductions of NOx and SO2. Issuance of a final partial FIP to Michigan may not occur while judicial review of CSAPR is pending. The EPA did not take action on the other portions of the Michigan SIP submittal.The BART rules completed by Wisconsin and Michigan, which cover one aspect of the CAVR regulations, are partially based on utility reductions of NOx and SO2 that were expected to occur under CAIR. While the EPA has 63Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 Kexpressed its intention to allow states to consider utility reductions of NOx and SO2 expected under CSAPR in its Regional Haze SIPs, we will not be able to determine final impacts of these rules until judicial review of CSAPR is completed and any subsequent rulemaking activities required as result of that review have been finalized.Climate Change: We continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. We support flexible, market based strategies to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions trading, joint implementation projects and credit for early actions. We support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. Our emissions in future years will continue to be influenced by several actions completed, planned or underway, including:Repowering the Port Washington Power Plant from coal to natural gas fired combined cycle units.Adding coal fired units as part of the Oak Creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.Increasing investment in energy efficiency and conservation.Adding renewable capacity and promoting increased participation in the Energy for Tomorrow renewable energy program.Retirement of coal units 1 4 at the Presque Isle Power Plant.Federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions through legislation and regulation has been, and continues to be, a focus of the President and his administration. Although legislation that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy standards and or energy efficiency standards failed to pass in the U.S. Congress, we expect such legislation to be considered in the future. Any mandatory restrictions on our CO2 emissions that may be adopted by Congress or Wisconsins or Michigans legislature could result in significant compliance costs that could affect future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While climate legislation has yet to be adopted, the EPA is pursuing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions using its existing authority under the CAA. These regulations are expected to impact our ability to do maintenance or modify our existing facilities, and permit new facilities. Depending on the extent of rate recovery and other factors, these rules could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. For additional information, see the caption "We may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions." under Item 1A Risk Factors in this report.Beginning with 2010, we are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities to the EPA under its Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule. For 2010, we reported CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 20.9 million metric tonnes to the EPA. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 22.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011. The level of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by MISO.We are also required to report CO2 amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. For 2010, we reported approximately 9.0 million metric tonnes of CO2 to the EPA related to our distribution and sale of natural gas. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report CO2 emissions of approximately 9.6 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2011.Valley Power Plant: We are exploring various options at VAPP in connection with the new environmental regulations, including converting it from a coal fired plant to a natural gas fired plant. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Water QualityClean Water Act: Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the Best Technology Available (BTA) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The EPA finalized rules for new facilities (Phase I) in 2001. Final rules for cooling water intake systems at existing facilities (Phase II) were promulgated in 2004. However, as a result of litigation, the EPA withdrew the Phase II rule in July 2007 and advised states to use their best professional judgment in making BTA decisions while the rule remains suspended. 64Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.Pension Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate and lump sum conversion rate $4.70.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $5.7In addition to pension plans, we maintain OPEB plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. Each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.OPEB Plan Impact onActuarial Assumption Annual Cost (Millions of Dollars) 0.5% decrease in discount rate $2.30.5% decrease in health care cost trend rate in all future years $(3.1)0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets $1.2Unbilled Revenues: We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe EPA proposed a new Phase II rule on March 28, 2011, which must be finalized by July 27, 2012 in accordance with a judicial settlement entered into by the EPA. Once the rule is final, it will apply to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures other than the Oak Creek expansion, which was permitted under the Phase I rules.The proposed rule would create an impingement mortality reduction standard for all existing facilities. One proposed approach would allow a facility owner to satisfy the BTA requirement with respect to impingement mortality reduction if it demonstrates that its cooling water intake system has a maximum intake velocity of no more than 0.5 feet per second. Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 8, Pleasant Prairie and Port Washington Generating Station all employ technologies that have a cooling water intake withdrawal velocity of less than 0.5 feet per second. We are still evaluating impingement mortality reduction compliance options for the Presque Isle Power Plant and VAPP.The EPA has proposed that the BTA for entrainment mortality reduction be determined on a case by case basis. Therefore, permitting agencies would be required to determine BTA with respect to entrainment on a site specific basis taking into consideration several factors. Because the entrainment reduction standard is a site specific determination, we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet this proposed requirement.Depending on the final requirements of the Phase II rule, we may need to modify the cooling water intake systems at some of our facilities. However, we are not able to make a determination until after the Phase II rule is final.Steam Electric Effluent Guidelines: The federal Steam Electric Effluent guidelines, which regulate waste water discharges, are under review by the EPA. These rules govern discharges of waste water from our power plant processes. The EPA rules are expected to be finalized in 2014. After the promulgation of final rules, it is expected that the WDNR will need to modify Wisconsins rules. The existing Wisconsin state rules for waste water discharge are very stringent, and therefore, the systems that have been installed at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant and the Oak Creek Power Plant use advanced technology. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, of these rules on our facilities at this time.Land QualityProposed New Coal Combustion Products Regulation: We currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially designed landfills. Both Wisconsin and Michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. In June 2010, the EPA issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products. One of the proposed rules classifies the materials as hazardous waste. We submitted comments on the proposed rules in November 2010. The EPA also issued a NODA in October 2011, and we submitted comments on the NODA in November 2011. If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current program.If coal combustion products are classified as hazardous waste and we terminate our coal combustion products utilization program, we could be required to dispose of the coal combustion products at a significant cost to the Company, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, the EPA finalized the Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units rule under the CAA, and finalized a Non Hazardous Secondary Materials Rule. Both of these rules have the potential to negatively affect our ability to reburn coal ash from power plants and landfills. Presently, we have a successful program for reburning coal ash to recover energy and produce a usable fly ash product for the concrete industry.Manufactured Gas Plant Sites: We are voluntarily reviewing and addressing environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Ash Landfill Sites: We aggressively seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. For further information, see Note R Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 65Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market.

FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein.

FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP.

Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage.

However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KLEGAL MATTERSCash Balance Pension Plan: In June 2009, a lawsuit was filed by Alan M. Downes, a former employee, against the Plan in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The complaint alleged that Plan participants who received a lump sum distribution under the Plan prior to their normal retirement age did not receive the full benefit to which they were entitled in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and were owed additional benefits, because the Plan failed to apply the correct interest crediting rate to project the cash balance account to their normal retirement age. In September 2010, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint alleging additional claims under ERISA and adding Wisconsin Energy as a defendant.In November 2011, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs for $45.0 million, and the court promptly issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement. As part of the settlement agreement, we agreed to class certification for all similarly situated plaintiffs. The resolution of this matter resulted in a cost of less than $0.04 per share for 2011 after considering insurance and reserves established in the prior year. We do not anticipate further charges as a result of the settlement, other than certain process related costs we expect to incur to implement the settlement. We expect the court to provide final approval of the settlement agreement in April 2012, and to pay additional benefits to class members promptly after receiving this approval.Stray Voltage: On July 11, 1996, the PSCW issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of Wisconsins investor owned utilities. The order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. Additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.Dairy farmers continue to make claims against Wisconsin Electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the PSCWs order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility companys measurement of stray voltage is below the PSCW "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. Additionally, the Court has held that the PSCW regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. As a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the PSCW "level of concern." In December 2008, a stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric. This lawsuit was settled in May 2011. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Another stray voltage lawsuit was filed against Wisconsin Electric in January 2011, but was dismissed without prejudice by the court on February 21, 2012. We continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.NUCLEAR OPERATIONSUsed Nuclear Fuel Storage and Disposal: During Wisconsin Electrics ownership of Point Beach, Wisconsin Electric was authorized by the PSCW to load and store sufficient dry fuel storage containers to allow Point Beach Units 1 and 2 to operate to the end of their original operating licenses, but not to exceed the original 48 canister capacity of the dry fuel storage facility. The original operating licenses were set to expire in October 2010 for Unit 1 and in March 2013 for Unit 2 before they were renewed and extended by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December 2005.Temporary storage alternatives at Point Beach are necessary until the DOE takes ownership of and permanently removes the used fuel as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund which is composed of payments made by the generators and owners of such waste and fuel. Effective January 31, 1998, the DOE failed to meet its contractual obligation to begin removing used fuel from Point Beach, a responsibility for which Wisconsin Electric paid a total of $215.2 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund over the life of its ownership of Point Beach.In August 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in a lawsuit brought by Maine Yankee and Northern States Power Company that the DOEs failure to begin performance by January 31, 1998 constituted a breach of the Standard Contract, providing clear grounds for filing complaints in the Court of Federal 66Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KClaims. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric filed a complaint in November 2000 against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. In October 2004, the Court of Federal Claims granted Wisconsin Electrics motion for summary judgment on liability. The Court held a trial during September and October 2007 to determine damages. In December 2009, the Court ruled in favor of Wisconsin Electric, granting us more than $50 million in damages. In February 2010, the DOE filed an appeal. We negotiated a settlement with the DOE for $45.5 million, which we received in the first quarter of 2011. This amount, net of costs incurred, is being returned to customers as part of the PSCWs approval of our 2012 fuel recovery request and the MPSCs approval of our interim order for the 2012 Michigan rate case.INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING AND COMPETITIONElectric Utility IndustryThe regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. FERC continues to support large RTOs, which will affect the structure of the wholesale market. To this end, the MISO implemented bid based markets, the MISO Energy Markets, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. The MISO Energy Markets commenced operation in April 2005 for energy distribution and in January 2009 for operating reserves. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. It is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in Wisconsin; however, Michigan has adopted retail choice which potentially affects our Michigan operations. Restructuring in Wisconsin: Electric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. Due to many factors, including relatively competitive electric rates charged by the states electric utilities, the PSCW has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of Wisconsin in recent years.The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date.Restructuring in Michigan: Our Michigan retail customers are allowed to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We have maintained our generation capacity and distribution assets and provide regulated service as we have in the past. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customers power supplier.Competition and customer switching to alternative suppliers in our service territories in Michigan has been limited. With the exception of general inquiries, no alternate supplier activity has occurred in our service territories in Michigan. We believe that this lack of alternate supplier activity reflects our small market area in Michigan, our competitive regulated power supply prices and a general lack of interest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a market for alternative electric suppliers.Electric Transmission and Energy MarketsIn connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which includes the bid based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by Load Serving Entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 67Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage.

Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage.

However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate.

See Note C Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Pension and OPEB: Our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits (described in Note N Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.Changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. 69Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KThe following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage.

Our reported costs of providing these post retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee demographics (age and compensation levels), our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future OPEB costs. OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the OPEB and post retirement costs. Our OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post retirement costs in future periods. Similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate making purposes.The following table reflects OPEB plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage.

However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total utility operating revenues during 2011 of approximately $4.4 billion included accrued utility revenues of $252.7 million as of December 31, 2011.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKSee Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risks and Other Significant Risks in Item 7 of this report, as well as Note L Derivative Instruments and Note M Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning potential market risks to which Wisconsin Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed. 70Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2011 Form 10 K
 
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KIn April 2006, FERC issued an order determining that MISO had not applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges. FERC ordered MISO to resettle all affected transactions retroactive to the commencement of the energy market. In October 2006 and March 2007, we received additional rulings from FERC on these issues. FERCs rulings have been challenged by MISO and numerous other market participants. In July 2007, MISO commenced with the resettlement of the market in response to the orders. The resettlement was completed in January 2008 and resulted in a net cost increase of $7.8 million to us. Several entities filed formal complaints with FERC on the assessment of these charges. We filed in support of these complaints.In November 2007, FERC issued another RSG order related to the rehearing requests previously filed. This order provided a clarification that was contrary to how MISO implemented the last resettlement. Once again, several parties, including Wisconsin Electric, filed for rehearing and or clarification with FERC.In addition, FERC ruled on the formal complaints filed by other entities in August 2007. FERC ruled that the current RSG cost allocation methodology may be unjust and unreasonable and established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007. MISO was ordered to file a new cost allocation methodology by March 2008. MISO filed new tariff language which indicated the new cost allocation methodology cannot be applied retroactively. We extended our previous rehearing/clarification request to include the timeframe from the established refund date through March 2008. In September 2008, FERC set a paper hearing for the formal complaints filed in 2007. FERC ruled on the outstanding rehearing/clarification requests and formal complaints in November 2008. FERCs ruling ordered the resettlements to begin from the date the MISO Energy Markets commenced in order to correct the RSG cost allocation methodology. Additionally, the order also set a new RSG cost allocation effective August 10, 2007. However, numerous entities filed rehearing requests in objection of these rulings. Although MISO requested a postponement of the resettlements until the matter is resolved, the resettlement commenced in March 2009. In May 2009, FERC issued an order denying rehearing on substantive matters for the rate period beginning August 10, 2007. However, FERC modified the effective date of that rate to November 10, 2008, and ordered MISO to cease the ongoing resettlement and to reconcile all invoices and payments therein. Similarly, in June 2009, FERC dismissed rehearing requests, but waived refunds for the period April 25, 2006 through November 4, 2007. FERC also stated for the first time that it was waiving refunds for the period April 1, 2005 through April 24, 2006. We, along with others, have sought rehearing and or appeal of the FERCs May and June 2009 determinations pertaining to refunds. In addition, there are contested compliance matters pending FERC review. The net effects of FERCs rulings are uncertain at this time.As part of MISO, a market based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) and Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs). ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction was completed for the period of June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs should mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.Natural Gas Utility IndustryRestructuring in Wisconsin: The PSCW previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect the changing competitive environment in the natural gas industry. To date, the PSCW has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. However, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the PSCW is presently on hold. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position. 68Wisconsin Energy CorporationITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Contd)2011 Form 10 KACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSNew Pronouncements: See Note B Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for information on new accounting pronouncements.International Financial Reporting Standards: During 2009, the SEC announced a "roadmap" for the potential use by U.S. registrants of IFRS instead of GAAP. The SEC issued a Work Plan to consider specific areas and factors relevant to a determination of whether, when and how the current financial reporting system for U.S. registrants should be transitioned to a system incorporating IFRS. Working under the assumption that the SEC would make a decision in 2011, the Work Plan anticipated that the first time U.S. registrants would report under IFRS would be approximately 2015 or 2016. Since the release of the Work Plan, the SEC has issued several papers discussing the incorporation of IFRS into the U.S. financial reporting system and held a roundtable discussion, but has yet to make a determination regarding IFRS. To the extent the SEC determines to adopt IFRS, if at all, we are currently unable to determine when we would be required to begin using IFRS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:Regulatory Accounting: Our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. The actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non regulated companies would not. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,265.7 million in regulatory assets and $915.9 million in regulatory liabilities. In the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. In this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and OPEB costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. The balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after tax non cash charge to earnings. We continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. In addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates.
