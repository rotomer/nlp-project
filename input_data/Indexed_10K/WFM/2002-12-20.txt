Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Whole Foods Market opened its first store in Texas in 1980 and has expanded its operations to 135 stores as of September 29, 2002 both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We currently have one store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All of our remaining operations are domestic. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2000 are 52 week years and fiscal year 2001 is a 53 week year. In November 2000, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business and related net assets have been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented. The following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2002 2001 2000 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.3 65.2 65.5 Gross profit 34.7 34.8 34.5 Direct store expenses 25.1 25.3 25.0 Store contribution 9.6 9.5 9.4 General and administrative expenses 3.6 3.8 3.4 Pre opening and relocation costs 0.5 0.4 0.6 Store closure and asset disposal costs 0.4 Operating income 5.5 4.9 5.5 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.4 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Investment and other income (loss) 0.1 0.1 (0.4 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 5.2 4.2 4.2 Provision for income taxes 2.1 1.7 1.9 Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 0.2 0.8 Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 3.1 2.3 1.6 Discontinued operations: Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (0.5 ) Gain (loss) on disposal, net of income taxes 0.7 (1.3 ) Income (loss) before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 3.1 3.0 (0.2 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income taxes Net income (loss) 3.1 % 3.0 % (0.3 )% Figures may not add due to rounding. 17 Table of Contents Sales Sales from continuing operations increased 20.7%, 23.6% and 23.2% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, adjusted to reflect a fifty two week period in fiscal year 2001. Sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 10.0%, 9.2% and 8.6% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 8.7%, 8.0% and 7.0% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Comparable and identical store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts, reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market. These increases are due to such factors as customers increasing their amount of purchases with us over time, improvements in overall store execution, stronger brand awareness and increased sales of perishables and private label products. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Our gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 34.7%, 34.8% and 34.5% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit margin in fiscal year 2002 was negatively impacted by lower margins at the Harrys Farmers Market stores which were acquired in October 2001. In all years, gross profit margins were positively affected by increased national buying, category management and private label initiatives, which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis. Additionally, continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement, merchandising and controlling shrink has positively affected gross profit. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in certain departments such as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits. Store Contribution Store contribution consists of gross profit less direct store expenses. Store contribution from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 9.6%, 9.5% and 9.4% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For comparable stores, store contribution from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 10.4%, 9.6% and 10.1% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For all stores, direct store expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.1%, 25.3% and 25.0% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We continue to focus on leveraging of labor and other direct expenses to drive improvement in store contribution. For all years, higher operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Significant increases in health care costs in fiscal year 2002 resulted in increased costs for our self funded health insurance plans. We have taken active steps to reform our benefit plans for fiscal year 2003 to better manage our health insurance costs in the future. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were 3.6%, 3.8% and 3.4% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal year 2002 general and administrative expenses reflect lower amortization expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and the expiration of certain assets related to non competition agreements, which were partially offset by the increased costs of infrastructure for the new South region and increases in other regions and the national office. For fiscal year 2001, general and administrative expenses reflect increases in wage costs and depreciation from investments in information systems. Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings. Pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the thirty days prior to a new store or facility opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. We adopted AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 98 5 Reporting on the Costs of Start up Activities effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In accordance with SOP 98 5, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000 we reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, a one time charge totaling approximately $375,000 after taxes, representing start up costs capitalized at September 26, 1999. We developed and opened eleven stores, one bakehouse and one distribution center in fiscal year 2002, twelve stores in fiscal year 2001 and seventeen stores in fiscal year 2000. Of these, two stores were relocations in both fiscal years 2002 and 2001, and three stores were relocations in fiscal year 2000. Pre opening and relocation costs were approximately $12.5 million, $8.5 million and $10.5 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 18 Table of Contents Store Closure and Asset Disposal Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, we recognized store closure costs totaling approximately $9.4 million related to the decision to close three locations, all of which were previously acquired in multi store transactions. Store closure costs include writedowns of leasehold improvements and store equipment to estimated fair values totaling approximately $5.6 million and estimated lease termination costs and other disposal costs totaling approximately $3.8 million. Substantially all activities other than lease termination related to these store closures were completed in fiscal year 2002. At September 29, 2002, the terminations of operating leases for the three closed locations remain to be completed. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $10.4 million, $17.9 million and $15.1 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 reflects lower average amounts outstanding and lower average interest rates on our $220 million bank line of credit. As of September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn on our bank line of credit. Net interest expense for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 reflects additional amounts outstanding on our bank line of credit. Approximately $90.0 million and approximately $137.0 million was drawn on our bank line of credit at September 30, 2001 and September 24, 2000, respectively. Investment and Other Income (Loss) Investment and other income (loss) for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes interest, rental and other income totaling approximately $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2000, we determined that our preferred stock investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary. As a result, we recognized a $10 million pre tax loss in fiscal year 2000 associated with the writeoff of this investment. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately 40.0% for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 and approximately 44.6% for fiscal year 2000. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2000 reflects the capital loss associated with the writeoff of our $10 million investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. and a corresponding valuation allowance that was established on the related deferred tax asset. Excluding the impact of this investment loss, our effective rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2000 was approximately 39.5%. At September 29, 2002, we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $46 million which will expire in 2020. We consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2001 totaled approximately $5.6 million and consisted primarily of the writedown of our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value and our share of Gaiam.com losses. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that our investment in Gaiam.com had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary due to lower market valuations of Internet related companies. As a result, we recognized a loss of approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value in fiscal year 2001. No change in the carrying amount of our investment or share of Gaiam.com losses was required to be recognized in fiscal year 2002. Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2000 totaled approximately $14.1 million and consisted primarily of our share of WholePeople.com Internet operations losses, including WholePeople.coms investment losses on Internet related preferred and common stock investments totaling approximately $12.4 million. Discontinued Operations In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business has been accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2000, we recorded a loss on disposition of the NatureSmart business totaling approximately $24 million, representing the writedown to estimated net realizable value of the business being discontinued, costs associated with the planned disposal, and estimated loss from operations of the discontinued business through the expected date of disposition, net of income taxes. In May 2001, we completed the sale of all of our interest in NatureSmart for approximately $28 million in cash. In November 2001, we completed the sale of the facility in Thornton, Colorado that was used by NatureSmart for approximately $15 million in cash. The gain on disposal of approximately $16.2 million in fiscal year 2001 consists primarily of proceeds from these sales in excess of the amounts previously estimated and a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued operations, net of taxes. Net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2000 was approximately $9.4 million. 19 Table of Contents Business Combinations On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harrys Farmers Markets, Inc., in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harrys Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002. In February 2000, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Natural Abilities, Inc., which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the Sonoma County, California area, in exchange for approximately $25.7 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill totaling approximately $23.9 million. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning February 14, 2000 through September 29, 2002. Quarterly Results The first quarter consists of 16 weeks, the second and third quarters each consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 12 or 13 weeks. Fiscal year 2002 is a 52 week year with the fourth quarter consisting of 12 weeks. Fiscal year 2001 is a 53 week year with the fourth quarter consisting of 13 weeks. Because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and contains both the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, it typically represents a larger share of our annual sales from existing stores. Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. The historical pattern of quarterly sales and income as a percentage of the annual total may not be indicative of the pattern in future years. The following tables set forth selected quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations information for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001 (in thousands except per share data): First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2002 Sales $ 780,799 $ 622,789 $ 648,763 $ 638,124 Gross profit 264,722 218,099 226,145 224,296 Income from continuing operations 20,141 20,227 22,080 22,043 Net income 20,141 20,227 22,080 22,043 Basic earnings per share: From continuing operations 0.36 0.36 0.39 0.38 Net income 0.36 0.36 0.39 0.38 Diluted earnings per share: From continuing operations 0.34 0.34 0.36 0.36 Net income 0.34 0.34 0.36 0.36 Fiscal Year 2001 Sales $ 643,435 $ 516,660 $ 535,584 $ 576,552 Gross profit 220,518 180,521 187,717 200,998 Income from continuing operations 15,044 14,919 16,120 5,564 Discontinued operations: Gain on disposal, net of income taxes 12,304 3,929 Net income 15,044 27,223 16,120 9,493 Basic earnings per share: From continuing operations 0.28 0.28 0.30 0.10 Net income 0.28 0.51 0.30 0.17 Diluted earnings per share: From continuing operations 0.27 0.27 0.29 0.10 Net income 0.27 0.49 0.29 0.17 Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 includes a writedown of our investments in Gaiam.com totaling approximately $5.5 million. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash from operating activities of approximately $229.1 million, $173.0 million and $124.2 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. The Company has a $220 million revolving line of credit available through July 14, 2003. This credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including the prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock. The credit agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn and approximately $213.9 million was available under the agreement. At September 30, 2001, approximately $90.0 million was drawn and approximately $126.3 million was available under the agreement. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures having a carrying amount of approximately $144.7 million at September 29, 2002. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. Debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 for a purchase price equal to issue price plus accrued original issue discount totaling approximately $147 million, $188 million and $241 million, respectively. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The Companys long term revolving bank line of credit expires on July 14, 2003. In the unlikely event a significant redemption occurs on the put date of March 2, 2003 prior to renewal of the long term line of credit, we intend to settle the debt using common stock. Management has no reason to believe it will not be able to renew the line of credit, but renewal cannot be assured at this time. As a result, if the convertible debentures are put to the Company, the Company will utilize long term debt or shares of common stock to settle this obligation. We also have outstanding at September 29, 2002 approximately $22.9 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $29.0 million and $30.2 million in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, primarily borrowings on our line of credit, was approximately $77.9 million in fiscal year 2000. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.6 million per location. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $750,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors. As of November 29, 2002, we had signed leases for 19 stores averaging approximately 41,000 square feet in size. We will incur additional capital expenditures in fiscal year 2003 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $203.3 million, $156.9 million and $180.7 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisitions or change in status of our outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue which has a put date of March 2, 2003, we do not expect any borrowings on our bank line of credit during fiscal year 2003. We expect that planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. 21 Table of Contents We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories, both retail and wholesale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined by the last in, first out (LIFO) method. LIFO cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 55% of inventories in both fiscal years 2002 and 2001 and was determined using the item cost method for approximately 42% and 43% of inventories in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2001, respectively. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value was approximately $7.1 million and $8.0 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Costs for the balance of inventories, consisting of the manufactured inventories of Allegro Coffee Company, are determined by the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, in June 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, in August 2001. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and other related accounting guidance. SFAS No. 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The provisions of this Statement generally are to be applied prospectively. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, in May 2002. The statement rescinds FASB No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and an amendment of that statement, FASB No. 64, Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements. As a result, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect, on the statement of earnings. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 22 Table of Contents The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, in July 2002. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 146 on our consolidated financial statements. Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, please see Item 1. Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. Item 7(a). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to cash flow and fair value risk from changes in interest rates, which may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations, we attempt to manage our exposures through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our long term debt. Our line of credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings have revolving maturities of less than three months. At September 29, 2002 no amounts were drawn under our line of credit agreement. At September 30, 2001, approximately $90 million was outstanding under our line of credit agreement at an average interest rate of approximately 4.63%. Our senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and have an outstanding balance of $22.9 million and $28.6 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $2.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly. Interest Rate and Market Risk Our subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and an outstanding balance of approximately $144.7 million and $137.6 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $18.2 million. At September 30, 2001, the carrying amount of the convertible debentures exceeded the estimated fair value by approximately $0.6 million. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk We have investments in both common and preferred equity securities of Gaiam.com, a non public Internet company. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. For these investments, our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that these investments had suffered declines in value that were other than temporary due to lower market valuations of Internet related companies. As a result, we recognized losses totaling approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investments in Gaiam.com to their estimated fair values of approximately $3.5 million. The marketable equity investment in Gaiam, Inc. has a cost basis of approximately of $1.2 million and a fair value of approximately $920,000 and $1.2 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 an unrealized loss of approximately $280,000 on the Gaiam, Inc. investment is included as a component of shareholders equity. Gaiam, Inc. common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol GAIA. 23 Table of Contents
