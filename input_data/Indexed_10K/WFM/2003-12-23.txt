Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Whole Foods Market opened its first store in Texas in 1980 and has expanded its operations to 145 stores as of September 28, 2003 both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We currently have one store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All of our remaining operations are domestic. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 are 52 week years and fiscal year 2001 is a 53 week year. In November 2000, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. The NatureSmart business and related net assets were recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, and as of September 28, 2003, substantially all activities associated with discontinued operations have been completed. The following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2003 2002 2001 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.7 65.3 65.2 Gross profit 34.3 34.7 34.8 Direct store expenses 25.2 25.1 25.3 General and administrative expenses 3.2 3.6 3.7 Goodwill amortization 0.1 Pre opening and relocation costs 0.4 0.5 0.4 Store closure and asset disposal costs 0.4 Operating income 5.6 5.5 4.9 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.3 ) (0.4 ) (0.8 ) Investment and other income 0.2 0.1 0.1 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 5.5 5.2 4.2 Provision for income taxes 2.2 2.1 1.7 Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 0.2 Income from continuing operations 3.3 3.1 2.3 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of income taxes 0.7 Net income 3.3 % 3.1 % 3.0 % Figures may not add due to rounding. Sales Sales from continuing operations increased 17.0%, 18.4% and 23.6% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 8.6%, 10.0% and 9.2% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 8.1%, 8.7%, and 8.0% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Our comparable and identical store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts, reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market. These increases are due to such factors as customers increasing their amount of purchases with us over time, improvements in overall store execution, stronger brand awareness and increased sales of perishables and private label products. 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Our gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 34.7%, and 34.8% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross profit margin in fiscal year 2003 reflects higher occupancy costs, including utilities, repairs, and rent, higher LIFO charges compared to the prior year, and market driven pricing strategies. Gross profit margins in fiscal years 2002 and 2001 were negatively impacted by lower margins at the Harrys Farmers Market stores that were acquired in October 2001. In all years, gross profit margins were positively affected by increased national buying, category management and private label initiatives, which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis. Additionally, continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement, merchandising and controlling shrink has positively affected gross profit. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.2%, 25.1% and 25.3% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. We continue to focus on improvements in leveraging of labor, managing health care benefits plan costs and other direct expenses to produce incremental improvements in direct store expense as a percentage of sales. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were 3.2%, 3.6% and 3.7% in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Fiscal year 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to a strong focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels. Fiscal year 2002 general and administrative expenses reflect increased costs of infrastructure for the new South region and increases in other regions and the national office. For fiscal year 2001, general and administrative expenses reflect increases in wage costs and depreciation from investments in information systems. We continue to focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, but do not expect significant additional leverage in fiscal year 2004 over leverage generated in fiscal year 2003. Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings. Pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store or facility opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. We developed and opened 12 stores, one distribution center and one commissary kitchen in fiscal year 2003, 11 stores, one distribution center and one bakehouse in fiscal year 2002, and 12 stores in fiscal year 2001. Of these, two stores were relocations in each of fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. Pre opening and relocation costs were approximately $12.1 million, $12.5 million and $8.5 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Store Closure and Asset Disposal Costs During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, we recognized store closure costs totaling approximately $9.4 million related to the decision to close three locations, all of which were previously acquired in multi store transactions. Store closure costs include writedowns of leasehold improvements and store equipment to estimated fair values totaling approximately $5.6 million and estimated lease termination costs and other disposal costs totaling approximately $3.8 million. Substantially all activities other than lease termination related to these store closures were completed in fiscal year 2002. At September 28, 2003, the terminations of operating leases for two of the closed locations remain to be completed, with remaining occupancy reserves totaling approximately $2.5 million. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $8.1 million, $10.4 million and $17.9 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These reductions in net interest expense reflect decreased utilization of our bank line of credit and lower average interest rates over the three year period. We had no amounts outstanding on our bank line of credit during fiscal year 2003. 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $5.6 million, $2.1 million and $1.6 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During fiscal year 2003, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $3 million as a result of the distribution of our ownership share of gain from the sale of Blooming Prairie Cooperative. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, our equity interest in Gaiam.com was converted into $1.0 million in cash and 250,000 restricted shares of Gaiam, Inc. common stock pursuant to the merger of a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc. into Gaiam.com. Subsequent to this transaction, we recognized losses totaling approximately $1.4 million for other than temporary impairment of our unrestricted and restricted investments in Gaiam, Inc. common stock due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying value of our investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2003, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million that will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately 40.0% for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. At September 28, 2003, we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $46 million that will expire in 2020. We consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2001 totaled approximately $5.6 million and consisted primarily of the writedown of our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value and our share of Gaiam.com losses. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that our investment in Gaiam.com had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary due to lower market valuations of Internet related companies. As a result, we recognized a loss of approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value in fiscal year 2001. No change in the carrying amount of our investment or share of Gaiam.com losses was required to be recognized in fiscal year 2002. During fiscal year 2003, our equity interest in Gaiam.com was converted into $1.0 million in cash and 250,000 restricted shares of Gaiam, Inc. common stock pursuant to the merger of a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc. into Gaiam.com, and losses associated with this investment have been included in our consolidated statements of operations in Investment and Other Income (Loss). Discontinued Operations In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business has been accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. The gain on disposal of approximately $16.2 million in fiscal year 2001 consists primarily of proceeds from the sales of the NatureSmart business and facilities in excess of the amounts previously estimated and a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued operations, net of taxes. At September 28, 2003, substantially all activities associated with discontinued operations have been completed. Business Combinations On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harrys Farmers Markets, Inc., in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harrys Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of these acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for fiscal year 2003 and for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002 for fiscal year 2002. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash from operating activities of approximately $279.5 million, $229.1 million and $173.0 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. We had cash and cash equivalents balances totaling approximately $165.8 million, and $12.6 million at September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively. On March 6, 2003, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of our revolving line of credit from July 14, 2003 to October 1, 2004 and reduce the size of the facility from $220 million to $100 million. The Company believes the reduced facility better matches its currently projected cash needs. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including the prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock, and certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. On November 12, 2003, we amended this agreement to allow for the payment of dividends on common stock. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.20% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 28, 2003, no amounts were drawn under this agreement, and the amount available was effectively reduced to approximately $80.2 million by approximately $19.8 million in outstanding letters of credit. At September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn under this agreement, and the amount available was effectively reduced to approximately $213.9 million by approximately $6.1 million in outstanding letters of credit. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $151.4 million at September 28, 2003. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a conversion rate of 10.640 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing approximately 3,285,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount totaling approximately $147 million, $188 million and $241 million, respectively. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. On January 31, 2003, the Company mailed notice to the holders of its subordinated debentures informing such holders they had the right to surrender the debentures for repurchase by the Company on March 2, 2003 for $476.74 per $1,000 of principal amount at maturity, and that such purchase price would be paid entirely in cash. No debentures were redeemed on March 2, 2003. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. We also have outstanding at September 28, 2003 approximately $17.1 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $46.4 million in fiscal year 2003. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $29.0 million and $30.2 million in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 28, 2003 (in thousands): Total Less than1 Year 1 5 Years After 5Years Convertible debt $ 151,449 $ $ 151,449 $ Senior notes 17,143 5,714 11,429 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 42 20 22 Other contractual obligations 87 87 Operating lease obligations 1,504,213 77,326 372,552 1,054,335 Although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain, the above table assumes convertible debentures will be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following table shows expirations per period on commercial commitments as of September 28, 2003 (in thousands): Total Less than1 Year 1 5 Years After 5Years Credit facility $ 100,000 $ $ 100,000 $ We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company announced its first quarterly dividend on November 12, 2003. A cash dividend of 15 cents per share is payable January 16, 2004 to shareholders of record as of January 6, 2004. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. The Companys bank credit agreement was amended on November 12, 2003 to allow for the payment of dividends on common stock. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three fiscal years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.6 million per location. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $700,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors. As of September 28, 2003, we had signed leases for 35 stores averaging approximately 45,000 square feet in size. We will incur additional capital expenditures during fiscal year 2004 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of three Harrys Farmers Market perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $175.8 million, $203.3 million and $156.9 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisition or change in status of the Companys outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Inventory Valuation We value our inventories, both retail and wholesale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined by the last in, first out (LIFO) method. LIFO cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 55% of inventories and was determined using the item cost method for approximately 42% of inventories in both fiscal years 2003 and 2002. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value was approximately $9.1 million and $7.1 million at September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Costs for the balance of inventories, consisting of the manufactured inventories of Allegro Coffee Company, are determined by the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment on a reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, in July 2002. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 may impact the timing and amounts recognized for any future exit or disposal activities. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. The FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 123, which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require additional disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 effective the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF No. 02 16, Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor. EITF No. 02 16 provides guidance for the accounting for consideration given to a reseller from a vendor. We adopted EITF No. 02 16 on a prospective basis effective the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. As a result of the adoption of EITF No. 02 16, vendor reimbursements for advertisements in excess of identifiable internal advertising costs of approximately $2.4 million received in the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2003, which would have been classified as a reduction of direct store expenses prior to adoption, were reclassified as a reduction of cost of goods sold. We received vendor reimbursements for advertisements in excess of identifiable internal advertising costs of approximately $2.2 million fiscal year 2002 and no amounts in fiscal year 2001. Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, please see Item 1. Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material. Interest Rate Risk We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are of a short term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income. We classify our cash equivalent investments as available for sale and, accordingly, have recorded them at fair value on our balance sheets. We had cash equivalent investments totaling approximately $161.0 million at September 28, 2003 and no cash equivalent investments at September 29, 2002. At September 28, 2003 our cash equivalent investments earned an average interest rate of approximately 2.3%. At September 28, 2003 an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million related to cash equivalent investments was included as a component of shareholders equity. Our senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and had an outstanding balance of $17.1 million and $22.9 million at September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively. At September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly. Interest Rate and Market Risk Our subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $151.4 million and $144.7 million at September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, respectively. At September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $48.9 million and $18.2 million, respectively. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk At September 29, 2002 we had investments in common and preferred equity securities of Gaiam.com, a privately held company, with a carrying value and estimated fair value of approximately $3.5 million and an investment in unrestricted common shares of Gaiam, Inc., a public company, with a cost basis of approximately $1.2 million and a fair value of approximately $0.9 million. We accounted for our investment in Gaiam.com common stock using the equity method and recognized losses of Gaiam.com in proportion to our ownership percentage. We regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During fiscal year 2003, our common and preferred interests in Gaiam.com were converted into $1 million in cash and 250,000 restricted shares of Gaiam, Inc. common stock pursuant to the merger of a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc. into Gaiam.com. During fiscal year 2003 we recognized losses totaling approximately $1.4 million for an other than temporary impairment of our unrestricted and restricted investments in Gaiam, Inc. common stock due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded to adjust our investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value. At September 28, 2003 our unrestricted and restricted shares of Gaiam Inc. had an adjusted cost basis of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $0.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. At September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002 an unrealized loss of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million related to our unrestricted shares was included as a component of shareholders equity. Gaiam, Inc. common stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol GAIA. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2003, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million that will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
