Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 26, 2004, have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties to 163 stores: 154 stores in 28 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; two stores in Canada; and seven stores in the United Kingdom. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 52 week years. Executive Summary Sales for fiscal year 2004 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, an increase of approximately 23% over the prior year, driven by 9% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 14.9%. We experienced sales growth across all regions, all departments and all age classes of stores. We set new weekly sales records in 84% of our stores during fiscal year 2004, and we had sales per gross square foot of $786. Sales for fiscal year 2003 totaled approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately 17% over the prior year, with 11% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 8.6%. Sales for fiscal year 2002 totaled approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately 18% over the prior year, with 16% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 10.0%. Net income totaled $137.1 million, $103.7 million and $84.5 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, increasing year over year by approximately 32%, 23% and 24%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $2.09, $1.66 and $1.40 for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $328.8 million, $279.5 million and $229.1 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our capital expenditures totaled approximately $265.0 million, $173.1 million and $161.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including approximately $155.2 million, $89.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, for new stores. We opened 12 stores during each of fiscal years 2004 and 2003, and opened 11 stores during fiscal year 2002, and we ended fiscal year 2004 with 163 stores. Year over year, total assets increased 27% to $1.5 billion, total liabilities increased 26% to $531 million, and shareholders equity increased 27% to $988 million. At the end of fiscal year 2004, we had $171 million in long term debt and $222 million in total cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. The Company declared its first quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share on November 12, 2003. Four quarterly dividends of 15 cents per share each, or a total of approximately $37.1 million, were declared during fiscal year 2004. The Company announced a 27% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share on November 10, 2004. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2004 2003 2002 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.2 65.7 65.3 Gross profit 34.8 34.3 34.7 Direct store expenses 25.5 25.2 25.1 General and administrative expenses 3.1 3.2 3.6 Pre opening and relocation costs 0.3 0.4 0.5 Operating income 5.9 5.6 5.5 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.4 ) Investment and other income 0.2 0.2 0.1 Income before income taxes 5.9 5.5 5.2 Provision for income taxes 2.4 2.2 2.1 Net income 3.5 % 3.3 % 3.1 % Figures may not add due to rounding. Sales Sales increased 22.8%, 17.0% and 18.4% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 14.9%, 8.6% and 10.0% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes sales for remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 14.5%, 8.1%, and 8.7% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Weighted average square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was approximately 9%, 11% and 16% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe our comparable store sales growth and the ability to open successful stores in diverse markets are due to the broad appeal of our stores, natural and organic products entering the mainstream consciousness, improvements in overall store execution and the growing awareness of our brand. Sales for fiscal year 2004 were positively impacted by the United Food and Commercial Workers union strike at conventional grocery store retailers in Southern California during a span of approximately 20 weeks over our first and second quarters. Nineteen of our stores experienced an increase in sales due to the strike, 18 of which were in the comparable store base during those periods. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 34.8%, 34.3% and 34.7% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. While we always have initiatives in place to drive better purchasing, we usually pass those savings on to our customers as lower prices. Our pricing strategy continues to be market driven in grocery and Whole Body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, and body care), in which we aim to be competitively priced on the same or similar items. Our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality of product available in our stores. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.5%, 25.2% and 25.1% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. We continue to focus on improvements in leveraging of labor, managing health care benefits plan costs and other direct expenses to produce incremental improvements in direct store expense as a percentage of sales. 21 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were 3.1%, 3.2% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Fiscal year 2004 and 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to our strong sales growth and focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels. Fiscal year 2002 general and administrative expenses reflect increased costs of infrastructure for the new South region and increases in other regions and the national office. We continue to focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, but do not expect significant additional leverage in fiscal year 2005 over leverage generated in fiscal year 2004. Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings. Pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store or facility opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Pre opening and relocation costs were approximately $10.5 million, $12.1 million and $12.5 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Stores newly opened and relocated were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 New stores 11 10 9 Relocated stores 1 2 2 Total stores opened 12 12 11 Interest Expense Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $7.2 million, $8.1 million and $10.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These reductions in net interest expense reflect decreased utilization of our bank line of credit and lower average interest rates over the three year period. We had no amounts outstanding on our bank line of credit during fiscal years 2004 or 2003. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $6.5 million, $5.6 million and $2.1 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. During fiscal year 2003, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $3 million as a result of the distribution of our ownership share of gain from the sale of Blooming Prairie Cooperative, and pre tax losses totaling approximately $1.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our common stock investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value for other than temporary impairment due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately 40.0% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. At September 26, 2004, we had domestic net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $32 million which will expire in 2020. We consider it more likely than not that all domestic net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. Business Combinations On January 31, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited (Fresh & Wild) for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. The acquisition of Fresh & Wild, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, provided a platform for expansion of the Whole Foods Market brand in the United Kingdom. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $30.5 million have been recorded as goodwill. The Company also agreed to an additional purchase price consideration contingent on the market price of Company common stock at January 31, 2006. If the market price of Company stock at January 31, 2006 is less than the market price at acquisition of $68.59 per share, those sellers who received and continuously hold through January 31, 2006 Company common stock are eligible to receive an amount, in stock, cash or any combination thereof, equal to the deficit multiplied by the number of shares continuously held. 22 Table of Contents Fresh & Wild results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning February 1, 2004 through September 26, 2004. John Mackey, our Chief Executive Officer and Walter Robb, our Co President and Chief Operating Officer each owned approximately 0.2% of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild and received proceeds totaling approximately $54,000 and $78,000, respectively, as consideration for their ownership interest. On October 27, 2003, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC (Select Fish) in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. All assets acquired relate to a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $1.1 million have been recorded as goodwill. Select Fish results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 27, 2003 through September 26, 2004. On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harrys Farmers Markets, Inc. in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harrys Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of these acquired operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002 and all subsequent periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $328.8 million, $279.5 million and $229.1 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. We had cash and cash equivalent balances, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $221.5 million and $165.8 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. On October 1, 2004, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of our $100 million revolving line of credit to October 1, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness as defined in the agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.15% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 no amounts were drawn under the agreement. The amounts available to the Company under the agreement were effectively reduced to $96.5 million and $80.2 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $3.5 million and $19.8 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $158.8 million and $151.4 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a conversion rate of 10.640 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing approximately 3,280,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount totaling approximately $188 million and $241 million, respectively. No debentures were redeemed at the option of the holder on the potential redemption date of March 2, 2003. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. We also have outstanding senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly with a carrying amount of approximately $11.4 million and $17.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Principal on the 23 Table of Contents senior notes is payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $22.9 million and $46.4 million in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $29.0 million in fiscal year 2002. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 26, 2004 (in thousands): Total Less than1 Year 1 5 Years After5 Years Convertible debt $ 158,791 $ $ 158,791 $ Senior notes 11,429 5,714 5,715 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 582 286 296 Operating lease obligations 2,023,958 103,117 475,968 1,444,873 Although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain, the above table assumes convertible debentures will be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008. The following table shows expirations per period on commercial commitments as of September 26, 2004 (in thousands): Total Less than1 Year 1 5 Years After5 Years Credit facility $ 100,000 $ $ 100,000 $ We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company declared its first quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share on November 12, 2003. Four quarterly dividends totaling 60 cents per share, or a total of approximately $37.1 million, were declared during fiscal year 2004. The Company announced a 27% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share on November 10, 2004. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three fiscal years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.2 million per location. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $800,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors, and pre opening expenses, which have averaged approximately $640,000 per store over the past three fiscal years. As of November 10, 2004, we had signed leases for 53 stores averaging approximately 49,000 square feet in size. The following table provides information about the Companys stores under development: November 10,2004 November 12,2003 Stores 53 35 Average store size (gross square feet) 49,000 45,000 As a percentage of existing store average size 155 % 143 % Total square footage under development 2,600,000 1,600,000 As a percentage of existing square footage 50 % 35 % We will incur additional capital expenditures during fiscal year 2005 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company loaned $13.5 million to a third party real estate developer in connection with the construction of a new Company store. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, for a 24 Table of Contents total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC, which owned and operated a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington, in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of three Harrys Farmers Market perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $319.2 million, $175.8 million and $203.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisition or change in status of the Companys outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for approximately 94.2% and 96.4% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $11.2 million and $9.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Costs for the balance of inventories are determined by the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 50% and 56% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately 50% and 44% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. We believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value 25 Table of Contents method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF No. 03 10, Application of Issue No. 02 16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, in November 2003. EITF Issue No. 03 10 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers, including manufacturer coupons. EITF Issue No. 03 10 became effective the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 03 10 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see Item 1. Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments, notes receivable and long term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material. Interest Rate Risk We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are of a short term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income. We classify our cash equivalent investments as available for sale and, accordingly, have recorded them at fair value on our balance sheets. We had cash equivalent investments totaling approximately $184.1 million and $162.0 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, our cash equivalent investments earned an average interest rate of approximately 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, an unrealized loss of approximately $0.4 million and an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million, respectively, related to cash equivalent investments was included as a component of shareholders equity. Our notes receivable and senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The notes receivable earn interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% and had a carrying amount and fair value of approximately $13.5 million at September 26, 2004. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and had an outstanding balance of $11.4 million and $17.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly. Interest Rate and Market Risk Our subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $158.8 million and $151.4 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $137.1 million and $48.9 million, respectively. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in Gaiam, Inc for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. Our investments in Gaiam, Inc., a public company, consisted of 80,000 unrestricted common shares, which were classified as available for sale securities and 250,000 restricted common shares, for which we accounted using the cost method. During fiscal year 2003 we recognized losses totaling approximately $1.4 million for other than temporary impairment of our unrestricted and restricted investments in Gaiam, Inc. common stock due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value.
