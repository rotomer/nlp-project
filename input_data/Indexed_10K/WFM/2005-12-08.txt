Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 25, 2005, have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties to 175 stores: 165 stores in 30 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; three stores in Canada; and seven stores in the United Kingdom. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 52 week years. In October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. The Company historically capitalized rental costs incurred during a construction period. In accordance with the transition provisions of FSP 13 1, the Company elected to early adopt and retrospectively apply in these financial statements the requirement to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the early adoption and retrospective application of the lease accounting change, which is further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis incorporates the effects of this lease accounting change. Executive Summary The Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options on September 22, 2005 in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company incurred a share based compensation charge totaling approximately $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, primarily a non cash charge related to this accelerated vesting of options. The Companys effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 was higher than its historical rate primarily due to the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options. The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and accordingly the Company recorded expenses totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. Sales for fiscal year 2005 totaled approximately $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately 22% over the prior year, driven by 13% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 12.8%. We experienced sales growth across all regions, all departments and all age classes of stores. We had sales per gross square foot of $869, an increase of approximately 11% over the prior year. Sales for fiscal year 2004 totaled approximately $3.9 billion, an increase of approximately 23% over the prior year, with 9% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 14.9%. Sales for fiscal year 2003 totaled approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately 17% over the prior year, with 11% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 8.6%. Net income totaled $136.4 million, $129.5 million and $98.9 million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing year over year by approximately 5%, 31% and 24%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share totaled $1.98, $1.98 and $1.58 for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash flows from operations totaled approximately $410.8 million, $330.3 million and $281.0 million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our capital expenditures totaled approximately $324.1 million, $266.5 million and $174.7 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including approximately $207.8 million, $156.7 million and $90.6 million, respectively, for new stores. We opened 15 new stores during fiscal year 2005 and 12 new stores during each of fiscal years 2004 and 2003, and we ended fiscal year 2005 with 175 stores. Year over year, total assets increased 24% to $1.9 billion, total liabilities decreased 8% to $524 million, and shareholders equity increased 44% to $1.4 billion. At the end of fiscal year 2005, we had $18.9 million in long term debt and $345.4 22 Table of Contents million in total cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. Approximately $150.1 million of the carrying amount of the Companys zero coupon subordinated debentures was voluntarily converted by holders to shares of Company common stock during fiscal year 2005. The Companys Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends during fiscal year 2005. The first dividend was $0.19 per share, and the remaining three dividends were $0.25 per share, for a total of approximately $62.5 million. The Company declared its first quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on November 12, 2003. The Companys Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share each, for a total of approximately $37.1 million, during fiscal year 2004. The Company announced a 20% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share and a special dividend of $4.00 per share on November 9, 2005. These dividend amounts do not reflect the effect of the future two for one stock split announced on November 9, 2005. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2005 2004 2003 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 64.9 65.3 65.8 Gross profit 35.1 34.7 34.2 Direct store expenses 26.0 25.5 25.2 General and administrative expenses 3.4 3.1 3.2 Pre opening and relocation costs 0.8 0.5 0.5 Operating income 4.9 5.6 5.3 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Investment and other income 0.2 0.2 0.2 Income before income taxes 5.0 5.6 5.2 Provision for income taxes 2.1 2.2 2.1 Net income 2.9 % 3.4 % 3.1 % Figures may not add due to rounding. Share based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires all companies to recognize an expense for share based payments, including stock options, based on the fair value of the equity instrument. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a final rule amending Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation S X amending the compliance date for FASB Statement No. 123(R) to be effective starting with the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R) will be effective for the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Though not retroactive, the charge to earnings resulting from this rule includes the impact of stock options granted prior to its effective date, since the expense is recognized over the vesting period of the options, which for the Company historically has been four years. On September 22, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company recognized a share based compensation charge totaling approximately $17.4 million related to this acceleration, of which approximately $10.1 million is included in Direct store expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, approximately $6.1 million is included in General and administrative expenses, and approximately $1.2 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs. The Company also recognized share based compensation in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $2.5 million for modification of terms of certain stock option grants and other compensation based on the intrinsic value of the Companys common stock, which is included in General and administrative expenses. The Companys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 was higher than its historical rate primarily due to the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options. Natural Disaster Costs The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and accordingly the Company recorded expenses totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. The main components of the $16.5 million expense were estimated impaired assets totaling approximately $12.2 million, estimated inventory losses totaling approximately $2.5 million, salaries and relocation 23 Table of Contents allowances for displaced Team Members and other costs totaling approximately $3.4 million, and a $1 million special donation from the Company to the American Red Cross, net of accrued estimated insurance proceeds totaling approximately $2.6 million. Approximately $13.4 million of net natural disaster costs is included in Direct store expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, approximately $1.0 million is included in General and administrative expenses, and approximately $2.1 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs. Future determinations regarding asset losses and insurance recoveries could cause actual net losses to differ from these estimates. Sales Sales totaled approximately $4.701 billion, $3.865 billion and $3.149 billion in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing increases of 21.6%, 22.8% and 17.0% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 12.8%, 14.9% and 8.6% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes sales for remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 11.5%, 14.5% and 8.1% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Weighted average square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was approximately 13%, 9% and 11% for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stores closed for eight or more days due to unusual events such as fires, snowstorms or hurricanes are excluded from the comparable and identical store base in the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. We believe our comparable store sales growth and the ability to open successful stores in diverse markets are due to the broad appeal of our stores, natural and organic products entering the mainstream consciousness, improvements in overall store execution and the growing awareness of our brand. Sales for fiscal year 2004 were positively impacted by the United Food and Commercial Workers union strike at conventional grocery store retailers in Southern California during a span of approximately 20 weeks over our first and second quarters. Nineteen of our stores experienced an increase in sales due to the strike, 18 of which were in the comparable store base during those periods. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Gross profit totaled approximately $1.649 billion, $1.341 billion and $1.078 billion in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 35.1%, 34.7% and 34.2% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. While we always have initiatives in place to drive better purchasing, we usually pass those savings on to our customers as lower prices. Our pricing strategy continues to be market driven in grocery and Whole Body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, and body care), in which we aim to be competitively priced on the same or similar items. Our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality of product available in our stores. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $1.223 billion, $986.0 million and $794.4 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 26.0%, 25.5% and 25.2% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in increased fiscal year 2005 principally due to share based compensation costs totaling approximately $10.1 million and natural disaster costs totaling approximately $13.4 million. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $158.9 million, $119.8 million and $100.7 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.4%, 3.1% and 3.2% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal year 2005 principally due to share based compensation costs totaling approximately $8.6 million and natural disaster costs totaling approximately $1.0 million. Fiscal year 2004 and 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to our strong sales growth and focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels. The Company does not expect significant leveraging of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 below historical levels. 24 Table of Contents Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and other costs related to new store openings, including costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred for six months prior to a stores opening date. Other pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Pre opening and relocation costs totaled approximately $37.0 million, $18.6 million and $15.8 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Pre opening and relocation costs as a percentage of sales were 0.8%, 0.5% and 0.5% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stores newly opened and relocated were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 New stores 12 11 10 Relocated stores 3 1 2 Total stores opened 15 12 12 The Company expects average pre opening costs per new store in fiscal year 2006 to be in the range of approximately $1.7 million to $2.0 million. The Companys average pre opening costs per store have increased over the past several years and are expected to continue to increase in the future due mainly to increases in the average store size and number of prepared foods venues, and to an increase in our internal capitalization thresholds resulting in the expensing of smallwares that were previously capitalized. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $2.2 million, $7.2 million and $8.1 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These reductions in net interest expense reflect decreased utilization of our bank line of credit and lower average interest rates over the three year period. We had no amounts outstanding on our bank line of credit during fiscal years 2005 or 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $9.6 million, $6.5 million and $5.6 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. During fiscal year 2003, we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $3 million as a result of the distribution of our ownership share of gain from the sale of Blooming Prairie Cooperative, and pre tax losses totaling approximately $1.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our common stock investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value for other than temporary impairment due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income was approximately 42.5%, 40.0% and 40.0% for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily from the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options during the fourth quarter. As of September 25, 2005 we had domestic net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $18.5 million which will begin to expire in 2019, and international operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $31 million, of which $13.6 million will begin to expire in 2008 and $17.5 million that have an indefinite life. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the remaining domestic deferred tax assets in the form of future tax deductions based on the nature of these deductible temporary differences and a history of profitable operations. We have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $17.4 million for deferred tax assets associated with international operating loss carrryforwards and capital loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Business Combinations On January 31, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited (Fresh & Wild) for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. The 25 Table of Contents acquisition of Fresh & Wild, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, provided a platform for expansion of the Whole Foods Market brand in the United Kingdom. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $30.5 million were recorded as goodwill. The Company also agreed to an additional purchase price consideration contingent on the market price of Company common stock at January 31, 2006. If the market price of Company stock at January 31, 2006 is less than the market price at acquisition of $68.59 per share, those sellers who received and continuously hold Company common stock through January 31, 2006 are eligible to receive an amount, in stock, cash or any combination thereof, equal to the deficit multiplied by the number of shares continuously held. Fresh & Wild results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning February 1, 2004 through September 26, 2004 and all subsequent periods. John Mackey and Walter Robb, executive officers of the Company, each owned approximately 0.2% of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild and received proceeds totaling approximately $54,000 and $78,000, respectively, in consideration for their ownership interest. On October 27, 2003, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC (Select Fish) in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. All assets acquired relate to a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $1.1 million have been recorded as goodwill. Select Fish results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 27, 2003 through September 26, 2004 and all subsequent periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $410.8 million, $330.3 million and $281.0 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. We had cash and cash equivalent balances, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $345.4 million and $221.5 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. On October 1, 2004, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of our $100 million revolving line of credit to October 1, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness as defined in the agreement. At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.15% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004 no amounts were drawn under the agreement. The amounts available to the Company under the agreement were effectively reduced to $88.4 million and $96.5 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $11.6 million and $3.5 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. On November 7, 2005, we amended our credit facility to delete redemption, dividends and distributions negative covenants to allow for the special dividend. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $12.9 million and $158.8 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. The debentures have a conversion rate of 10.640 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, or approximately 253,000 shares and 3,279,000 shares at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. Approximately $150.1 million and $0.3 million of the carrying amount of the debentures was voluntarily converted by holders to shares of Company common stock during fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. 26 Table of Contents We also have outstanding senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly with a carrying amount of approximately $5.7 million and $11.4 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. The remaining principal on the senior notes is payable on May 16, 2006. Net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of stock options by team members totaled approximately $85.8 million, $59.5 million and $52.3 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Due to the accelerated vesting of stock options on September 22, 2005, the Company expects a higher rate of stock option exercises in fiscal year 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $25.2 million, $22.9 million and $46.4 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 25, 2005 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1 5 Years After 5 Years Convertible debt $ 12,850 $ $ 12,850 $ Senior notes 5,714 5,714 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 319 229 90 Operating lease obligations 3,488,902 122,766 729,657 2,636,479 Although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain, the above table assumes convertible debentures, shown at accreted value as of September 25, 2005, will be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008. The following table shows expirations per period on commercial commitments as of September 25, 2005 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1 5 Years After 5 Years Credit facility $ 100,000 $ $ 100,000 $ We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Following is a summary of dividends declared in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Date of Declaration Dividend per Share Date of Record Date of Payment Total Amount 2005 November 10, 2004 $ 0.19 January 7, 2005 January 17, 2005 $ 12,088 April 5, 2005 0.25 April 15, 2005 April 25, 2005 16,345 June 7, 2005 0.25 July 15, 2005 July 25, 2005 16,834 September 14, 2005 0.25 October 14, 2005 October 24, 2005 17,208 (1) 2004 November 12, 2003 $ 0.15 January 6, 2004 January 16, 2004 $ 9,079 March 22, 2004 0.15 April 9, 2004 April 19, 2004 9,234 June 29, 2004 0.15 July 9, 2004 July 19, 2004 9,415 September 22, 2004 0.15 October 8, 2004 October 18, 2004 9,417 (1) Dividends accrued at September 25, 2005 On November 9, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share and a special dividend of $4.00 per share, both payable on January 23, 2006 to shareholders of record on January 13, 2006. These dividend amounts do not reflect the effect of the future two for one stock split announced on November 9, 2005. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company expects to pay approximately $363 million in cash dividends to shareholders in fiscal year 2006. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. 27 Table of Contents On November 9, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million over the next four years. The specific timing and repurchase amounts will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Companys available cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $340 million to $360 million during fiscal year 2006, of which approximately 60% will be related to new stores. The following table provides information about the Companys stores under development: November 9,2005 November 10,2004 Stores 65 53 Average store size (gross square feet) 55,000 49,000 As a percentage of existing store average size 164 % 155 % Total square footage under development 3,600,000 2,600,000 As a percentage of existing square footage 60 % 50 % We will incur additional capital expenditures during fiscal year 2006 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC, which owned and operated a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington, in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $322.2 million, $324.3 million and $177.4 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisition or significant change in market conditions, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 28 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for approximately 94.1% and 94.2% of inventories in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $10.7 million and $11.1 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. Costs for remaining inventories are determined by the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 54% and 50% of inventories in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately 46% and 50% of inventories in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Income Taxes We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant accounting judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period. FSP No. FAS 13 1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense. FSP FAS 13 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The transition provisions of FSP No. FAS 13 1 permit early adoption and retrospective application of the guidance. The Company historically capitalized rental costs incurred during a construction period. In accordance with the transition provisions of FSP 13 1, the Company elected to early adopt and retrospectively apply in these financial statements the requirement to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the early adoption and retrospective application of the lease accounting change, which is further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change, and that indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after the date the statement was issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 beginning in fiscal year 2007. 29 Table of Contents In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share based Payments. SFAS No. 123R revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R applies to transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and also applies to liabilities an entity may incur for goods or services that are based on the fair value of those equity instruments. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique, or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 using the modified prospective application. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of FAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will require the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. In addition, SFAS No. 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flows from operating activities. The Company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place, but going forward the Companys intention is to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that net income dilution from equity based compensation expense in future years would not exceed 10%. The Company believes this strategy is best aligned with its stakeholder philosophy because it is intended to limit future earnings dilution from options while at the same time retains the broad based stock option plan, which it believes is important to Team Member morale and to its unique corporate culture and its success. Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments, notes receivable and long term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material. Interest Rate Risk We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are of a short term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income. We classify our cash equivalent investments as available for sale and, accordingly, have recorded them at fair value on our balance sheets. We had cash equivalent investments totaling approximately $325.7 million and $184.1 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively, which earned an average interest rate of approximately 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively. At September 26, 2004, an unrealized loss of approximately $0.4 million related to cash equivalent investments was included as a component of shareholders equity. During fiscal year 2005, we collected all amounts outstanding on our notes receivable. The notes receivable earned interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% and had a carrying amount and fair value of approximately $13.5 million at September 26, 2004. Our senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $5.7 million and $11.4 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly. 30 Table of Contents Interest Rate and Market Risk Our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. During fiscal year 2005 approximately 92%, or approximately $150.1 million of the carrying amount, of the debentures were converted, at the option of the holder, into Company common stock. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $12.9 million and $158.8 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $21.8 million and $137.1 million, respectively. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in Gaiam, Inc for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. Our investments in Gaiam, Inc., a public company, consisted of 80,000 unrestricted common shares, which were classified as available for sale securities and 250,000 restricted common shares, for which we accounted using the cost method. 31 Table of Contents
