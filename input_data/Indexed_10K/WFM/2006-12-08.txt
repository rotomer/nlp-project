Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. General Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 24, 2006, have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties to 186 stores: 177 stores in 31 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; three stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 52 week years. Fiscal Year 2006 Executive Summary Sales for fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $5.6 billion, an increase of approximately 19.3% over the prior year, driven by 14% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 11.0%. Average weekly sales for all stores in fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $593,000, an increase of approximately 10.5% over prior year. We had sales per gross square foot of $899, an increase of approximately 3.5% over the prior year. Net income for fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $203.8 million, an increase of approximately 49.5% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 per share totaled $1.41, increasing approximately 42.4% over the prior year . Cash flows from operations for fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $452.7 million. Our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $340.2 million, of which approximately $208.6 million was for new store development. We opened 13 new stores during fiscal year 2006, and we ended the fiscal year with 186 stores. At the end of fiscal year 2006, we had approximately $8.6 million in long term debt, $62.3 million in cash and cash equivalent balances including restricted cash, and short term investments in available for sale securities totaling approximately $193.8 million. The Companys Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share during fiscal year 2006, for a total of approximately $341.0 million. On September 27, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that was paid on October 23, 2006 to shareholders of record on October 13, 2006. On November 2, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share payable on January 22, 2007 to shareholders of record on January 12, 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006. The average price per share paid was $49.85, for a total of approximately $100 million. On November 6, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Companys stock repurchase program, bringing the total remaining authorization to $200 million over the next three years. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2006 2005 2004 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.1 64.9 65.3 Gross profit 34.9 35.1 34.7 Direct store expenses 25.4 26.0 25.5 General and administrative expenses 3.2 3.4 3.1 Pre opening and relocation costs 0.7 0.8 0.5 Operating income 5.7 4.9 5.6 Other income (expense): Interest expense (0.2 ) Investment and other income 0.4 0.2 0.2 Income before income taxes 6.1 5.0 5.6 Provision for income taxes 2.4 2.1 2.2 Net income 3.6 % 2.9 % 3.4 % Figures may not add due to rounding. Sales Sales totaled approximately $5.61 billion, $4.70 billion and $3.86 billion in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, representing increases of 19.3%, 21.6% and 22.8% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 11.0%, 12.8% and 14.9% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes sales for remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 10.3%, 11.5% and 14.5% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days due to unusual events such as fires, snowstorms or hurricanes are excluded from the comparable and identical store base in the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. Weighted average square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was approximately 14%, 13% and 9% for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Sales for fiscal year 2004 were positively impacted by the United Food and Commercial Workers union strike at conventional grocery store retailers in Southern California during a span of approximately 20 weeks over our first and second quarters. Nineteen of our stores experienced an increase in sales due to the strike, 18 of which were in the comparable store base during those periods. The Company believes its comparable store sales growth and the ability to open successful stores in diverse markets are due to the broad appeal of our stores, natural and organic products entering the mainstream consciousness, improvements in overall store execution and the growing awareness of our brand. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Gross profit totaled approximately $1.96 billion, $1.65 billion and $1.34 billion in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 34.9%, 35.1% and 34.7% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. We continue to find many opportunities to lower our cost of goods sold, and we selectively pass on those savings to our customers through lower prices. While our customers are not primarily focused on price, we are always seeking ways to improve our value image and aim to be competitively priced on a market by market basis on commodity type products and on identical product brands in grocery and Whole Body; however, our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality, broader selection, and better customer service available in our produce, meat, seafood, bakery, specialty and prepared foods departments. One way we have improved our value to customers is through our private label products, which give us an opportunity to lower our prices through our scale and buying practices. We are committing additional resources to our private label team and expect private label to grow to a much higher percentage of our sales over time. 24 Table of Contents Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $1.42 billion, $1.22 billion and $986.0 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.4%, 26.0% and 25.5% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales increased fiscal year 2005 principally due to share based compensation costs totaling approximately $10.1 million and natural disaster costs totaling approximately $13.4 million. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $181.2 million, $158.9 million and $119.8 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.2%, 3.4% and 3.1% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal year 2005 principally due to share based compensation costs totaling approximately $8.6 million and natural disaster costs totaling approximately $1.0 million. Fiscal year 2004 general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to our strong sales growth and focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels. The Company does not expect significant leveraging of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2007 below historical levels. Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and other costs related to new store openings, including costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred approximately nine months prior to a stores opening date. Other pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Pre opening and relocation costs totaled approximately $37.4 million, $37.0 million and $18.6 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pre opening and relocation costs as a percentage of sales were 0.7%, 0.8% and 0.5% in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Stores newly opened and relocated were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 New stores 11 12 11 Relocated stores 2 3 1 Total stores opened 13 15 12 The Company expects total pre opening and relocation costs for fiscal year 2007 to range from approximately $68 million to $74 million. This significant year over year increase is due primarily to the anticipated acceleration in leases tendered and square footage opening in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, including the opening of 18 to 20 new stores in fiscal year 2007. Approximately $18 million to $24 million of this total relates to stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008. These ranges are based on estimated tender dates which are subject to change. The Company expects significantly higher than average pre opening expense in fiscal year 2007 partially due to approximately $7 million related to its first Whole Foods Market store in London. Excluding this store, the Company expects total pre opening and relocation expense for stores opening in fiscal year 2007 to average approximately $2.4 million per store, above the Companys average of approximately $1.9 million for stores opened in fiscal year 2006 due primarily to higher accelerated depreciation related to relocations. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $32,000, $2.2 million and $7.2 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These reductions in net interest expense reflect decreases in the carrying amount of our convertible subordinated debentures resulting from the voluntary conversion by debenture holders to shares of Company common stock over the three year period. Additionally, the Company made the final principal payment of approximately $5.7 million to retire its senior notes on May 16, 2006. The Company had no amounts outstanding on its bank line of credit during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $20.7 million, $9.6 million and $6.5 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These increases 25 Table of Contents in investment and other income primarily result from higher yields on investments and higher average investment balances. Investment and other income for fiscal year 2006 includes approximately $2.1 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina losses. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income was approximately 40.0%, 42.5% and 40.0% for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily from the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options during the fourth quarter. As of September 24, 2006 we had international operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $32.5 million, of which approximately $11.8 million will begin to expire in fiscal year 2008 and approximately $20.7 million has an indefinite life. We have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $13.3 million for deferred tax assets associated with international operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Share based Compensation The Company recognized share based compensation costs totaling approximately $19.9 million in fiscal year 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company recognized an estimated share based compensation charge totaling approximately $17.4 million in fiscal year 2005 related to this acceleration, of which approximately $10.1 million is included in Direct store expenses, approximately $6.1 million is included in General and administrative expenses, and approximately $1.2 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs. The Company also recognized share based compensation in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $2.5 million for modification of terms of certain stock option grants and other compensation based on the intrinsic value of the Companys common stock, which is included in General and administrative expenses. The Companys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 was higher than its historical rate primarily due to the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires all companies to recognize an expense for share based payments, including stock options, based on the fair value of the equity instrument. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a final rule amending Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation S X amending the compliance date for SFAS No. 123R to be effective starting with the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R were effective for the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Company recognized share based compensation costs under the requirements of SFAS No. 123R totaling approximately $9.4 million in fiscal year 2006, of which approximately $3.6 million is included in Direct store expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, approximately $5.5 million is included in General and administrative expenses, and approximately $0.3 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs. Included in the 2006 total expense is approximately $1.2 million for modification of terms of certain stock option grants and approximately $3.0 million to increase the estimated charge related to the 2005 acceleration based on actual experience. The Company expects share based compensation of approximately $2 million to $3 million per quarter in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2007 and approximately $3 million to $4 million per quarter in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year following the Companys annual grant date early in the third quarter, when the majority of options are granted. Natural Disaster Costs The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and accordingly the Company recorded expenses totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. The main components of the $16.5 million expense were estimated impaired assets totaling approximately $12.2 million, estimated inventory losses totaling approximately $2.5 million, salaries and relocation allowances for displaced Team Members and other costs totaling approximately $3.4 million, and a $1.0 million special donation from the Company to the American Red Cross, net of accrued estimated insurance proceeds totaling approximately $2.6 million. In fiscal year 2005, approximately $13.4 million of net natural disaster costs is included in Direct store expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, approximately $1.0 million is included in General and administrative expenses, and approximately $2.1 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs. In fiscal year 2006, the Company recognized approximately $7.2 million in pre tax credits for insurance proceeds and other 26 Table of Contents adjustments related to previously estimated Hurricane Katrina losses, of which approximately $4.2 million is included in Direct store expenses, approximately $0.9 million is included in Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs, and approximately $2.1 million is included in Investment and other income. Business Combinations On January 31, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited (Fresh & Wild) for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 477,470 shares. The acquisition of Fresh & Wild, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, provided a platform for expansion of the Whole Foods Market brand in the United Kingdom. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $30.5 million were recorded as goodwill. Fresh & Wild results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning February 1, 2004 through September 26, 2004 and all subsequent periods. John Mackey and Walter Robb, executive officers of the Company, each owned approximately 0.2% of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild and received proceeds totaling approximately $54,000 and $78,000, respectively, in consideration for their ownership interest. On October 27, 2003, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC (Select Fish) in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. All assets acquired relate to a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly the purchase price was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $1.1 million have been recorded as goodwill. Select Fish results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements beginning October 27, 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $452.7 million, $410.8 million and $330.3 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of fiscal year 2006, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 15, Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option. SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow. The Companys excess tax benefit received upon exercise of nonqualified team member stock options totaled approximately $52.0 million in fiscal year 2006. We had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling approximately $2.3 million and $308.5 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $569.3 million, $322.2 million and $324.3 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At September 24, 2006, the Company had short term investments in available for sale securities totaling approximately $193.8 million. These investments are generally state and local government obligations with effective maturities of less than 90 days. The Company also had approximately $60.0 million in restricted cash at September 24, 2006. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 477,470 shares. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC, which owned and operated a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington, in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled approximately $340.2 million, $324.1 million and $266.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $208.6 million, $207.8 million and $156.7 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $131.6 million, $116.3 million and $109.7 million, respectively, was for remodels and other additions. Cash flows from investing activities for fiscal year 2006 include approximately $3.3 million in insurance proceeds related to property and equipment. 27 Table of Contents The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Stores OpenedDuring FiscalYear 2006 Leases Tendered as ofNovember 2, 2006 Total Leases Signed as ofNovember 2, 2006 Number of stores (including relocations) 13 13 88 Number of relocations 2 1 18 New markets 4 2 21 Average store size (gross square feet) 50,200 53,200 56,000 As a percentage of existing store average size 147 % 154 % 162 % Total square footage 653,000 691,000 5,003,000 As a percentage of existing square footage 10 % 11 % 77 % Average pre opening expense per store $ 1.9 million Average pre opening rent per store $ 0.7 million Average tender period 7.8 months The Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 to be in the range of approximately $525 million to $575 million, of which approximately 70% to 75% is related to new stores expected to open in fiscal year 2007 and beyond. The remaining portion will consist of capital expenditures during fiscal year 2007 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. Absent any significant cash acquisition or significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by cash generated from the expected results of operations, available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments. Our revolving line of credit is also available should additional working capital be required. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit or other sources of capital will be available to us in the future. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. On October 1, 2004, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of our $100 million revolving line of credit to October 1, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness as defined in the agreement. At September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either the defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.15% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005 no amounts were drawn under the agreement. The amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $88.4 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $11.6 million at September 25, 2005. On November 7, 2005, we amended our credit facility to delete negative covenants related to the repurchase of Company stock and payment of dividends. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $8.3 million and $12.9 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. The debentures have a conversion rate of 21.28 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, or approximately 311,000 shares and 505,000 shares at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. Approximately $5.0 million and $150.1 million of the carrying amount of the debentures was voluntarily converted by holders to approximately 194,000 and 6.0 million shares of Company common stock during fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company made the final principal payment of approximately $5.7 million to retire its senior notes on May 16, 2006. 28 Table of Contents Net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of stock options by team members totaled approximately $222.0 million, $85.8 million and $59.5 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The higher rate of stock option exercises in fiscal year 2006 resulted in part from the accelerated vesting of stock options on September 22, 2005. Net cash used by financing activities was approximately $189.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $25.2 million and $22.9 million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.

On November 2, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share payable on January 22, 2007 to shareholders of record on January 12, 2007. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. On November 8, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million. On November 6, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Companys stock repurchase program, bringing the total remaining authorization to $200 million over the next three years. The specific timing and repurchase amounts will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Companys available cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006. The average price per share paid was $49.85, for a total of approximately $100 million. At September 25, 2005, we had no shares of Company common stock in treasury. 29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for approximately 93.9% and 94.1% of inventories in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $13.2 million and $10.7 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. Costs for remaining inventories are determined by the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 54% of inventories in fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by counting each item in inventory, then applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately 46% of inventories in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Income Taxes We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the 30 Table of Contents enactment date. Significant accounting judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Share Based Compensation Our Company maintains several share based incentive plans. We grant options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are generally exercisable ratably over a four year period beginning one year from grant date and have a five year term. The grant date is established once the Companys Board of Directors approves the grant and all key terms have been determined. The exercise prices of our stock option grants are the closing price on the grant date. Stock option grant terms and conditions are communicated to team members within a relatively short period of time. Our Company generally approves one primary stock option grant annually, occurring during a trading window. Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Under this plan, participating team members may purchase our common stock each fiscal quarter through payroll deductions. Participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100 percent of market value or restricted shares at 85 percent of market value on the purchase date. Prior to the effective date of revised SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant. Effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, prior periods were not restated. The Company uses the Black Scholes multiple option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term team members will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. The related share based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding, but not yet vested, on the effective date. SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from equity based compensation expense will not exceed 10%. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 15, Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option. SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 123R 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of the Share Based Payment Awards (FSP FAS 123R 3). The Company has elected to adopt the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool (APIC pool) pool in paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R. The prescribed transition method is a detailed method to establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of share based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of share based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 31 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 (SAB No. 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of SAB No. 108 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measures. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards, except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value and does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the specified fair value measures for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with Statement 109 and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on managements best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an enterprises fiscal year, provided the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period, for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (that is, Gross versus Net Presentation). Taxes within the scope of EITF Issue No. 06 3 include any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but are not limited to, sales taxes, use taxes, value added taxes, and some excise taxes. The EITF concluded that the presentation of these taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed. For any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements. The Companys policy is to exclude all such taxes from revenue. The provisions of EITF 06 3 are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of EITF 06 3 will not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long lived, non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. The provisions of SFAS No. 154 are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement was issued. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 154, as applicable, beginning in fiscal year 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements. 32 Table of Contents Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material. Interest Rate Risk We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt. The Company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. These investments are of a short term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income. We classify our investments as available for sale and, accordingly, have recorded them at fair value on our balance sheets. We had investments totaling approximately $203.9 million and $325.7 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively, which earned an average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and 3.5%, respectively. At September 24, 2006, an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million related to investments was included as a component of shareholders equity. During fiscal year 2006, we made the final principal payment of approximately $5.7 million to retire our senior notes. Our senior unsecured notes had fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes bore interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $5.7 million at September 25, 2005. At September 25, 2005, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $0.1 million. Interest Rate and Market Risk Our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. During fiscal year 2006 and 2005 approximately $5.0 million and $150.1 million, respectively, of the carrying amount, of the debentures were converted, at the option of the holder, into Company common stock. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $8.3 million and $12.9 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. At September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $11.0 million and $21.8 million, respectively. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. 33 Table of Contents
