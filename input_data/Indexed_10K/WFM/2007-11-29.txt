Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  General Whole Foods Market is the worlds leading natural and organic foods supermarket and Americas first national "Certified Organic" grocer. Our Company mission is to promote the vitality and well being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the health of our bodies are directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, food safety concerns, and the sustainability of our entire ecosystem. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last 27 years. Whole Foods Market, Inc. is a Texas corporation incorporated in 1980. The Company is based in Austin, Texas and conducts business through various wholly owned subsidiaries. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and completed our initial public offering in January 1992. As of September 30, 2007, we operated 276 stores organized into 11 geographic operating regions, each with its own leadership team: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. This includes 74 stores (net of divested locations) acquired from Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats") on August 28, 2007: 70 stores in 22 U.S. states and four stores in Canada. Effective August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats"), a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in a cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. Wild Oats results of operations are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period beginning August 28, 2007 through September 30, 2007. At the date of acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace nationwide, Henrys Farmers Market ("Henrys") in Southern California, Sun Harvest in Texas, and Capers Community Market ("Capers") in British Columbia. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to all 35 Henrys and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles based food retailer. The Company received proceeds totaling approximately $165 million for the net assets of those stores, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventories and operating leases. This sale was completed effective September 30, 2007. Of the remaining 74 Wild Oats and Capers banner stores the Company acquired in the Wild Oats Markets transaction, the Company has closed nine stores, including one that will re open after an extended renovation period, and relocated two stores to date, and currently intends to close an additional store, re open the renovated location, and relocate an additional seven stores to existing Whole Foods Market sites in development. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal year 2007 was a 53 week year and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52 week years. 34  Fiscal Year 2007 Executive Summary Effective August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats, a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America with 109 stores in 23 states and British Columbia at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to all 35 Henrys and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles based food retailer. All of our 11 operating regions gained stores, with our three smallest regions, the Florida, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions, gaining critical mass. The acquisition provided us with immediate entry into five new states: Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, and 15 new markets: Bend, OR; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Lexington, KY; Little Rock, AR; Melbourne, FL; Memphis, TN; Naples, FL; Nashville, TN; Reno, NV; Salt Lake City, UT; Tampa, FL; Tucson, AZ; Tulsa, OK; and Westport, CT. Fiscal year 2007 was a 53 week year and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52 week years. Sales for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $6.6 billion, an increase of approximately 17.6% over the prior year, driven by 14% ending square footage growth (excluding acquired Wild Oats locations) and comparable store sales growth of 7.1%. Adjusted to reflect a fifty two week period in fiscal year 2007, sales increased 15.3% over the prior fiscal year. Net income for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $182.7 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.29. Our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $529.7 million, of which approximately $389.3 million was for new store development. We opened 21 new stores during fiscal year 2007, and we ended the fiscal year with 276 stores. At the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company had total debt of approximately $760.9 million, including a $700 million term loan used to finance the Wild Oats acquisition, approximately $21.8 million in Wild Oats and $2.7 million in Whole Foods Market convertible debentures, approximately $19.4 million in capital lease obligations and approximately $17 million in borrowings on the Companys revolving line of credit. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company paid off the Wild Oats convertible debentures and the credit line balance. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company received approximately $165.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the Henrys and Sun Harvest stores. The Company paid quarterly cash dividends totaling approximately $96.7 million during fiscal year 2007. On September 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share that was paid on October 23, 2007 to shareholders of record on October 12, 2007. On November 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. During fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Company common stock on the open market for a total of approximately $100 million. The Companys remaining authorization under the stock repurchase program at September 30, 2007 is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009. 35  Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2007 2006 2005 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.2 65.1 64.9 Gross profit 34.8 34.9 35.1 Direct store expenses 26.0 25.4 26.0 General and administrative expenses 3.3 3.2 3.4 Pre opening and relocation costs 1.1 0.7 0.8 Operating income 4.5 5.7 4.9 Interest expense (0.1 ) Investment and other income 0.2 0.4 0.2 Income before income taxes 4.6 6.1 5.0 Provision for income taxes 1.8 2.4 2.1 Net income 2.8 % 3.6 % 2.9 % Figures may not add due to rounding. Sales Sales totaled approximately $6.59 billion, $5.61 billion and $4.70 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing increases of 17.6%, 19.3% and 21.6% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Adjusted to reflect a fifty two week period in fiscal year 2007, sales increased 15.3% over the prior fiscal year. Sales for fiscal year 2007 reflect five weeks of sales from Wild Oats stores. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 7.1%, 11.0% and 12.8% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales increased approximately 5.8%, 10.3% and 11.5% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base in the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. Ending square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was approximately 46%, 10% and 13% for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, average transactions per week increased approximately 4.3%, 5.6% and 6.9% over the prior fiscal year, respectively, and average basket size increased approximately 2.6%, 5.0% and 5.5% over the prior fiscal year, respectively. The Company believes the integration of the acquired Wild Oats stores into our operations and new store openings will drive strong sales growth and comparable store sales growth in future periods. For fiscal year 2008, on a 52 week to 52 week basis, the Company expects sales growth of 25% to 30%, of which approximately 10% is expected to come from the Wild Oats stores, and comparable store sales growth of 7.5% to 9.5% 36 Gross Profit Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations. Gross profit totaled approximately $2.30 billion, $1.96 billion and $1.65 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 34.8%, 34.9% and 35.1% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. We have many buying initiatives in place that are benefiting our customers. Our strategy is to be competitively priced on a market by market basis on commodity type products and on identical product brands in grocery and Whole Body; however, our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality, broader selection, and better customer service available in our produce, meat, seafood, bakery, specialty and prepared foods departments. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $1.71 billion, $1.42 billion and $1.22 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 26.0%, 25.4% and 26.0% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Direct store expenses in fiscal year 2005 include natural disaster costs totaling approximately $13.4 million. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. The Company does not expect to leverage direct store expenses in fiscal year 2008 due primarily to anticipated investments in labor and benefits at the acquired stores and continued, though more moderate, increases in health care costs as a percentage of sales. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $217.7 million, $181.2 million and $158.9 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.3%, 3.2% and 3.4% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. General and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2007 include approximately $13 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in costs incurred during the fourth quarter related to legal matters, Wild Oats integration efforts and the addition of Wild Oats expenses. The Company currently expects general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2008 to be in line with the 3.3% reported in fiscal year 2007, due primarily to the temporary costs associated with integrating the Wild Oats acquisition along with the cost of fully staffing the Companys three smallest regions which gained the greatest number of stores, as a percentage of our existing store base, in the merger. 37 Pre opening and Relocation Costs Pre opening costs include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and other costs related to new store openings, including costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred approximately nine months prior to a stores opening date. Other pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Pre opening and relocation costs totaled approximately $70.2 million, $37.4 million and $37.0 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pre opening and relocation costs as a percentage of sales were 1.1%, 0.7% and 0.8% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stores newly opened and relocated were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 New stores 16 11 12 Relocated stores 5 2 3 Total stores opened 21 13 15 Interest Expense Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $4.2 million, $32,000 and $2.2 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal year 2007 over the prior fiscal year includes interest expense on the $700 million term loan we entered into on August 28, 2007 to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The reduction in net interest expense in fiscal year 2006 from the prior fiscal year includes the decrease in interest expense on convertible debentures due to the voluntary conversion by holders of approximately $150.1 million of the carrying amount of the debentures to approximately 6.0 million shares of Company common stock during fiscal year 2005. The Company had approximately $17 million outstanding on its revolving line of credit at September 30, 2007 and no amounts outstanding at the end of fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Company made the final principal payment of approximately $5.7 million to retire its senior notes on May 16, 2006. The Company expects interest expense, net of investment and other income, to range from approximately $35 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2008. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $11.3 million, $20.7 million and $9.6 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in investment and other income in fiscal year 2007 from the prior fiscal year primarily resulted from lower average investment balances. The increase in investment and other income in fiscal year 2006 over the prior fiscal year primarily resulted from higher yields on investments and higher average investment balances. Investment and other income for fiscal year 2006 includes approximately $2.1 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina losses. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate on income was approximately 40.0% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and approximately 42.5% in fiscal year 2005. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily from the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options during the fourth quarter. 38 Share Based Payments The Company recognized share based payments expense totaling approximately $19.9 million in fiscal year 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company recognized an estimated share based payments expense totaling approximately $17.4 million in fiscal year 2005 related to this acceleration. The Company also recognized share based payments expense in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $2.5 million for modification of terms of certain stock option grants and other compensation based on the intrinsic value of the Companys common stock. The Companys effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 was higher than its historical rate primarily due to the non deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," which requires all companies to recognize an expense for share based payments, including stock options, based on the fair value of the equity instrument. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted a final rule amending Rule 4 01(a) of Regulation S X amending the compliance date for SFAS No. 123R to be effective starting with the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R were effective for the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Company recognized share based payments expense before income taxes under the requirements of SFAS No. 123R totaling approximately $13.2 million and $9.4 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the fiscal year 2007 and 2006 total expense is approximately $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for modification of terms of certain stock option grants and approximately $4.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to increase the estimated charge related to the 2005 acceleration based on actual experience. Share based payments expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs $ 475 $ 264 $ 1,192 Direct store expenses 7,093 3,555 10,092 General and administrative expenses 5,607 5,613 8,612 Share based payments expense before income taxes 13,175 9,432 19,896 Income tax benefit (4,114 ) (2,724 ) (4,454 ) Net share based payments expense $ 9,061 $ 6,708 $ 15,442 The Company expects share based payments expense before income taxes of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million per quarter in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008 and approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million per quarter in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year following the Companys annual grant date early in the third quarter, when the majority of options are granted. 39 Natural Disaster Costs The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and accordingly the Company recorded expenses in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. The main components of the $16.5 million expense were estimated impaired assets totaling approximately $12.2 million, estimated inventory losses totaling approximately $2.5 million, salaries and relocation allowances for displaced Team Members and other costs totaling approximately $3.4 million, and a $1.0 million special donation from the Company to the American Red Cross, net of accrued estimated insurance proceeds totaling approximately $2.6 million. In fiscal year 2005, approximately $13.4 million of net natural disaster costs is included in "Direct store expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, approximately $1.0 million is included in "General and administrative expenses," and approximately $2.1 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs." In fiscal year 2006, the Company recognized approximately $7.2 million in pre tax credits for insurance proceeds and other adjustments related to previously estimated Hurricane Katrina losses, of which approximately $4.2 million is included in "Direct store expenses," approximately $0.9 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs," and approximately $2.1 million is included in "Investment and other income."  Liquidity and Capital Resources We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $398.6 million, $452.7 million and $410.8 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income less non cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of fiscal year 2006, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00 15, "Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow. The Companys excess tax benefit received upon exercise of nonqualified team member stock options totaled approximately $12.8 million and $52.0 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $895.0 million, $569.3 million and $322.2 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For fiscal year 2007, net cash used in investing activities includes approximately $596.2 million paid for the purchase of Wild Oats. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled approximately $529.7 million, $340.2 million and $324.1 million, respectively, of which approximately $389.3 million, $208.6 million and $207.8 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $140.3 million, $131.6 million and $116.3 million, respectively, was for remodels and other additions. The increase in capital expenditures on new stores in fiscal year 2007 was due to the Companys accelerated rate of new store opening in the year. The Company expects a comparable number of new store openings in fiscal year 2008 as in fiscal year 2007. For fiscal year 2008, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $575 million to $625 million, of which approximately 65% to 70% is related to new stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008 and beyond and approximately 7% to 8% relates to remodels of acquired stores. 40  The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Stores Opened During Fiscal Year 2006 Stores Opened During Fiscal Year 2007 Properties Tendered as of November 20, 2007 Total Leases Signed as of November 20, 2007 Number of stores (including relocations) 13 21 20 87 Number of relocations 2 5 4 22 Number of lease acquisitions, ground leases and owned properties 1 4 9 13 New markets 4 3 1 14 Average store size (gross square feet) 50,200 56,500 45,800 51,200 As a percentage of existing store average size 147 % 167 % 133 % 148 % Total square footage 653,000 1,185,800 915,900 4,485,200 As a percentage of existing square footage 10 % 13 % 10 % 48 % Average pre opening expense per store $ 2.0 million $ 2.6 million Average pre opening rent per store $ 0.7 million $ 0.9 million Average tender period, in months 7.8 8.8 Average pre opening expense per store and average pre opening rent per store during fiscal year 2007 in the table above exclude the Kensington store opened in London during fiscal year 2007. The Company expects total pre opening and relocation costs for fiscal year 2008 to range from approximately $80 million to $90 million. Approximately $40 million to $45 million of this total relates to stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008. These ranges are based on estimated tender dates which are subject to change. The Company expects average pre opening and relocation expense for stores opening in fiscal year 2008 to be consistent with the average for stores that opened in fiscal year 2007, excluding the Kensington store in London. On an average weekly basis, the Company expects quarterly pre opening and relocation expense to ramp up throughout each quarter of the year. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $494.1 million and $25.2 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities was approximately $189.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $54.4 million, $222.0 million and $85.8 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher rate of stock option exercises in fiscal year 2006 resulted in part from the accelerated vesting of stock options on September 22, 2005. 41 On August 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock of our subsidiaries, bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% as of September 30, 2007, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on one month LIBOR was 6.13%. The term loan agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $490 million to fix the interest rate at 5.718%, inclusive of the applicable margin and associated fees, to help manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. On August 28, 2007, we also replaced our previous revolving credit facility with a new $250 million revolving line of credit that extends to 2012. The credit agreement contains an accordion feature under which the Company can increase the revolving credit facility to $350 million. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% at September 30, 2007, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on the alternative base rate was 7.75%. Commitment fees of 0.2% at September 30, 2007 of the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. At September 30, 2007, we had $17 million drawn under this agreement, which was paid off subsequent to year end. No amounts were drawn under the previous agreement at September 24, 2006. The amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $145.1 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $87.9 million and current borrowings at September 30, 2007. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $24.5 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. The Company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately $115.0 million in the Wild Oats acquisition, of which approximately $94.2 million was paid off during fiscal year 2007 and approximately $21.8 million, which included a related conversion premium totaling approximately $0.9 million, was paid off subsequent to year end. The remaining Whole Foods Market debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and a scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. The debentures have a conversion rate of 21.28 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, or approximately 97,000 shares and 311,000 shares at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Approximately $5.8 million and $5.0 million of the carrying amount of the debentures were voluntarily converted by holders to approximately 215,000 and 194,000 shares of Company common stock during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. 42 The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of certain equipment, buildings and land. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates through 2028. Capital leases totaling approximately $19.1 million were assumed with the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The Company expects interest expense, net of investment income, to range from approximately $35 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2008. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 30, 2007 (in thousands): Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Total Long term debt obligations $ 741,484 $ 24,484 $ $ 717,000 $ Capital lease obligations (including interest) 36,466 1,787 4,068 4,094 26,517 Operating lease obligations 6,029,447 212,711 573,317 620,475 4,622,944 The table above includes approximately $21.8 million of convertible senior debentures assumed in the Wild Oats acquisition which were paid off subsequent to year end. Although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain, the above table reflects the assumption that the remaining Whole Foods Market convertible debentures, shown at accreted value as of September 30, 2007, will be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008. We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Following is a summary of dividends declared in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Dividend per Share Date of Record Date of Payment Total Amount Date of Declaration Fiscal year 2007: September 27, 2006 $ 0.15 October 13, 2006 October 23, 2006 $ 20,971 November 2, 2006 0.18 January 12, 2007 January 22, 2007 25,303 March 5, 2007 0.18 April 13, 2007 April 24, 2007 25,448 June 5, 2007 0.18 July 13, 2007 July 24, 2007 25,019 September 20, 2007 0.18 October 12, 2007 October 23, 2007 25,060 (1) Fiscal year 2006: November 9, 2005 $ 0.15 January 13, 2006 January 23, 2006 $ 20,918 November 9, 2005 2.00 January 13, 2006 January 23, 2006 277,904 March 6, 2006 0.15 April 14, 2006 April 24, 2006 21,004 June 13, 2006 0.15 July 14, 2006 July 24, 2006 21,186 (1)Dividend accrued at September 30, 2007 On November 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. 43 On November 8, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million over four years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006 for a total of approximately $100 million. On November 6, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Companys stock repurchase program, bringing the total remaining authorization to $200 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million additional shares of Company common stock on the open market for a total of approximately $100 million. The average price per share paid for shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007 was $43.98, for a total of approximately $200 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company retired all shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007. The Companys remaining authorization under the stock repurchase program at September 30, 2007 is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009. The specific timing and repurchase of future amounts will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Companys available resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Our principal historical sources of liquidity have been cash generated by operations, available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and amounts available under our revolving line of credit. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit or other sources of capital will be available to us in the future. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Companys needs and market conditions. Absent any significant cash acquisition or significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by these sources.  Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Insurance and Self Insurance Liabilities The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 44 Reserves for Closed Properties The Company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores, distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations. The Company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated subtenant income. The closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms, which generally range from one to 17 years. The Company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the Companys experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, the Companys previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions. Capital lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value. Reduction in the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value. The Company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and, when necessary, utilizes local real estate brokers. Adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known. Inventory Valuation We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last in, first out ("LIFO") method for approximately 81.7% and 93.9% of inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $20.0 million and $13.2 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Costs for remaining inventories are determined by the first in, first out ("FIFO") method. Cost was determined using the retail method and the item cost method for inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by counting each item in inventory, then applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The item cost method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item cost method of accounting enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. 45 Income Taxes We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant accounting judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. Share Based Payments The Company maintains several share based incentive plans. We historically granted options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended. At our annual shareholders meeting, on March 5, 2007, our shareholders approved a new plan, the Whole Foods Market 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Options are granted pursuant to this new plan. Under both plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are generally exercisable ratably over a four year period beginning one year from grant date and have a five year term. The grant date is established once the Companys Board of Directors approves the grant and all key terms have been determined. The exercise prices of our stock option grants are the closing price on the grant date. Stock option grant terms and conditions are communicated to team members within a relatively short period of time. Our Company generally approves one primary stock option grant annually, occurring during a trading window. Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Participating team members may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions. At our annual meeting, shareholders approved a new Team Member Stock Purchase Plan ("TMSPP") which became effective on April 1, 2007. The TMSPP replaces all previous stock purchase plans and provides for a 5% discount on the shares purchase date market value which meets the "Safe Harbor" provisions of SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment" and therefore is non compensatory. Under the previous plans, participating team members could elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100% of market value or restricted shares at 85% of market value on the purchase date. Prior to the effective date of revised SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant. 46 Effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method, prior periods were not restated. The Company uses the Black Scholes multiple option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term team members will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. The related share based payments expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share based payments and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding, but not yet vested, on the effective date. SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share based payments expense will not exceed 10%. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00 15, "Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 123R 3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of the Share Based Payment Awards" ("FSP FAS 123R 3"). The Company has elected to adopt the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool ("APIC pool") in paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R. The prescribed transition method is a detailed method to establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of share based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of share based payment awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 47  Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with Statement 109 and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on managements best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an enterprises fiscal year, provided the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period, for that fiscal year. FIN 48 becomes effective for the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48, the Company does not expect the cumulative impact of the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 ("SAB No. 108"), "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. SAB 108 was effective for the Companys fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 and had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards, except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value and does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the specified fair value measures for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Companys fiscal year ending September 27, 2009, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 applies to all entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Companys fiscal year ending September 27, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 48  In May 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 48 1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48." The FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP No. FIN 48 1 should be applied upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FSP No. FIN 48 1 becomes effective for the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP No. FIN 48 1, the adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors." The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long term debt. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We are also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long term debt. Our line of credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings have revolving maturities. At September 30, 2007, approximately $17 million was outstanding under our line of credit agreement. At September 24, 2006, the Company held interest bearing instruments that were classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. These investments were of a short term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have had a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or interest income. We classified these investments as available for sale and, accordingly, recorded them at fair value on our balance sheet. At September 24, 2006, these investments totaled approximately $203.9 million and earned an average interest rate of approximately 3.8%. At September 24, 2006, an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million related to these investments was included as a component of shareholders equity. During fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, 1% as of September 30, 2007, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. Our term loans do not give rise to significant fair value risk because they are variable interest rate loans with revolving maturities which reflect market changes to interest rates. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $490 million to fix the interest rate at 5.718%, inclusive of the applicable margin and associated fees, to help manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 49 Interest Rate and Market Risk Our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. During fiscal year 2007 and 2006 approximately $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of the carrying amount, of the debentures were converted, at the option of the holder, into Company common stock. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $2.7 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. At September 30, 2007 the interest rate and market risk associated with the convertible debentures is not material. At September 24, 2006 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $11.0 million. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly. Market Risk We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We own and operate seven natural and organic foods supermarkets in Canada and six natural and organic foods supermarkets in the United Kingdom. Sales made from the Canadian and United Kingdom stores are made in exchange for Canadian dollars and Great Britain pounds, respectively. We do not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk. 50
