Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview General Whole Foods Market, Inc. is the leading natural and organic foods supermarket and Americas first national Certified Organic grocer. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a significant and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 27, 2009, we operated 284 stores: 273 stores in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; six stores in Canada; and five stores in the United Kingdom. We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. Stores typically open within 24 months after entering the store development pipeline. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation; although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation. The Company historically has experienced lower average weekly sales in the fourth quarter, which typically results in lower gross profit and higher direct store expenses as a percentage of sales. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Stores acquired in purchase acquisitions entered the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger. Identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with expansions of square footage greater than 20% from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. The Company reports its results of operations on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 52 week years and fiscal year 2007 was a 53 week year. Wild Oats Markets Acquisition Effective August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. (Wild Oats). At the date of acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace nationwide, Henrys Farmers Market (Henrys) in Southern California, Sun Harvest in Texas, and Capers Community Market in British Columbia. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventories and operating leases, related to all 35 Henrys and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center. As of September 27, 2009, the Company had 53 continuing Wild Oats stores, substantially all of which had been rebranded as Whole Foods Market stores. Results of operations for fiscal year 2007 include Wild Oats operating results for the period beginning August 28, 2007 through September 30, 2007. On June 1, 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved a settlement agreement resolving its antitrust challenge to the Companys acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, a third party divestiture trustee was appointed to market for sale until September 8, 2009: leases and related assets for 19 non operating former Wild Oats stores; leases and related fixed assets (excluding inventory) for 12 operating acquired Wild Oats stores and one operating Whole Foods Market store; and Wild Oats trademarks and other intellectual property associated with the Wild Oats stores. The divestiture period was extended by the FTC until March 8, 2010 for six operating and two non operating former Wild Oats stores as well as Wild Oats trademarks and other intellectual property associated with the Wild Oats stores. The divestiture period for those eight stores may be extended further only to allow the FTC to approve any previously submitted purchase agreements. The remaining seven operating stores and 17 non operating stores have been retained by the Company without further obligation to attempt to divest. Economic and Industry Factors Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies across the Company and includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, farmers markets, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. While growth has slowed from historical levels, natural and organic food is still one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Whole Foods Market experienced a challenging retail environment beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2008 and continuing in fiscal year 2009 caused primarily by the general economic environment in the United States and decreased consumer confidence. The Company experienced negative comparable and identical store sales for the fiscal year for the first 25 Table of Contents time in the Companys history. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, our comparable store and identical store sales trends improved for the second quarter in a row and, after five quarters of year over year declines, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 through November 4, 2009, comparable store and identical store sales were up 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Food cost inflation, which we began to experience at increasing levels in fiscal year 2008, began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, likely having a negative impact on our sales, basket size and price per item. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2010 The Company is pleased with its sales trends for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 through November 4, 2009; however, increased price investments could negatively impact our sales going forward, and with no anticipated positive change in the economy over the short term, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect sales results for the fiscal year in line with or slightly better than these quarter to date results. For the fiscal year, the Company expects sales growth of 5% to 8%, comparable store sales growth of 1% to 4%, and identical store sales growth of 0% to 3%. The Company expects to open 16 new stores, 10 of which are planned to open in the first half of the fiscal year. While sales comparisons are expected to improve in the first half of the year, the Company anticipates having greater difficulty leveraging expenses due to the cost savings realized in fiscal year 2009. The Company expects to produce cash flows from operations in excess of its capital expenditure requirements on an annual basis. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2009 2008 2007 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.7 66.0 65.2 Gross profit 34.3 34.0 34.8 Direct store expenses 26.7 26.5 26.0 General and administrative expenses 3.0 3.4 3.3 Pre opening expenses 0.6 0.7 0.9 Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs 0.4 0.5 0.2 Operating income 3.5 3.0 4.5 Interest expense (0.5 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Investment and other income 0.1 0.2 Income before income taxes 3.1 2.6 4.6 Provision for income taxes 1.3 1.2 1.8 Net income 1.8 1.4 2.8 Preferred stock dividends 0.3 Income available to common shareholders 1.5 % 1.4 % 2.8 % Figures may not sum due to rounding. Sales Sales totaled approximately $8.03 billion, $7.95 billion and $6.59 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, representing increases of 1.0%, 20.7% and 17.6% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Adjusted to reflect a 52 week period in fiscal year 2007, sales in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 increased 23.6% and 15.3% over the prior fiscal years, respectively. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired. Comparable store sales decreased approximately 3.1% in fiscal year 2009 and increased approximately 4.9% and 7.1% in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of September 27, 2009, there were 274 locations in the comparable store base. The number of stores open or acquired 52 weeks or less equaled 15, 20 and 102 at the end of fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The sales increase contributed by stores open or acquired within 52 weeks or less totaled approximately $234.8 million, $236.1 million, and $421.8 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Identical store sales decreased 4.3% in fiscal year 2009 and increased 3.6% and 5.8% in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Identical store sales in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 exclude from the comparable calculation twelve, seven and six store relocations, respectively, and three remodels with major expansions during portions of each year. Gross Profit Gross profit totaled approximately $2.75 billion, $2.71 billion and $2.30 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 34.3%, 34.0% and 34.8% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net LIFO inventory reserves were reduced by approximately $5.6 million in fiscal year 2009 due to net deflation in product costs compared to net reserve increases of approximately $12.7 million and $6.9 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. During fiscal year 2009, the Company realized lower cost of goods sold as a result of better purchasing and distribution disciplines as well as improved store level execution, particularly in terms of shrink control and inventory 26 Table of Contents management. Year over year, these improvements more than offset higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales. Occupancy costs include store rental costs, property taxes, utility costs, repair and maintenance, and property insurance. Additionally, we made strategic and targeted price investments by taking advantage of lower costs in certain areas, such as produce, to pass through great values to our customers. In other areas, for example in cheese and packaged nuts, we implemented new national programs to drive better values for customers without sacrificing gross margin. Factors contributing to the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year include the impact of Wild Oats, higher utility costs and property taxes as a percentage of sales and product cost increases greater than the Companys increases in average retail prices. To the extent changes in costs are not reflected in changes in retail prices or changes in retail prices are delayed, our gross profit will be affected. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including seasonality, competition, inflation or deflation. Relative to existing stores, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $2.15 billion, $2.11 billion and $1.71 billion in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 26.7%, 26.5% and 26.0% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Increased direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 reflect higher depreciation and health care costs as a percentage of sales. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $243.7 million, $270.4 million and $217.7 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.0%, 3.4% and 3.3% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to cost containment measures implemented at the Companys global and regional offices beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 include FTC related legal costs totaling approximately $14.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Pre opening Expenses Pre opening expenses include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and other costs related to new store openings, including costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred approximately thirteen months prior to a stores opening date. Other pre opening expenses are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. The Company opened 15, 20 and 21 new store locations during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pre opening expenses totaled approximately $49.2 million, $55.6 million and $59.3 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pre opening expenses as a percentage of sales were 0.6%, 0.7% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Relocation, Store Closure and Lease Termination Costs Relocation costs consist of moving costs, estimated remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs, related asset impairment, and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Store closure costs consist of estimated remaining net lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs, related asset impairment, and other costs associated with closed facilities. Lease termination costs consist of estimated remaining net lease payments for terminated leases and idle properties and associated asset impairments. The Company relocated or closed 6, 21 and 5 store locations during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs totaled approximately $31.2 million, $36.5 million and $10.9 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs as a percentage of sales were 0.4%, 0.5% and 0.2% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 include charges totaling approximately $9.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, to increase store closure reserves for increased estimated net lease obligations for closed stores and approximately $4.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, in costs related to lease modifications or terminations for stores previously in development. The Company also recorded a charge totaling approximately $4.8 million in fiscal year 2009 to adjust the carrying value of leases and fixed assets to fair value relating to the potential sale of certain operating locations as part of the FTC settlement agreement. Interest Expense Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $36.9 million, $36.4 million and $4.2 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net interest expense in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 includes interest expense on the $700 million term loan we entered into on August 28, 2007 to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The Company had no amounts outstanding and $195 million outstanding on its revolving line of credit at September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $3.4 million, $6.7 million and $11.3 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreases in investment and other income in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 primarily resulted from lower average short term return rates on investments and lower average investment balances in fiscal year 2008. Income Taxes Income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 41.5%, 44.5% and 40.0% in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 resulted primarily from the repatriation of cash from the Companys Canadian subsidiary. Share Based Payments Share based payment expense before income taxes recognized during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $12.8 million, $10.5 million and $13.2 million, respectively. Share based payment expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs $ 439 $ 233 $ 475 Direct store expenses 7,152 5,300 7,093 General and administrative expenses 5,204 4,972 5,607 Share based payment expense before income taxes 12,795 10,505 13,175 Income tax benefit (5,222 ) (4,815 ) (4,114 ) Net share based payment expense $ 7,573 $ 5,690 $ 9,061 The Company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share based payment expense will not exceed 10%. The Company believes this strategy is best aligned with its stakeholder philosophy because it limits future earnings per share dilution from options and at the same time retains the broad based stock option plan, which the Company believes is important to team member morale, its unique corporate culture and its success. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $430.1 million and $30.5 million and restricted cash totaling approximately $71.0 million and $0.6 million at September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. The increase in restricted cash at September 27, 2009 primarily relates to cash invested as collateral to support a portion of our projected workers compensation obligations that were previously collateralized by an outstanding letter of credit. We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $587.7 million, $335.0 million and $391.5 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income plus non cash expenses and changes in operating working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $386.3 million, $372.7 million and $890.4 million for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For fiscal year 2007, net cash used in investing activities includes approximately $596.2 million paid for the purchase of Wild Oats. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled approximately $314.6 million, $529.5 million and $524.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $248.0 million, $357.5 million and $388.8 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $66.6 million, $172.0 million and $135.8 million, respectively, was for remodels and other property, plant and equipment expenditures. For fiscal year 2010, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $350 million to $400 million. 28 Table of Contents The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Properties Total Stores Opened Stores Opened Tendered Leases Signed During Fiscal During Fiscal as of as of Year 2008 Year 2009 November 4, 2009 November 4, 2009(1) Number of stores (including relocations) 20 15 18 53 Number of relocations 6 6 1 8 Number of lease acquisitions, ground leases and owned properties 4 4 4 4 New areas 3 1 4 7 Average store size (gross square feet) 53,000 53,500 43,500 44,800 Total square footage 1,060,700 801,800 783,800 2,409,700 Average tender period in months 9.7 12.6 Average pre opening expense per store $ 2.5 million $ 3.0 million Average pre opening rent per store $ 1.1 million $ 1.3 million (1) Includes leased properties tendered The following table provides information about the Companys historical store growth: 2009 2008 2007 Stores at beginning of fiscal year 275 276 186 Stores opened 15 20 21 Acquired stores 109 Divested stores (35 ) Relocations and closures (6 ) (21 ) (5 ) Stores at end of fiscal year 284 275 276 Remodels with major expansions(1) 2 1 2 Total gross square footage at end of fiscal year 10,566,000 9,895,000 9,312,000 (1) Defined as remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% completed during the fiscal year. We are focused on the right sized store for each location and, since announcing in the third quarter of 2007 our intent to decrease the size of several leases in development, we have downsized 14 leases by an average of 12,000 square feet each. We also have terminated 16 leases for stores in development totaling approximately 846,000 square feet, or an average of 53,000 square feet per store. In addition, we are building out a smaller footprint (averaging 15,000 square feet each) at seven locations, two of which opened in fiscal year 2009. We currently operate 12 stores in excess of 65,000 gross square feet and have an additional five stores of that size in development, two of which are relocations. The Company has opened three stores and closed one store in fiscal year 2010 as of November 4, 2009. The following table provides additional information about the Companys estimated store openings for the remainder of fiscal years 2010 through 2013 based on the Companys current development pipeline. These openings reflect estimated tender dates which are subject to change and do not incorporate any potential new leases, terminations or square footage reductions: Average Ending New Store Ending Square Total Square Square Footage Openings Relocations Footage Footage(1) Growth Remaining fiscal year 2010 stores in development 13 44,600 11,216,100 6.2 % Fiscal year 2011 stores in development 17 4 39,600 11,772,300 5.0 % Fiscal year 2012 stores in development 15 2 46,900 12,426,600 5.6 % Fiscal year 2013 stores in development 8 2 53,200 12,781,200 2.9 % Total 53 8 44,800 (1) Reflects openings and closures in fiscal year 2010 through November 4, 2009 and one expansion in development in fiscal year 2011. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $199.5 million, $69.8 million and $494.1 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $4.3 million, $18.0 million and $54.4 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 29 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock in our subsidiaries, bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate (ABR) plus an applicable margin, currently 0.75%, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, currently 1.75%, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. These applicable margins are currently the maximum allowed under these agreements. The interest period on LIBOR borrowings may range from one to six months at our option. The Company recorded approximately $3.4 million in debt origination fees for the term loan which are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the loan. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, as a result of downgrades to our corporate credit ratings and as called for in the loan agreement, the participating banks obtained security interests in certain of the Companys assets to collateralize amounts outstanding under the term loan. The term loan agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. No further material restrictive covenants or limitations on additional indebtedness and payments have been imposed as a result of the downgrades to our corporate credit ratings. At September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. The Company also has outstanding a $350 million revolving line of credit, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock in our subsidiaries, that extends to 2012. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the ABR plus an applicable margin, currently 0.875%, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, currently 1.875%, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. These applicable margins are currently the maximum allowed under these agreements. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, as a result of downgrades to our corporate credit ratings and as called for in the loan agreement, the participating banks obtained security interests in certain of the Companys assets to collateralize amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. No further material restrictive covenants or limitations on additional indebtedness and payments have been imposed as a result of the downgrades to our corporate credit ratings. Commitment fees on the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. At September 28, 2008 the Company had $195 million drawn under this agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding and no amounts were drawn under this agreement at September 27, 2009. The amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $335.2 million and $75.9 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $14.8 million and $79.1 million at September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. Interest paid during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled approximately $43.7 million, $36.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The increase in interest paid in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 is due to interest costs associated with the $700 million term loan. Interest paid in fiscal year 2007 includes interest costs associated with the $700 million term loan agreement for the period from August 28, 2007 through September 30, 2007. The Company expects interest expense, net of investment and other income, to range from approximately $35 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2010. The Company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately $115.0 million in the Wild Oats acquisition, of which approximately $94.2 million was paid off during fiscal year 2007 and approximately $21.8 million, which included a related conversion premium totaling approximately $0.9 million, was paid off during fiscal year 2008. Approximately 250 Whole Foods Market zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures were converted at the option of the holders to approximately 6,000 shares of Company common stock during fiscal year 2008. We had outstanding convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $2.7 million at September 28, 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the Company redeemed all remaining debentures at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount totaling approximately $2.7 million. On December 2, 2008, the Company issued 425,000 shares of Series A 8% Redeemable, Convertible Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (Series A Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., for approximately $413.1 million, net of approximately $11.9 million in closing and issuance costs. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2009, on October 23, 2009 the Company announced its intention to call all 425,000 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for redemption in accordance with the terms governing such Series A Preferred Stock. Subject to conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock by its holders, the Company planned to redeem such Series A Preferred Stock on November 27, 2009 at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In accordance with the terms governing the Series A Preferred Stock, at any time prior to the redemption date, the Series A Preferred Stock could be converted by the holders thereof. On November 26, 2009 the holders converted all 425,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock of the Company. During fiscal year 2009, the Company paid cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock totaling approximately $19.8 million. 30 Table of Contents The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment, buildings, and land and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates from 2010 to 2054. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 27, 2009 (in thousands): Less than 1 1 3 3 5 More than 5 Total Year Years Years Years Long term debt obligations $ 700,000 $ $ 700,000 $ $ Estimated interest on long term debt obligations 64,491 35,904 28,587 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 39,040 2,066 4,153 4,182 28,639 Operating lease obligations(1) 5,650,318 265,408 591,489 619,125 4,174,296 Total $ 6,453,849 $ 303,378 $ 1,324,229 $ 623,307 $ 4,202,935 (1)Amounts exclude taxes, insurance and other related expenses. At September 27, 2009, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $18.1 million including interest and penalties. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by $0.5 million in the next 12 months. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities cannot be determined due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities. We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business.
