Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Whole Foods Market, Inc. is the leading natural and organic foods supermarket and Americas first national Certified Organic grocer. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a significant and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 26, 2010, we operated 299 stores: 288 stores in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; six stores in Canada; and five stores in the United Kingdom. We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. Stores typically open within 24 months after entering the store development pipeline. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation. Gross profit is typically lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales, and in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonally slower sales period during the summer months. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Stores acquired in purchase acquisitions enter the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger. Identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with expansions of square footage greater than 20% from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. The Company reports its results of operations on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 52 week years. Economic and Industry Factors Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies across the Company and includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, farmers markets, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of store ambiance and experience, product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. Natural and organic food continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Highlights for Fiscal Year 2010 Whole Foods Market experienced strong sales and earnings growth in fiscal year 2010 against increasingly tougher sales comparisons in the later quarters of the year. We are gaining market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute much of our success to the progress we have made in our relative price positioning and to our initiatives in areas such as healthy eating, animal welfare and sustainable seafood. These initiatives are aligned with our core customer base and reinforce our position as the authentic retailer of natural and organic foods, further differentiating the Whole Foods Market shopping experience and making us the preferred choice for customers aspiring to a healthier lifestyle. In fiscal year 2010: Sales increased 12.1% over the prior year to $9.01 billion driven by a 7.1% comparable store sales increase. Identical store sales increased 6.5% over the prior year; Income available to common shareholders increased 102% over the prior year to $240.4 million; Diluted earnings per share increased 69% over the prior year to $1.43; We produced $585.3 million in cash flow from operations and invested $256.8 million in capital expenditures. We had cash, restricted cash, and investments totaling approximately $644.7 million at the end of the fiscal year; and We repaid $210 million of our term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $490 million at the end of the fiscal year, and had $342.9 million available on our credit line. Additionally, our Board of Directors promoted Walter Robb to co chief executive officer and elected him to the Board of Directors, and promoted A.C. Gallo as the Companys sole president and chief operating officer. John Mackey, co founder of the Company, continues to serve as co chief executive officer and as a member of the Board of Directors alongside Mr. Robb. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2011 The Company expects sales growth of 10% to 12% for fiscal year 2011 driven by weighted average square footage growth of approximately 5% and identical stores sales growth of 5% to 7%. We are hopeful we can continue to successfully strike the right balance between driving sales, improving our value offerings and maintaining margin going forward. The Company 18 Table of Contents expects interest expense, net of investment and other income, to range from approximately $1 million to $3 million in fiscal year 2011. We expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2011 to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.71, or 16% to 20% growth year over year. This guidance reflects steady sales growth on tougher comparisons as well as our commitment to delivering incremental earnings growth in excess of sales growth. The Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2011 to be in the range of approximately $350 million to $400 million. The Company expects to produce cash flows from operations in excess of its capital expenditure requirements on an annual basis. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2010 2009 2008 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.2 65.7 66.0 Gross profit 34.8 34.3 34.0 Direct store expenses 26.4 26.7 26.5 General and administrative expenses 3.0 3.0 3.4 Pre opening expenses 0.4 0.6 0.7 Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs 0.1 0.4 0.5 Operating income 4.9 3.5 3.0 Interest expense (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.5 ) Investment and other income 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 4.6 3.1 2.6 Provision for income taxes 1.8 1.3 1.2 Net income 2.7 1.8 1.4 Preferred stock dividends 0.1 0.3 Income available to common shareholders 2.7 % 1.5 % 1.4 % Figures may not sum due to rounding. Sales Sales totaled approximately $9.01 billion, $8.03 billion and $7.95 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing increases of 12.1%, 1.0% and 20.7% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to identical store sales growth and new stores opened or acquired. We also have worked hard to improve our value image and believe our success in this regard has played a large role in the sales momentum we are seeing. Customers are still seeking value as demonstrated by continued strong sales growth in promotional and store branded items; however, national branded product sales growth is outpacing store branded sales growth, and customers are selectively trading up to higher priced items in certain areas. Comparable store sales increased approximately 7.1% and 4.9% in fiscal years 2010 and 2008, respectively, and decreased approximately 3.1% in fiscal year 2009. As of September 26, 2010, there were 281 locations in the comparable store base. The number of stores open or acquired 52 weeks or less equaled 18, 15 and 20 at the end of fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The sales increase contributed by stores open or acquired within 52 weeks or less totaled approximately $251.8 million, $234.8 million and $236.1 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Identical store sales increased approximately 6.5% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2010 and 2008, respectively, and decreased approximately 4.3% in fiscal year 2009. Identical store sales in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 exclude from the comparable calculation six, twelve and seven store relocations, respectively, and two, three and three remodels with major expansions, respectively, during portions of each fiscal year. Gross Profit Gross profit totaled approximately $3.14 billion, $2.75 billion and $2.71 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net LIFO inventory reserves were reduced by approximately $7.7 million and $5.6 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to reduced inventory balances and net deflation in product costs compared to an increase in net reserves of approximately $12.7 million in fiscal year 2008. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the Company realized sequentially lower cost of goods sold by taking advantage of buying opportunities and improving our distribution, shrink control and inventory management. We have maintained our commitment to offering highly competitive prices on known value items in addition to implementing targeted pricing and promotional strategies. To the extent changes in costs are not reflected in changes in retail prices or changes in retail prices are delayed, our gross profit will be affected. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including seasonality, competition, inflation or deflation. Relative to existing stores, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. 19 Table of Contents Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $2.38 billion, $2.15 billion and $2.11 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Decreased direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2010 reflect leverage in depreciation, asset impairment charges, and health care costs, partially offset by an increase in workers compensation expense, as a percentage of sales. Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $272.4 million, $243.7 million and $270.4 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales starting in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to cost containment measures implemented at the Companys global and regional offices beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. General and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2010 include share based payment costs related to restricted common stock grants of approximately $4.2 million. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 include FTC related legal costs totaling approximately $2.5 million, $14.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Pre opening Expenses Pre opening expenses totaled approximately $38.0 million, $49.2 million and $55.6 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company opened 16, 15 and 20 new store locations during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Average pre opening expense per new store, including pre opening rent, totaled approximately $2.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.5 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Relocation, Store Closure and Lease Termination Costs Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs totaled approximately $11.2 million, $31.2 million and $36.5 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company relocated or closed 1, 6 and 21 store locations during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Fiscal year 2008 store closures primarily relate to the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 include charges totaling approximately $6.9 million, $9.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, to increase store closure reserves for increased estimated net lease obligations for closed stores and approximately $1.0 million, $4.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, in costs related to lease modifications or terminations for stores previously in development. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a gain totaling approximately $3.2 million related to the sale of a non operating property. The Company recorded a charge totaling approximately $4.8 million in fiscal year 2009 to adjust the carrying value of leases and fixed assets to fair value relating to the potential sale of certain operating locations as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement agreement. Interest Expense Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $33.0 million, $36.9 million and $36.4 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest expense for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 consists principally of interest expense on the term loan we entered into on August 28, 2007 to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The reduction in net interest expense in fiscal year 2010 is primarily due to the repayment during the third quarter of the $210 million portion of the term loan that was not subject to an interest rate swap agreement. The Company had no amounts outstanding on its revolving line of credit at September 26, 2010 or September 27, 2009. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $6.9 million, $3.4 million and $6.7 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company held higher average investment balances during fiscal year 2010. Income Taxes Income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 40.3%, 41.5% and 44.5% in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for fiscal year 2008 resulted primarily from the repatriation of cash from the Companys Canadian subsidiary. 20 Table of Contents Share Based Payments Share based payment expense before income taxes recognized during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $22.9 million, $12.8 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Share based payment expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs $ 862 $ 439 $ 233 Direct store expenses 10,140 7,152 5,300 General and administrative expenses 11,892 5,204 4,972 Share based payment expense before income taxes 22,894 12,795 10,505 Income tax benefit (9,170 ) (5,222 ) (4,815 ) Net share based payment expense $ 13,724 $ 7,573 $ 5,690 The Company intends to keep its stock incentive program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share based payment expense will not exceed 10%. The Company believes this strategy is best aligned with its stakeholder philosophy because it limits future earnings per share dilution from options and at the same time retains the broad based stock option plan, which the Company believes is important to team member morale, its unique corporate culture and its success. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the Companys cash and short term investments for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands): 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 131,996 $ 430,130 Short term investments available for sale securities 329,738 Restricted cash 86,802 71,023 Total $ 548,536 $ 501,153 We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $585.3 million, $587.7 million and $335.0 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income plus non cash expenses and changes in operating working capital. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $715.4 million, $386.3 million and $372.7 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately $425.6 million of the net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2010 resulted from our investment of a portion of our available cash balances in available for sale securities. At September 26, 2010, we had short term investments in available for sale securities totaling approximately $329.7 million and long term investments in available for sale securities totaling approximately $96.1 million. During fiscal year 2008, net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by approximately $163.9 million received from the sale of 35 operating locations under the Henrys Farmers Market and Sun Harvest banners. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled approximately $256.8 million, $314.6 million and $529.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $171.4 million, $248.0 million and $357.5 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $85.4 million, $66.6 million and $172.0 million, respectively, was for remodels and other property and equipment expenditures. 21 Table of Contents The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Properties Total Stores opened Stores opened tendered leases signed during fiscal during fiscal as of as of year 2009 year 2010 November 3, 2010 November 3, 2010(1) Number of stores (including relocations) 15 16 11 52 Number of relocations 6 3 9 Number of lease acquisitions, ground leases and owned properties 4 4 4 New areas 1 4 1 8 Average store size (gross square feet) 53,500 42,600 41,100 38,700 Total square footage 801,800 682,200 451,900 2,051,800 Average tender period in months 12.6 10.9 Average pre opening expense per store $ 3.0 million $ 2.6 million Average pre opening rent per store $ 1.3 million $ 1.2 million (1) Includes leased properties tendered The following table provides information about the Companys historical store growth: 2010 2009 2008 Stores at beginning of fiscal year 284 275 276 Stores opened 16 15 20 Acquired stores 2 Divested stores (2 ) Relocated stores (5 ) (7 ) Closed stores (1 ) (1 ) (14 ) Stores at end of fiscal year 299 284 275 Remodels with major expansions(1) 2 1 Total gross square footage at end of fiscal year 11,231,000 10,566,000 9,895,000 Year over year growth 6 % 7 % 6 % (1) Defined as remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% completed during the fiscal year.

Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $168.9 million in fiscal year 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $199.5 million and $69.8 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $47.0 million, $4.3 million and $18.0 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company repaid the $210 million portion of the term loan that was not subject to an interest rate swap agreement. At September 26, 2010, the Company had outstanding $490 million under this agreement. Subsequent to year end, the Company repaid an additional $100 million on the term loan, bringing the current outstanding to $390 million. The loan, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock in our subsidiaries, bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate (ABR) plus an applicable margin, currently 0.5%, or 22 Table of Contents LIBOR plus an applicable margin, currently 1.5%, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. The interest period on LIBOR borrowings may range from one to six months at our option. The participating banks obtained security interests in certain of the Companys assets to collateralize amounts outstanding under the term loan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The term loan agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 26, 2010, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. The Company also has outstanding a $350 million revolving line of credit, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock in our subsidiaries, that extends to 2012. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 26, 2010, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the ABR plus an applicable margin, currently 0.625%, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, currently 1.625%, based on the Companys Moodys and S&P rating. The participating banks obtained security interests in certain of the Companys assets to collateralize amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Commitment fees on the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. No amounts were drawn under this agreement at September 26, 2010 and September 27, 2009. The amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $342.9 million and $335.2 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $7.1 million and $14.8 million at September 26, 2010 and September 27, 2009, respectively. The Company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately $115.0 million in the Wild Oats acquisition, of which approximately $21.8 million was paid off during fiscal year 2008. We had outstanding convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $2.7 million at September 28, 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the Company redeemed all remaining debentures at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount totaling approximately $2.7 million. On December 2, 2008, the Company issued 425,000 shares of Series A 8% Redeemable, Convertible Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (Series A Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., for approximately $413.1 million, net of approximately $11.9 million in closing and issuance costs. On October 23, 2009, the Company announced its intention to call all 425,000 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for redemption on November 27, 2009 in accordance with the terms governing such Series A Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In accordance with the terms governing the Series A Preferred Stock, at any time prior to the redemption date, the Series A Preferred Stock could be converted by the holders thereof. On November 26, 2009, the holders converted all 425,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock of the Company. The Company paid cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock totaling $8.5 million and approximately $19.8 million during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment, buildings, and land and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates from 2011 to 2054. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 26, 2010 (in thousands): Less than 1 1 3 3 5 More than 5 Total year years years years Long term debt obligations $ 490,000 $ $ 490,000 $ $ Estimated interest on long term debt obligations 14,602 7,929 6,673 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 37,142 2,061 4,169 4,262 26,650 Operating lease obligations(1) 6,006,492 294,985 645,707 675,812 4,389,988 Total $ 6,548,236 $ 304,975 $ 1,146,549 $ 680,074 $ 4,416,638 (1) Amounts exclude taxes, insurance and other related expenses. At September 26, 2010, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $14.9 million including interest and penalties. Although a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with respective taxing authorities cannot be determined due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits, as of September 26, 2010, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months by approximately $5.4 million. 23 Table of Contents We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Following is a summary of dividends declared on common shares in fiscal year 2008 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Date of Dividend per Date of Date of Total declaration common share record payment amount November 20, 2007 $ 0.20 January 11, 2008 January 22, 2008 $ 27,901 March 10, 2008 0.20 April 11, 2008 April 22, 2008 28,041 June 11, 2008 0.20 July 11, 2008 July 22, 2008 28,057 During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Companys Board of Directors suspended the quarterly cash dividend on common shares. During fiscal year 2008, the Company retired approximately 4.5 million shares held in treasury that had been repurchased for a total of approximately $200 million. On November 8, 2009, the Companys stock repurchase program expired in accordance with its terms. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $0.9 million for fiscal year 2010 and decreases in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $1.3 million and $1.6 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, reflecting the relative strengthening and weakening of the Canadian and United Kingdom currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during these periods. Our principal historical sources of liquidity have been cash generated by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and amounts available under our revolving line of credit. Absent any significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by these sources. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit and other sources of capital will be available to us in the future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements at September 26, 2010 consist of operating leases disclosed in the above contractual obligations table and the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, Long Term Debt, in
