Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview Whole Foods Market, Inc. is the worlds leading retailer of natural and organic foods and Americas first national Certified Organic grocer. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a significant and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. The Company was formed in 1980 and, as of September 25, 2011, operated 311 stores: 299 stores in 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and five stores in the United Kingdom. We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable within their first year of operation; although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation. The Companys average weekly sales and gross profit are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter. Average weekly sales and gross profit are typically lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales, and in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonally slower sales during the summer months. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Stores acquired in purchase acquisitions enter the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger. Identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with expansions of square footage greater than 20% from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week. The Company reports its results of operations on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 52 week years. Economic and Industry Factors Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies across the Company and includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, farmers markets, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of store ambiance and experience, product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. Natural and organic food continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Our commitment to natural and organic products, high quality standards, emphasis on perishable product sales, healthy eating products and education, range of choices based on price, and empowered team members who focus on unparalleled customer service differentiate us from the competition and have created a loyal customer base. We have worked very hard over the last couple of years to successfully improve our price image, particularly in perishables, and we remain focused on maintaining our relative price positioning in the marketplace. We are hopeful we can continue to strike the right balance between rising product costs and our retail pricing based on our contracts, distribution, and tools to manage value. Highlights for Fiscal Year 2011 We are pleased to end fiscal year 2011 with strong sales growth, solid execution, and capital discipline. We believe our pleasurable store experience, outstanding service, high quality standards and differentiated product mix have been the primary drivers of our growth and success. We are committed to maintaining our unique positioning in these areas. We are gaining market share at a faster rate than most public food retailers and attribute much of our success to the progress we have made in our well executed value efforts which have positively impacted our price image while continuing to raise the bar in areas that matter to our customers particularly our quality standards, and health and wellness. These initiatives are aligned with our core customer base and reinforce our position as the authentic retailer of natural and organic foods, further differentiating the Whole Foods Market shopping experience and making us the preferred choice for customers aspiring to a healthier lifestyle. In fiscal year 2011: Sales increased 12.2% over the prior year to $10.11 billion driven by an 8.5% comparable store sales increase. Identical store sales increased 8.4% over the prior year; Income available to common shareholders increased 42.5% over the prior year to $342.6 million; Diluted earnings per share increased 35.0% over the prior year to $1.93; We produced $754.8 million in cash flow from operations and invested $365.0 million in capital expenditures; 20 Table of Contents We repaid the $490 million balance on our term loan; The Companys Board of Directors reinstated a $0.10 quarterly cash dividend to shareholders and we made three dividend payments to shareholders totaling $52.6 million; and We had cash, restricted cash, and investments totaling approximately $799.1 million at the end of the fiscal year. Also during fiscal year 2011, we began opening in store Wellness Clubs. Our Wellness Club offerings include nutrition courses; skill building classes; culinary classes; Supper Clubs and special events; coaching and support; a wellness assessment tool; and access to benefits from a growing local network of community businesses. Members also receive a 10% discount on thousands of designated healthy foods when they shop in stores where Wellness Clubs are located. We are learning and evolving with each Club we open. While still very early, we are pleased with the initial results we are seeing. We hope customers will continue to embrace the concept and that we can expand our offering to more customers in the future. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2012 The following table provides guidance for fiscal year 2012: Sales growth 13% 15% Identical store sales growth 6.5% 8.5% Diluted earnings per share $2.21 $2.26 Diluted earnings per share growth 15% 17% Weighted average square footage growth 7% 8% Fiscal year 2012 will be a 53 week year, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company estimates the impact on earnings from the extra week to be $0.06 per share. On a 52 week to 52 week basis, the company expects total sales growth of 11% to 13% and earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. The Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2012 to be in the range of approximately $410 million to $460 million, which includes the opening of 24 to 27 new stores. The Company is committed to producing cash flows from operations in excess of its capital expenditure requirements on an annual basis, including sufficient cash flow to fund the 62 stores in its current development pipeline. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated: 2011 2010 2009 Sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs 65.0 65.2 65.7 Gross profit 35.0 34.8 34.3 Direct store expenses 26.0 26.4 26.7 General and administrative expenses 3.1 3.0 3.0 Pre opening expenses 0.4 0.4 0.6 Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs 0.1 0.1 0.4 Operating income 5.4 4.9 3.5 Interest expense (0.4 ) (0.5 ) Investment and other income 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 5.5 4.6 3.1 Provision for income taxes 2.1 1.8 1.3 Net income 3.4 2.7 1.8 Preferred stock dividends 0.1 0.3 Income available to common shareholders 3.4 % 2.7 % 1.5 % Figures may not sum due to rounding. Sales Sales totaled approximately $10.11 billion, $9.01 billion and $8.03 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing increases of 12.2%, 12.1% and 1.0% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Comparable store sales increased approximately 8.5% and 7.1% in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively, and decreased approximately 3.1% in fiscal year 2009. Identical store sales increased approximately 8.4% and 6.5% in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively, and decreased approximately 4.3% in fiscal year 2009. As of September 25, 2011, there were 298 locations in the comparable store base. Identical store sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 exclude from the comparable calculation 6, 6 and 12 store relocations, respectively, and 1, 2 and 3 remodels with major expansions, respectively, during portions of each fiscal year. 21 Table of Contents The number of stores open or acquired 52 weeks or less equaled 18, 18 and 15 at the end of fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The sales increase contributed by stores open or acquired within 52 weeks or less totaled approximately $222.0 million, $251.8 million and $234.8 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum. Our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products, higher priced tiers, and to several discretionary categories. With the return of inflation, we are seeing our identical store sales breakout move toward our historical pattern of approximately 60% transaction count and 40% basket size. During fiscal year 2011, our transaction count in identical stores increased 5.7%, an acceleration from the 5.1% increase we experienced in fiscal year 2010. During fiscal year 2011, our basket size increased 2.4% compared to the 1.1% increase for fiscal year 2010, primarily driven by higher average prices per item as we selectively passed through some product cost increases and continued to see signs of customers trading up. Gross Profit Gross profit totaled approximately $3.54 billion, $3.14 billion and $2.76 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net LIFO inventory reserves increased approximately $10.3 million in fiscal year 2011, due primarily to inflation in product cost compared to a decrease in net LIFO inventory reserves of approximately $7.7 million and $5.6 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, due primarily to lower average inventory balances and net deflation in product costs. Despite the 19 basis point impact from the LIFO charge, the Company maintained healthy gross margins by balancing rising product costs while maintaining our relative value position. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, the Company realized sequentially lower cost of goods sold by taking advantage of buying opportunities and improving our distribution, shrink control and inventory management. We have maintained our commitment to offering highly competitive prices on known value items in addition to implementing targeted pricing and promotional strategies. To the extent changes in costs are not reflected in changes in retail prices or changes in retail prices are delayed, our gross profit will be affected. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including seasonality, competition, inflation or deflation. Relative to existing stores, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Direct Store Expenses Direct store expenses totaled approximately $2.63 billion, $2.38 billion and $2.15 billion in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 38 basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2011 primarily reflects leverage of 28 basis points in wages and 19 basis points in depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in costs, including workers compensation expense of 5 basis points as a percentage of sales. During fiscal year 2010, the 34 basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by an 18 basis point leverage in depreciation expense as a percentage of sales and a decrease in asset impairment charges related to ongoing locations of 17 basis points as a percentage of sales. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $310.9 million, $272.4 million and $243.7 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during fiscal year 2011 was primarily driven by higher wages, including wage costs associated with new strategic initiatives, totaling six basis points as a percentage of sales. General and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2010 include share based payment costs related to restricted common stock grants of approximately $4.2 million. General and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 include FTC related legal costs totaling approximately $2.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively. Pre opening Expenses Pre opening expenses totaled approximately $40.9 million, $38.0 million and $49.2 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company opened 18, 16 and 15 new store locations during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average pre opening expense per new store, including pre opening rent, totaled approximately $2.5 million, $2.6 million and $3.0 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Relocation, Store Closure and Lease Termination Costs Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs totaled approximately $8.3 million, $11.2 million and $31.2 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company relocated or closed six, one and six store locations during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 include charges totaling approximately $1.6 million, $6.9 million and $9.5 million, respectively, to increase store closure reserves for increased estimated net lease obligations for closed stores. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a gain totaling approximately $3.2 million related to the sale of a non operating property. The Company recorded a 22 Table of Contents charge totaling approximately $4.8 million in fiscal year 2009 to adjust the carrying value of leases and fixed assets to fair value relating to the potential sale of certain operating locations as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement agreement. Interest Expense Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $3.9 million, $33.0 million and $36.9 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 consists principally of interest expense on the term loan we entered into to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The reductions in net interest expense are primarily due to the repayment of $490 million and $210 million of the term loan during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company had no amounts outstanding on its revolving line of credit at September 25, 2011 or September 26, 2010. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income includes interest income, investment gains and losses, rental income and other income totaling approximately $8.0 million, $6.9 million and $3.4 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company held higher average investment balances during fiscal years 2011 and 2010. Income Taxes Income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 37.9%, 40.3% and 41.5% in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 resulted primarily from the savings realized as a result of certain initiatives and investments. Share Based Payments Share based payment expense before income taxes recognized during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled approximately $27.3 million, $22.9 million and $12.8 million, respectively. Share based payment expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands): 2011 2010 2009 Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs $ 1,396 $ 862 $ 439 Direct store expenses 14,121 10,140 7,152 General and administrative expenses 11,742 11,892 5,204 Share based payment expense before income taxes 27,259 22,894 12,795 Income tax benefit (10,072 ) (9,170 ) (5,222 ) Net share based payment expense $ 17,187 $ 13,724 $ 7,573 The Company intends to keep its stock incentive program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings dilution from share based payment expense will not exceed 10%. The Company believes this strategy is best aligned with its stakeholder philosophy because it limits future earnings dilution from options and at the same time retains the broad based stock option plan, which the Company believes is important to team member morale, its unique corporate culture and its success. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes the Companys cash and short term investments for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands): 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 212,004 $ 131,996 Short term investments available for sale securities 442,320 329,738 Restricted cash 91,956 86,802 Total $ 746,280 $ 548,536 Additionally, the Company held long term investments in available for sale securities totaling approximately $52.8 million and $96.1 million at September 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010, respectively. We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $754.8 million, $585.3 million and $587.7 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income plus non cash expenses and changes in operating working capital. Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $450.7 million, $715.4 million and $386.3 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net purchases of available for sale securities totaled approximately $73.1 million and $425.6 million for fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the 23 Table of Contents funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled approximately $365.0 million, $256.8 million and $314.6 million, respectively, of which approximately $203.5 million, $171.4 million and $248.0 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $161.5 million, $85.4 million and $66.6 million, respectively, was for remodels and other property and equipment expenditures. The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Stores opened Properties Total Stores opened Stores opened during fiscal tendered leases signed during fiscal during fiscal year 2012 as of as of as of year 2010 year 2011 Nov. 2, 2011 Nov. 2, 2011 Nov. 2, 2011(1) Number of stores (including relocations) 16 18 5 16 62 Number of relocations 6 2 7 New areas 4 1 4 19 Average store size (gross square feet) 42,600 39,400 35,900 35,200 35,300 Total square footage 682,200 708,700 179,700 562,700 2,192,000 Average tender period in months 10.9 12.5 Average pre opening expense per store $ 2.6 million $ 2.5 million Average pre opening rent per store $ 1.2 million $ 1.2 million (1) Includes leased properties tendered The following table provides information about the Companys estimated store openings for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Estimated Average new store Ending square openings Relocations square footage footage growth Fiscal year 2012 24 27 1 2 35,000 7% 8% Fiscal year 2013 28 32 2 3 35,000 7% 8% We believe we will produce operating cash flows in excess of the capital expenditures needed to open the 62 stores in our development pipeline. Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Companys flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes Canada and the United Kingdom hold great promise as well. Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $223.6 million and $168.9 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $199.5 million in fiscal year 2009. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $296.7 million, $47.0 million and $4.3 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. During fiscal year 2010, the Company repaid the $210 million portion of the term loan that was not subject to an interest rate swap agreement. During fiscal year 2011, the Company repaid the $490 million outstanding balance on the term loan. The Company also has outstanding a $350 million revolving line of credit, which is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock in our subsidiaries, that extends to August 2012. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 25, 2011, we were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the alternative base rate (ABR) plus an applicable margin, currently 0.375%, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, currently 1.375%, based on the Companys S&P rating. The participating banks hold security interests in certain of the Companys assets to collateralize amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Commitment fees on the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. No amounts were drawn under this agreement at September 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010. The amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $348.6 million and $342.9 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.4 million and $7.1 million at September 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010, respectively. 24 Table of Contents We had outstanding convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $2.7 million at September 28, 2008. In fiscal year 2009, the Company redeemed all remaining debentures at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount totaling approximately $2.7 million. On December 8, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors reinstated a $0.10 quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. During fiscal year 2011 the Company made three quarterly dividend payments to shareholders totaling approximately $52.6 million. Following is a summary of dividends declared on common shares in fiscal year 2011 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Date of Dividend per Date of Date of Total declaration common share record payment amount December 8, 2010 $ 0.10 January 10, 2011 January 20, 2011 $ 17,348 February 27, 2011 0.10 April 12, 2011 April 22, 2011 17,572 June 7, 2011 0.10 June 24, 2011 July 5, 2011 17,700 September 8, 2011 0.10 September 19, 2011 September 29, 2011 17,827 (1) (1) Dividend accrued at September 25, 2011 On November 2, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors announced a 40% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. On December 2, 2008, the Company issued 425,000 shares of Series A 8% Redeemable, Convertible Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (Series A Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., for approximately $413.1 million, net of approximately $11.9 million in closing and issuance costs. On October 23, 2009, the Company announced its intention to call all 425,000 outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for redemption on November 27, 2009 in accordance with the terms governing such Series A Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In accordance with the terms governing the Series A Preferred Stock, at any time prior to the redemption date, the Series A Preferred Stock could be converted by the holders thereof. On November 26, 2009, the holders converted all 425,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock of the Company. The Company paid cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock totaling $8.5 million and approximately $19.8 million during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. On November 2, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $200 million through November 1, 2013. The specific timing and repurchase of future amounts will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors and will be made using the Companys available resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Companys discretion. The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment, buildings, and land and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates from 2012 to 2054. The following table shows payments due by period on contractual obligations as of September 25, 2011 (in thousands): Less than 1 1 3 3 5 More than 5 Total year years years years Capital lease obligations (including interest) $ 34,971 $ 2,100 $ 4,174 $ 4,169 $ 24,528 Operating lease obligations(1) 6,370,761 319,519 704,457 734,301 4,612,484 Total $ 6,405,732 $ 321,619 $ 708,631 $ 738,470 $ 4,637,012 (1)Amounts exclude taxes, insurance and other related expenses. At September 25, 2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $9.8 million including interest and penalties. Although a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with respective taxing authorities cannot be determined due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits, as of September 25, 2011, the Company does not expect tax audit resolutions will reduce its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 25 Table of Contents We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in decreases in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $0.6 million and $1.3 million for fiscal years 2011 and 2009 and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $0.9 million for fiscal year 2010, reflecting the relative strengthening and weakening of the Canadian and United Kingdom currencies compared to the U.S. dollar during these periods. Our principal historical sources of liquidity have been cash generated by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and amounts available under our revolving line of credit. Absent any significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by these sources. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit and other sources of capital will be available to us in the future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements at September 25, 2011 consist of operating leases disclosed in the above contractual obligations table and the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, Long Term Debt, in
