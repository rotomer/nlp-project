Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWhole Foods Market, Inc. is the worlds leading retailer of natural and organic foods and Americas first national Certified Organic grocer. Our Company mission is to promote the vitality and well being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a significant and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance. The Company was formed in 1980 and, as of September 30, 2012, operated 335 stores: 322 stores in 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; 7 stores in Canada; and 6 stores in the United Kingdom. We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets.Our continued growth depends on our ability to increase sales in our identical stores and open new stores. New stores generally become profitable within their first year of operation; although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation. The Companys average weekly sales and gross profit are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter. Average weekly sales and gross profit are typically lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales, and in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonally slower sales during the summer months.Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Stores acquired in purchase acquisitions enter the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger. Identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with major expansions of square footage greater than 20% from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week.The Company reports its results of operations on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal year 2012 was a 53 week year and fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were 52 week years.Economic and Industry FactorsFood retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies across the Company and includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers, smaller specialty stores, farmers markets and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of store ambiance and experience, product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. Natural product sales through retail channels continue to experience significant growth, increasing 10% over the prior year, according to Natural Foods Merchandiser.We offer a broad and differentiated selection of high quality natural and organic products with a strong emphasis on perishable foods. We aspire to become an international brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but also with being the highest quality food retailer in every community in which we are located.Highlights for Fiscal Year 2012We ended fiscal year 2012 with strong sales growth and record fourth quarter results, delivering the best year in our Companys 32 year history. The pace of new store openings and lease signings continues to increase, and our accelerated growth plans are on track. Our commitment to natural and organic products, local products, high quality standards, emphasis on perishable product sales, healthy eating products and education, range of choices based on price, and empowered team members who focus on unparalleled customer service differentiate us from the competition and have created a loyal customer base. We continue to evaluate and strengthen our value offerings, providing a clear range of choices in every category. We believe our focus in these areas has played a key role in driving our sales growth, and we are committed to maintaining our unique positioning. In fiscal year 2012, a 53 week year:Sales increased 15.7% over the prior year to $11.70 billion driven by an 8.7% comparable store sales increase and identical store sales increased 8.4% over the prior year; Net income increased 35.9% over the prior year to $465.6 million; Diluted earnings per share increased 30.6% over the prior year to $2.52;EBITDA totaled $1.06 billion, an increase of 26.4% over the prior year;We produced $919.7 million in cash flow from operations and invested $456.2 million in capital expenditures, of which $261.7 million related to new locations;We made four dividend payments to common shareholders totaling $94.5 million; andWe had cash, restricted cash, and investments totaling $1.54 billion at the end of the fiscal year.20Table of ContentsOutlook for Fiscal Year 2013The following table provides guidance for fiscal year 2013:Sales growth10% 12%Comparable store sales growth6.5% 8.5%Identical store sales growth6.0% 8.0%General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales3.1%Operating income as a percentage of sales6.6% 6.7%Diluted earnings per share$2.83 $2.87Diluted earnings per share growth12% 14%Tax rate38.6% 39.0%Ending square footage growth8%Fiscal year 2013 will be a 52 week year, with twelve weeks in the fourth fiscal quarter. On a 52 week to 52 week basis, the Company expects total sales growth of 12% to 14% and diluted earnings per share growth of 14% to 16%.The Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of approximately $565 million to $615 million, which includes the opening of approximately 32 to 34 new stores. The Company is committed to producing cash flows from operations in excess of its capital expenditure requirements on an annual basis, including sufficient cash flow to fund the 79 stores in its current development pipeline.Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth the Companys statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales: 2012 2011 2010Sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs64.5 65.0 65.2Gross profit35.5 35.0 34.8Direct store expenses25.5 26.0 26.4General and administrative expenses3.2 3.1 3.0Pre opening expenses0.4 0.4 0.4Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs0.1 0.1 0.1Operating income6.4 5.4 4.9Interest expense (0.4)Investment and other income0.1 0.1 0.1Income before income taxes6.4 5.5 4.6Provision for income taxes2.4 2.1 1.8Net income4.0 3.4 2.7Preferred stock dividends 0.1Income available to common shareholders4.0 % 3.4 % 2.7 %Figures may not sum due to rounding.SalesSales totaled approximately $11.70 billion, $10.11 billion and $9.01 billion in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing increases of 15.7%, 12.2% and 12.1% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Sales increases for all years are due to comparable store sales increases and stores open or acquired less than one fiscal year, plus an additional week of sales in fiscal year 2012. Comparable store sales increased approximately 8.7%, 8.5% and 7.1% in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Identical store sales increased approximately 8.4%, 8.4% and 6.5% in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The sales increase contributed by stores open or acquired less than one fiscal year totaled approximately $293.8 million, $222.0 million and $251.8 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.21Table of ContentsComparable stores, relocated stores and remodels excluded from the identical store base, identical stores, and stores open less than one fiscal year were as follows: 2012 2011 2010Comparable stores311 298 281Relocated stores(7) (6) (6)Remodels with major expansions(3) (1) (2)Identical stores301 291 273 Stores open less than one fiscal year25 18 18We believe our efforts around value and differentiation continue to be a significant contributor to our momentum. Our customers have shifted their buying toward branded and organic products, higher priced tiers, and to several discretionary categories. With the moderation of inflation, we saw our identical store sales breakout move toward approximately 80% transaction count and 20% basket size. During fiscal year 2012, our transaction count in identical stores increased 6.7%, continuing to accelerate from the 5.7% increase we experienced in fiscal year 2011. The increase in transaction growth helped to offset the slower increase in basket size year over year. Basket size is partially impacted by our growth in new customers, who tend to have a smaller average basket size. During fiscal year 2012, our basket size increased 1.7% compared to the 2.4% increase for fiscal year 2011.Gross ProfitGross profit totaled approximately $4.16 billion, $3.54 billion and $3.14 billion in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net LIFO inventory reserves increased approximately $0.1 million and $10.3 million in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. During fiscal year 2010, net LIFO inventory reserves decreased approximately $7.7 million due primarily to lower average inventory balances and net deflation in product costs. Moderation of inflation during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 resulted in an almost flat net LIFO inventory reserve, as compared to rising product costs in the prior year. Excluding the LIFO charge, gross profit increased 43 basis points, driven by improvement in occupancy costs and costs of goods sold. During fiscal year 2011, despite the 19 basis point impact from the LIFO charge, the Company maintained healthy gross margins by balancing rising product costs while maintaining our relative value position. The Company realized sequentially lower cost of goods sold during fiscal year 2010 by taking advantage of buying opportunities and improving our distribution, shrink control and inventory management.We have maintained our commitment to offering highly competitive prices on known value items in addition to implementing targeted pricing and promotional strategies. The success of this ongoing strategy is reflected in our continued sales momentum and the results from our most recent competitive survey. The survey indicates we dramatically improved our pricing position versus our competitors during fiscal year 2012, resulting in our most competitive position in more than three years.To the extent changes in costs are not reflected in changes in retail prices or changes in retail prices are delayed, our gross profit will be affected. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of commodity costs or a host of other factors, including possible supply shortages, and extreme weather related disruptions. Relative to existing stores, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams.Direct Store ExpensesDirect store expenses totaled approximately $2.98 billion, $2.63 billion and $2.38 billion in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 51 basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2012 primarily reflects leverage of 25 basis points in wages, 16 basis points in depreciation expense, and 8 basis points in healthcare costs. During fiscal year 2011, the 38 basis point decrease in direct store expenses as a percentage of sales primarily reflects leverage of 28 basis points in wages and 19 basis points in depreciation expense, partially offset by an increase in costs, including workers compensation expense of 5 basis points as a percentage of sales.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses totaled approximately $372.1 million, $310.9 million and $272.4 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Higher wages and share based payment expense, resulting primarily from our higher stock price, drove the 10 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during fiscal year 2012. During fiscal year 2011, the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by higher wages, including wage costs associated with new strategic initiatives, totaling 6 basis points as a percentage of sales. 22Table of ContentsShare based payment expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 2012 2011 2010Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs$1,874 $1,396 $862Direct store expenses22,647 14,121 10,140General and administrative expenses17,767 11,742 11,892Share based payment expense before income taxes42,288 27,259 22,894Income tax benefit(15,759) (10,072) (9,170)Net share based payment expense$26,529 $17,187 $13,724Pre opening ExpensesPre opening expenses totaled approximately $46.9 million, $40.9 million and $38.0 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company opened 25, 18 and 16 new store locations during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Average pre opening expense per new store opened in the year indicated, including pre opening rent, totaled approximately $1.7 million, $2.5 million and $2.6 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Relocation, Store Closure and Lease Termination CostsRelocation, store closure and lease termination costs totaled approximately $9.9 million, $8.3 million and $11.2 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company relocated or closed one, six and one store locations during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Relocation, store closure and lease termination costs for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 include charges totaling approximately $2.4 million, $1.6 million and $6.9 million, respectively, to increase store closure reserves for increased estimated net lease obligations for closed stores. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a gain totaling approximately $3.2 million related to the sale of a non operating property.Interest ExpenseInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $0.4 million, $3.9 million and $33.0 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest expense for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 consists principally of interest expense on the $700 million term loan we entered into to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The reductions in interest expense are primarily due to the repayment of $490 million and $210 million of the term loan during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company had no long term debt amounts outstanding during fiscal year 2012, and its revolving line of credit expired in August 2012.Investment and Other IncomeInvestment and other income which includes interest income, investment gains and losses, rental income and other income totaled approximately $8.9 million, $8.0 million and $6.9 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company held higher average investment balances during fiscal years 2012 and 2011.Income TaxesIncome taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of approximately 38.1%, 37.9% and 40.3% in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The lower effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 reflect the tax effects of a reduction of reserves for uncertain tax positions and increased state tax credits in fiscal year 2012, and the tax effects of certain initiatives and investments in both fiscal years.Non GAAP measuresIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. We believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation.23Table of ContentsThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the non GAAP financial measure EBITDA to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income plus non cash expenses and changes in operating working capital.24Table of ContentsNet cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $1.34 billion, $450.7 million and $715.4 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net purchases of available for sale securities totaled approximately $871.3 million, $73.1 million and $425.6 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of landlord incentives and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled approximately $456.2 million, $365.0 million and $256.8 million, respectively, of which approximately $261.7 million, $203.5 million and $171.4 million, respectively, was for new store development and approximately $194.5 million, $161.5 million and $85.4 million, respectively, was for remodels and other property and equipment expenditures. The following table provides information about the Companys store development activities: Stores opened during fiscal year 2011Stores opened during fiscal year 2012Stores opened during fiscal year 2013 as of Nov. 7, 2012Properties tendered as of Nov. 7, 2012Total leases signed as of Nov. 7, 2012 (1)Number of stores (including relocations)182571279Number of relocations61410New markets84418Average store size (gross square feet)39,40035,50033,50037,60036,600Total square footage708,700887,400234,800450,8002,896,300Average tender period in months12.57.95.9 Average pre opening expense per store$2.5 million$1.7 million Average pre opening rent per store$1.2 million$0.6 million (1) Includes leases for properties tenderedThe following table provides information about the Companys estimated store openings for fiscal years 2013 and 2014: EstimatedopeningsRelocationsAveragenew storesquare footageEnding squarefootage growthFiscal year 201332 34534,0008%Fiscal year 201433 382 338,0008% 9%On October 26, 2012, the Company announced plans to purchase six leases, averaging 31,000 square feet in size, from Johnnies Foodmaster. Johnnies Foodmaster will close the stores prior to the anticipated November 30, 2012 transaction closing date. The Company plans to remodel and reopen the locations as Whole Foods Market stores before the end of September 2013. The leases related to this transaction are included in the current development pipeline in the tables above.We believe we will produce operating cash flows in excess of the capital expenditures needed to open the 79 stores in our current development pipeline.Over the long term, the Company considers 1,000 stores to be a reasonable indication of its market opportunity in the United States as the Whole Foods Market brand continues to strengthen, consumer demand for natural and organic products continues to increase, and the Companys flexibility on new store size opens up additional market opportunities. The Company believes significant opportunities exist in Canada and the United Kingdom as well. Our growth strategy is to expand primarily through new store openings, with the majority of our new stores to fall in the range of 35,000 to 45,000 square feet going forward.Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $297.2 million in fiscal year 2012. Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $223.6 million and $168.9 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. During fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. During fiscal year 2010, the Company repaid the $210 million portion of the term loan that was not subject to an interest rate swap agreement. During fiscal year 2011, the Company repaid the $490 million outstanding balance on the term loan. The Company also had outstanding a $350 million revolving line of credit that expired August 2012. The Companys obligations under the facility were secured by liens on certain of the Companys assets, including stock of its subsidiaries. The Company elected not to renew the revolving line of credit, due to its significant cash position. No amounts were drawn under this agreement during fiscal year 2012 or 2011.25Table of ContentsNet proceeds to the Company from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $370.2 million, $296.7 million and $47.0 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company intends to keep its broad based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings dilution from share based payment expense will not exceed 10%. The Company believes this strategy is best aligned with its stakeholder philosophy because it limits future earnings dilution from options and at the same time retains the broad based stock option plan, which the Company believes is important to team member morale, its unique corporate culture and its success. At September 30, 2012, September 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010, approximately 8.4 million shares, 11.7 million shares, and 12.7 million shares of our common stock, respectively, were available for future stock incentive grants.On December 8, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors reinstated a $0.10 quarterly cash dividend to shareholders. During fiscal year 2011, the Company made three quarterly dividend payments to shareholders totaling approximately $52.6 million. On November 2, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 40% to $0.14 per common share. During fiscal year 2012, the Company made four quarterly dividend payments to shareholders totaling approximately $94.5 million.Following is a summary of dividends declared per common share during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per share amounts):Date of declarationDividend percommon share Date of record Date of payment Total amountFiscal year 2012: November 2, 2011$0.14 January 13, 2012 January 24, 2012 $25,230March 9, 20120.14 April 5, 2012 April 17, 2012 25,614May 30, 20120.14 June 29, 2012 July 10, 2012 25,834September 6, 2012 (1)0.14 September 28, 2012 October 9, 2012 25,959Fiscal year 2011: December 8, 2010$0.10 January 10, 2011 January 20, 2011 $17,348February 27, 20110.10 April 12, 2011 April 22, 2011 17,572June 7, 20110.10 June 24, 2011 July 5, 2011 17,700September 8, 20110.10 September 19, 2011 September 29, 2011 17,827(1) Dividend accrued at September 30, 2012 On November 7, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors announced a 43% increase in the Companys quarterly dividend to $0.20 per common share. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.On November 2, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $200 million through November 1, 2013. During fiscal year 2012 the Company repurchased approximately 346,000 shares of the Companys common stock on the open market at an average price of $82.69 per share. The total cost of shares held in treasury as of September 30, 2012 was approximately $28.6 million.On November 15, 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program whereby the Company may repurchase an amount of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company up to an aggregate amount of $300 million through December 31, 2014. This repurchase program is in addition to, and does not supersede or modify, the Companys previously disclosed program to repurchase an amount of outstanding shares of common stock having an aggregate value of up to $200 million from time to time through November 1, 2013, of which approximately $171.4 million remains available.Under the repurchase programs, purchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases or purchases through a Rule 10b5 1 trading plan, all in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The specific timing, price and size of purchases will depend on prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions, and other considerations. The repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Companys discretion.On December 2, 2008, the Company issued 425,000 shares of Series A 8% Redeemable, Convertible Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (Series A Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., for 26Table of Contentsapproximately $413.1 million, net of approximately $11.9 million in closing and issuance costs. On November 26, 2009, the holders converted all 425,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into approximately 29.7 million shares of common stock of the Company. During fiscal year 2010, the Company paid cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock totaling $8.5 million.The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of certain equipment, buildings and land, and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates through 2054.

Although a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with respective taxing authorities cannot be determined due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits, as of September 30, 2012, the Company does not expect tax audit resolution will reduce its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. We periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The effect of exchange rate changes on cash included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows resulted in increases in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million for fiscal years 2012 and 2010, respectively, and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $0.6 million for fiscal year 2011, reflecting the relative strengthening and weakening of the Canadian dollar and pound sterling compared to the U.S. dollar during these periods.Our principal historical sources of liquidity have included cash generated by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and short term investments. Absent any significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months will be funded by these sources.

Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances.We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in
