ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2001. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. The Company discusses in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1, under the section "Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward Looking Statements" of this report. This discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions As further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. However, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates, and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty, are related to our accounting for landfills and environmental liabilities. Landfill Airspace Amortization and Final Closure/Post Closure Costs We expense amounts for landfill airspace usage and landfill final closure and post closure costs for each ton of waste accepted for disposal at our landfills. In determining the amount to expense for each ton of waste accepted, we estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity and the total final closure and post closure costs for each landfill site. Our engineers also estimate the tonnage capacity of the landfill. The expense for each ton is then calculated based on the total costs remaining and the total remaining tonnage capacity. Estimates for projected landfill site costs and for final closure and post closure costs are developed using input from the Companys engineers and accountants and are reviewed by management, typically at least once per year. The estimates for landfill final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in, where appropriate, inflation and discount rates. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the net book value recorded for capitalized landfill site costs was $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, we expect to incur $7.1 billion related to future construction activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites. The future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed. The average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the 302 landfills operating at December 31, 2001 was $3.70 per ton as compared to $3.84 for the 305 landfills at December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had recorded landfill final closure and post closure liabilities of $625 million and $613 million, respectively. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill final closure and post closure as of December 31, 2001 is approximately $2.4 billion. Additional closure and post closure costs in excess of those recorded at December 31, 2001 will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total present value of estimated final closure and post closure costs will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time each site discontinues accepting waste and is closed. The average landfill final closure and post closure expense, on a per ton basis, for the 302 landfills operating at December 31, 2001 was $0.24 per ton as compared to $0.30 for the 305 landfills at December 31, 2000. This decrease in average landfill final closure and post closure rates from 2000 to 2001 was caused primarily by three facilities with significantly higher than normal per ton amortization rates. As these three facilities neared closure in 2000, based on specific facts and circumstances, we were required to increase their final closure and post closure rates in order to be adequately accrued for final closure and post closure at the time the landfills closed. In determining the amounts to expense for airspace amortization and final closure and post closure costs, our engineers estimate the unused permitted airspace at each landfill. We will also consider expansion airspace in our estimate of available airspace when we believe the success of obtaining such an airspace expansion is probable. The criteria we use for evaluating the probability of obtaining an expansion permit to landfill airspace at existing sites are as follows: Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; 18 At the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life, it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Airspace and related costs, including additional final closure and post closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. Additionally, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, the expansion permit application must generally be expected to be submitted within one year, and the expansion permit must be expected to be received within two to five years. Exceptions to these criteria must be approved through a landfill specific approval process that includes the approval from the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 105 landfills with probable expansions included in the landfill airspace calculations at December 31, 2001, 27 probable landfill expansions required the Chief Financial Officer to approve an exception to the criteria. Approximately two thirds of these exceptions were due to legal or community issues that could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the one year limit, which in most cases were due to state specific permitting procedures. We have generally been successful in receiving approvals for expansions pursued; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining landfill expansions in the future. In some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable becomes unlikely. The estimates and assumptions used in developing this information are reviewed by our engineers and accountants at least annually, and we believe them to be reasonable. However, to the extent that such estimates, or the assumptions used to make those estimates, prove to be incorrect, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes to remote, the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion will be charged against earnings, net of any capitalized expenditures and advances that will be recoverable, through sale or otherwise. Additionally, the landfills future operations will typically reflect lower profitability due to higher amortization rates, final closure and post closure rates, and expenses related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. The landfill may also become subject to impairment, which could be material to the results of operations of any individual reporting period. Environmental Remediation Liabilities Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a particular site. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances. Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan, and (iii) the extent of other parties share of responsibility. While the precise amount of these future remediation costs cannot be determined with absolute certainty, we have estimated that the aggregate cost as of December 31, 2001 is approximately $376 million. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had recorded liabilities of $321 million and $349 million, respectively, for the present value of remediation costs of our sites. Our engineers and accountants also specifically review the estimates and assumptions related to environmental remediation liabilities at least annually. In many circumstances the actual costs related to these liabilities which we have estimated or assumed may not be known for decades into the future. However, we believe that based on our extensive experience in the environmental services business and the large number of sites we have dealt with, we have the ability to reasonably estimate our aggregate liability. As additional information becomes available, estimates are adjusted as necessary. It is possible that technological, regulatory 19 or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies, the nonexistence or inability of other potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could prove our estimates to be inaccurate, necessitating the recording of additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. 1999 ACCOUNTING CHARGES AND ADJUSTMENTS In 1999, we initiated a comprehensive internal review of our accounting records, systems, processes and controls at the direction of our Board of Directors. As discussed below, and in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we experienced significant difficulty in the integration and conversion of information and accounting systems after the WM Holdings Merger, which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. As a result of these systems and process issues, and other issues raised during the 1999 accounting review, certain charges and adjustments were recorded, as discussed below. The review was completed such that we were able to record related adjustments in our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 1999. The amounts we recorded as a result of the review had a material effect on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the 1999 accounting charges and adjustments. 21 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period to period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the various statement of operations line items.

Our revenues decreased in 2000 and 2001 primarily because we sold our international operations outside of North America, most of our non solid waste businesses, and certain non integrated NASW operations pursuant to our strategic plan. As shown below, NASW is our principal reportable segment. Our "Other" segment was reported in previous years as WM International and Non Solid Waste. Beginning in 1999, and continuing through 2000 and into 2001, we sold all operations that had previously been reported in WM International and most of the operations that had been reported in Non Solid Waste. Operating revenues by reportable segment (in millions): OPERATING REVENUES [CHART] 2001 2000 1999 NASW $11,010 $11,218 $10,685 Other $312 $1,274 $ 2,442 TOTAL $11,322 $12,492 $13,127 NASW operating revenue mix (in millions): [CHART] 2001 2000 1999 Collection $7,584 $7,675 $ 7,553 Disposal $3,393 $3,366 $ 3,267 Transfer $1,435 $1,394 $ 1,195 Recycling and other $592 $805 $ 664 Intercompany $(1,994) $(2,022) $(1,994) TOTAL $11,010 $11,218 $10,685 24 Our NASW operating revenues generally come from fees charged for our collection, disposal, and transfer station services. A portion of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services is billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded upon receipt of payment and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting, and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. NASW revenues decreased by $208 million in 2001 from 2000 due primarily to the sales of our non integrated NASW operations during 2000 and, to a lesser extent, in 2001. Additionally, we experienced negative internal growth in our NASW operations of 0.7% (or $78 million) in 2001. Internal growth was negatively impacted by declines in the prices of recyclable commodities of 1.5% (or $161 million) as well as lower volumes of 0.7% (or $80 million) compared to 2000. The negative volume is largely attributable to the overall slowing of the North American economy, our terminating unprofitable accounts, and the impact of our policy change for third party brokers, which required more stringent contract requirements, thereby resulting in the loss of some brokered waste. Also contributing to the decline in NASW operating revenues were fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Canadian dollar, which reduced revenues by $20 million. In addition, in 2001 the Company recognized negative fair market value adjustments of $11 million for pulp and paper commodity derivatives with Enron as the counterparty. These derivatives were intended to mitigate the price risk associated with pulp and paper commodities that we process and sell to third parties. Offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition of certain NASW operations in 2001 and the year over year effect of acquisitions of NASW operations in 2000. Our NASW operating revenues increased by $533 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 mostly because we had internal growth in comparable operations. We had a 1.4% (or $150 million) increase in revenues from pricing increases and a 2.5% (or $267 million) increase in revenues from volume increases. During the first half of 2000, the pricing in the recyclable materials markets favorably impacted overall pricing increases, but those improvements were offset by the significant recyclable materials market downturn in the second half of 2000. Additionally, we implemented a fuel surcharge in March 2000 to mitigate the significant increase in the cost of fuel. If we excluded the effects of the price increases for recyclable materials and the fuel surcharge, there was a price increase of 0.6% in 2000 compared to 1999. Acquisitions of NASW businesses in 2000 and the full year effect of acquisitions that were completed in 1999 increased NASW operating revenue by 2.7% in 2000 as compared to 1999, but that increase was offset by the sales of the non integrated NASW operations. Foreign currency fluctuations with the Canadian dollar also negatively impacted operating revenues during 2000. OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION SHOWN BELOW) Our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits, fuel, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations, and accruals for future landfill final closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation. Certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed, and include acquisition, engineering, upgrading, construction, capitalized interest, and permitting costs. All indirect expenses, such as administrative salaries and general corporate overhead, are expensed in the period incurred. We sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial, defense and tort claim costs at a number of our sites. Such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses. Our operating costs and expenses decreased 11.6% in 2001 as compared to 2000, and decreased 8.8% in 2000 as compared to 1999. As a percentage of operating revenues, operating costs and expenses decreased from 63.0% in 1999, to 60.4% in 2000 and decreased again to 58.9% in 2001. The year to year decline in operating costs and expenses between 1999 and 2001 was primarily caused by the sales of our WM International, Non Solid Waste and non integrated NASW operations. These sales 25 occurred throughout 2000 and into 2001. Adding to the decrease was the effect of the volume declines in 2001 as compared to 2000 as described in the discussion of NASW operating revenues. As a percentage of revenues, operating costs and expenses were exceptionally high in 1999 because of the difficulties we had integrating operations after the WM Holdings Merger. In 2000, operating costs and expenses decreased as we started improving our procurement practices and developing more standardized operating procedures, although the decrease as a percentage of revenue was not as great due to the decrease in revenues in the same period. Our improvements continued and caused further decreases in operating costs and expenses into 2001. Additionally, in 2001 we implemented market strategy and procurement initiatives, as well as other cost saving initiatives, such as preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in repair and maintenance costs. Finally, in 2001 we aggressively pursued our claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses, recovering approximately $105 million in 2001 as compared to $2 million in 2000 and $7 million in 1999. These recoveries of environmental expenses are recorded as an offset to operating costs and expenses. If we excluded the insurance recoveries, operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues were unaffected in 1999 and 2000, and would have been 59.8% in 2001. As part of our ongoing operations, we review our requirements for remediation and other environmental liabilities based on an analysis of, among other things, the regulatory context surrounding landfills, site specific environmental issues and remaining airspace capacity in light of changes to operational efficiencies. Accordingly, revisions to remediation liability requirements may result in upward or downward adjustments to income from operations in any given period. Adjustments for final closure and post closure estimates are accounted for prospectively over the remaining capacity of the operating landfill. There was no impact on operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues for revisions to remedial environmental and similar liabilities in 2001 or 2000, and there was a decrease of 0.5% in 1999. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Our selling, general and administrative expenses include management salaries, clerical and administrative costs, professional services, facility rentals, provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs, as well as costs related to our marketing and sales force. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $182 million, or 9.5%, in 2000 compared to 1999 and decreased $116 million, or 6.7%, in 2001 compared to 2000. As a percentage of operating revenues, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 14.3% for 2001, 13.9% for 2000 and 14.6% for 1999. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2001 as compared to 2000 is due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout 2000. In addition, as discussed below, we had significant costs in 2000 related to accounting and process improvement initiatives. These costs were not as significant in 2001, as we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and substantially complete our process improvement initiatives in the second half of 2000. Offsetting these decreases were costs related to corporate staffing increases, which began primarily in 2000 and continued in 2001. In 2000, we incurred significant costs for our process improvement initiatives and the accounting assistance that began as part of our 1999 accounting review. These costs were mainly in the first half of 2000 because, by the second half of 2000, we had stabilized our accounting systems and completed our process improvement initiatives, which significantly reduced our ongoing need for these services. In 2000, we incurred approximately $196 million for professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise information systems. Approximately $51 million related to our divestitures, improvements to our billing systems and verification of our customer base, and legal fees related to certain stockholder litigation and other SEC matters was also recorded in 2000. However, in 2000 we were successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in 1999, favorably impacting our provision for bad debt in 2000, which decreased from $268 million in 1999 to $14 million in 2000. We also experienced permanent staffing increases at our corporate office throughout 2000, particularly in the area of information systems and corporate accounting and finance. 26 Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1999 included $403 million in adjustments resulting from the 1999 accounting review, some of which are recurring in nature and should be expected in future periods. These significant adjustments include an increase of $168 million relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts and $63 million in costs for insurance adjustments, accounting, legal and other professional services. These costs were primarily related to litigation and investigations we conducted in 1999 in connection with the announcements of our lower expectations for earnings per share in July and August 1999. Additionally, our administrative costs in 1999, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, were exceptionally high due to the increased costs to perform administrative functions attributable to our integration problems after the WM Holdings Merger. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of 40 years or less, commencing on the dates of the respective acquisitions; (ii) amortization of other intangible assets on a straight line basis from 3 to 40 years; (iii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from 3 to 50 years; and (iv) amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 4.1% in 2001 as compared to 2000 and decreased 11.5% in 2000 as compared to 1999. As a percentage of operating revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 12.1% in 2001, 11.4% in 2000 and 12.3% in 1999. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2001 is attributable to the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout 2000, more cost effective use of our landfill assets in 2001 and a temporary increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays in receiving new equipment in the first half of 2001. As a percentage of operating revenues, depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily because of the full year suspension of depreciation in 2000 on fixed assets which were held for sale. The depreciation suspension for 2000 for these held for sale operations prior to those operations being sold was $99 million, or 0.8% of operating revenues. The depreciation suspended in 1999 for operations held for sale, which all occurred in the fourth quarter of 1999, was $46 million, or 0.3% of operating revenue. However, the decreases in depreciation and amortization expense were partially offset by increased landfill airspace amortization in 2000 due to increases in disposal volumes at our landfills. We also experienced higher airspace amortization expense in 2000 as compared to the prior years, due to higher airspace amortization rates as a result of our more stringent criteria for evaluating the probability of obtaining airspace expansions, which was effective starting in the third quarter of 1999. Included in depreciation and amortization expense for 1999 are adjustments resulting from the 1999 accounting review. These adjustments primarily included adjustments to increases to landfill amortization expenses as a result of the comprehensive review of the NASW landfill expansion projects. MERGER AND ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND UNUSUAL ITEMS In 2001, 2000 and 1999, we had significant charges related to merger and acquisition related costs, asset impairments and unusual items. In 1999, these were charges that we identified during our 1999 accounting review, or that resulted from our losses from businesses sold and held for sale adjustments for businesses to be sold. In 2000, these costs were primarily due to our sale of our international operations outside of North America and the termination of WM Holdings defined benefit pension plan, which are more fully described in Notes 2 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements. In 2001, expenses included in this category were primarily attributable to the agreement that was reached to settle the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in July 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws which, net of the recovery from the stockholders derivative suit against the Companys auditor, resulted in a charge of $374 million. The settlement of the class action, which is subject to court approval, provides for our payment to the class of $457 million. We believe the payment, which is expected to be made in the second half of 2002, will result in a net cash outflow of approximately $230 to $240 million after 27 considering insurance, tax deductions and related settlement costs. In addition, we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately $15 million related to our international operations outside of North America along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in an operation in Mexico of approximately $28 million. Offsetting this expense was a net gain of $24 million (comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of $109 million and a held for use impairment of $85 million) from our decision during the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our IPPs, and the reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of our IPPs from held for sale to held for use. Also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 are reversals of certain loss contract reserves of $13 million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements, and other unusual items. INTEREST EXPENSE Our interest expense decreased in 2001 and 2000 as compared to 1999 because we paid down debt throughout 2000 and 2001 with proceeds from our divestitures and our cash flows from operations. In addition, contributing to the decrease was a $39 million offset to interest expense for interest rate swaps we used to manage our interest rate exposure. Partially offsetting the overall decrease in interest expense was a decrease in capitalized interest recorded from period to period due to an overall decrease in interest rates. We capitalized interest of $16 million, $22 million and $34 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES We recorded a provision for income taxes of $284 million, $418 million and $232 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 36.1%, 130.2% and 142.3% for each of the three years, respectively. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for these years is primarily due to state and local income taxes; non deductible costs related to acquired intangibles; non deductible costs associated with the impairment and divestiture of certain businesses and other charges and adjustments related to the 1999 accounting review as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, and; the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested. Additionally, in 2001 scheduled Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of $42 million, which was offset in part by an expense of $24 million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in Canada. The non recurring $42 million benefit arising from the change in Canadian tax rates resulted in a 5.3% reduction in the Companys overall effective income tax rate in 2001. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company operates in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive and we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. There are several key factors considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing. These factors include: the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows; 28 our asset base; and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. In addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations, we have capital requirements for (i) capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites, as well as new trucks and equipment for collection operations, (ii) refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and (iii) business acquisitions. For 2002, we currently expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion for capital expenditures and approximately $250 million for the purchases of businesses. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001 (in millions) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years: 2002 2003 2005 2006+ TOTAL Long term debt (including current maturities)..... $515 $2,224 $5,485 $ 8,224 Expected aggregate environmental liabilities (based on current cost)......................... 121 183 2,468 2,772 Non cancellable rental obligations................ 130 354 476 960 Total contractual cash obligations(a)............. $766 $2,761 $8,429 $11,956 (a) These contractual obligations do not include our accounts payable and accrued liabilities (other than environmental liabilities) which we expect to be paid in 2002, nor do they include other long term liabilities which we generally expect to be settled over the next several years. Our strategy is to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations first from internally generated funds. Historically, we have also, when appropriate, obtained financing from issuing debt and common stock. The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year........ $ 730 $ 94 $ 181 Cash provided by operating activities................... $ 2,355 $ 2,125 $ 1,689 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities......... $(1,232) $ 1,072 $(2,017) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities......... $ (485) $(3,279) $ 426 In 1999, cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by our integration efforts in connection with the WM Holdings Merger and the merger with Eastern Environmental Services, Inc. ("Eastern") (the "Eastern Merger"), which both occurred in 1998, and the subsequent operational and administrative difficulties we had. In 1999 we spent approximately $1.3 billion on acquisitions of businesses and approximately $1.3 billion on capital expenditures. We funded these investing activities with cash flows from operations, net debt borrowings of approximately $259 million, other net financing activities of $167 million and proceeds from sales of assets of approximately $651 million. In 2000, we spent $231 million to acquire businesses, $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and $3.3 billion on net debt reductions. We financed these cash expenditures primarily with $2.1 billion of cash flows from operations and $2.6 billion of proceeds from our divestitures. A tax refund of approximately $200 million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in 2000. In 2001, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $2.4 billion. Favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of $59 million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and $64 million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities. Included in our investing activities was $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. 29 These expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of $212 million. In addition, we used $485 million for financing activities, which is comprised of $510 million of net debt reductions and $25 million of other financing activities, offset by proceeds of $50 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants, and other financing activities. The following summary of free cash flows has been prepared to highlight and facilitate understanding of the primary cash flow elements. It is not intended to replace the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, which were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Adjusted free cash flow in the table below, which is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, is defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider as unusual for the respective periods. The analysis of free cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 is as follows (in millions): YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 EBITDA(a)................................................... $ 3,034 $ 3,216 Interest paid...............................................

EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, but we have provided it here because we understand that such information is used by certain investors when analyzing our financial position and performance. On June 29, 2001, we replaced our prior bank credit facilities with a $750 million syndicated line of credit (the "Line of Credit") and a $1,750 million syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"). The Line of Credit requires annual renewal by the lender, and if it is not renewed, we have the option of converting the balance outstanding, if any, as of June 28, 2002 into a one year term loan. The Revolver matures in June 2006. As of December 31, 2001, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $1.6 billion, (of which approximately $1.5 billion are issued under our Revolver), that generally have terms allowing automatic renewal after a year. At December 31, 2001 and March 8, 2002, we had unused and available credit capacity under the bank credit facilities of approximately $994 million and $950 billion, respectively. 30 In February 2001, we issued $600 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due August 1, 2010. Interest is payable semi annually on February 1 and August 1. The net proceeds from the offering of the notes were approximately $593 million, after deducting discounts to the underwriters and expenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash from operations, to repay $600 million of senior notes that matured during the second quarter of 2001. In March 2001, we worked with local governmental authorities to refinance $339 million of fixed rate, tax exempt bonds maturing through 2008 with $326 million of variable rate, tax exempt bonds maturing through 2011 and $17 million of fixed rate bonds maturing through 2001. The new borrowings include $4 million of related financing costs. We recorded a net extraordinary loss of $1 million in the first quarter of 2001 for the remaining unamortized premium and issuance costs related to the retired debt. In November 2001, we issued $400 million of 6 1/2% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2008. Interest on the notes is payable semi annually on May 15 and November 15. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts to the underwriters and expenses, were approximately $396 million. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we repurchased $108 million of our 4% convertible subordinated notes due February 1, 2002. At the maturity date, we redeemed the remaining $427 million outstanding primarily using cash obtained from the November 2001 6 1/2% senior note issuance. On July 17, 1998, we issued $600 million of 6 1/8% mandatorily tendered senior notes, due July 15, 2011. The notes were subject to certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture, which allowed us to repurchase all of the outstanding notes on July 15, 2001. We used available cash on hand along with funds from the Line of Credit to repurchase the notes in July 2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately $1 million, net of taxes, for the retirement of this debt. In addition, we have $300 million of 6.625% senior notes due July 15, 2002, $285.7 million of 7.7% senior notes due October 1, 2002 and $350 million of 6.5% senior notes due December 15, 2002. We have classified these borrowings as long term at December 31, 2001 based upon our ability to use our Line of Credit and or Revolver, which are both considered long term facilities, to refinance these borrowings. We intend to pursue other sources of long term financing to refinance these borrowings; however, in the event other sources of long term financing are not available, we have the intent and ability to use our Line of Credit and or Revolver. At December 31, 2001, we had interest rate swap agreements with third parties with a notional amount of $1.8 billion. These agreements were established to manage the interest rate risk of our senior note obligations and at December 31, 2001, these interest rate swap agreements had a net negative fair value of $2 million. Under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives, the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements is recorded as either a risk management asset or liability with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the long term debt, which is the hedged instrument. Our reported long term debt does not include such an adjustment at December 31, 2000, since we adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as of January 1, 2001. In early October, we elected to terminate certain of our interest rate swap agreements and we received cash of $72 million (which is comprised of $64 million for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and $8 million for interest expense offsets previously accrued for settlements) from the counterparties. Under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives, the unamortized adjustment to long term debt for these terminated swaps of $60 million at December 31, 2001 remains in long term debt and will be amortized until the maturity of the related senior note obligation, the interest rate risk of which the hedge was established to manage. Approximately $16 million of this adjustment to long term debt will be amortized as an offset to interest expense in 2002. In November 2001, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits filed against us in July 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws. Under the settlement agreement, which is subject to court approval, we agreed to pay $457 million to the class. We expect our net cash outflow, after considering insurance, tax deductions and related settlement costs, to be approximately $230 to $240 million. The settlement will most likely be paid in the second half of 2002, with a minimal level of additional borrowing necessary to fund the settlement. 31 In February 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock buy back program. Under the program, we will buy back up to $1 billion of our common stock each year. The purchases will be made in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions using cash flow from operations. SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES On June 30, 2000, two limited liability companies ("LLCs") were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three of our waste to energy facilities. John Hancock Life Insurance Company ("Hancock") has 99.5% ownership in one of the LLCs. The second LLC is 99.5% collectively owned by Hancock and the CIT Group ("CIT"). We have a 0.5% interest in both LLCs. Hancock and CIT made an initial investment of approximately $167 million in the LLCs. Under the LLC agreements the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a written decision of all the members of the LLCs to dissolve the LLCs, (ii) December 31, 2063, (iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or (iv) the LLCs cease to own any interest in these waste to energy facilities. Additionally, income, losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital account balances until Hancock and CIT achieve targeted returns; thereafter, the amounts will be allocated 20% to Hancock and CIT and 80% to us. We do not expect Hancock and CIT to achieve the targeted returns in 2002. We account for the underlying leases as operating leases. The remaining aggregate lease commitments are $400 million related to these waste to energy facilities. Under the LLC agreements, if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases, we will be required to make capital contributions to the LLCs for the difference, if any, between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents. We are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the LLCs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and termination values under the LLC agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements. We believe that the occurrence of these circumstances is remote. We are the manager of the LLCs but there are significant limitations on the powers of the manager per the LLC agreements. Accordingly, we account for our interest in the LLCs under the equity method of accounting. These investments have a carrying value of approximately $1 million at both December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. If we were required to consolidate the LLCs, we would record approximately $425 million in assets, and $221 million of debt as of December 31, 2001. The remaining balance which would be recorded is primarily minority interest. During 2001 and 2000, the LLC received lease payments of $63 million and $35 million respectively, from the three waste to energy facilities and made distributions during the same periods to members of the LLCs of $13 million and $11 million, respectively. SEASONALITY AND INFLATION Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months, which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters. This is mostly because (i) the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because there is less construction activity and (ii) the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the Company operates tends to decrease during the winter months. We do not believe that inflation has, nor do we expect it to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. According to SFAS No. 142, goodwill that arises from purchases after June 30, 2001 cannot be amortized. In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires the continuation of the amortization of goodwill and all intangible assets through December 31, 2001, but provides that amortization of existing goodwill will cease on 32 January 1, 2002. Entities must use their current goodwill impairment approach through December 31, 2001, and begin to apply the new impairment approach on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires a two step impairment approach for goodwill. Companies must first determine whether goodwill is impaired and if so, they must value that impairment based on the amount by which the book value exceeds the estimated fair value. Companies have six months from the date they initially apply SFAS No. 142 to test goodwill for impairment and any impairment charge resulting from the initial application of the new rule must be classified as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Thereafter, goodwill should be tested for impairment annually and impairment losses should be presented in the operating section of the income statement unless they are associated with a discontinued operation. In those cases, any impairment losses will be included, net of tax, within the results of discontinued operations. During 2001, all of our business combinations were accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with our adoption of SFAS No. 141, we will continue to use the purchase method of accounting for our business combinations. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we have not amortized goodwill from any acquisitions that occurred after June 30, 2001. We have no intangible assets, other than goodwill, that will cease being amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142. We have recalculated our basic and diluted earnings per share for 2001, 2000 and 1999 excluding goodwill amortization, as follows (dollars in millions): YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Reported net income (loss).................................. $ 503 $ (97) $ (398) Add back: goodwill amortization, net of taxes............... 124 139 169 Adjusted net income (loss).................................. $ 627 $ 42 $ (229) BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $0.80 $(0.16) $(0.65) Goodwill amortization, net of taxes......................... 0.20 0.22 0.28 Adjusted net income (loss).................................. $1.00 $ 0.06 $(0.37) DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $0.80 $(0.16) $(0.65) Goodwill amortization, net of taxes......................... 0.20 0.22 0.28 Adjusted net income (loss).................................. $1.00 $ 0.06 $(0.37) The effect of adopting SFAS No. 141 will also require us to write off net negative goodwill of approximately $2 million, which will be recorded as a credit to cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit, which is defined as a companys operating segment or one level below the operating segment. For the purposes of applying SFAS No. 142, we have defined our reporting units to be our six individual NASW areas and our NASW recycling operations that are not included in any of our NASW areas. Although we currently expect no impairment of goodwill upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142 or at any time subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS No. 143"). SFAS No. 143 covers all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations. SFAS No. 143 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2003. Our management has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 33 In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144") which supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting method for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and extends the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. SFAS No. 144 also requires that an impairment loss be recognized for assets held for use when the carrying amount of an asset (group) is not recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset (group) is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (group), excluding interest charges. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset (group) must incorporate the entitys own assumptions about its use of the asset (group) and must factor in all available evidence. SFAS No. 144 is effective for us on January 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2001, the primary components within our operations held for sale were certain non solid waste operations, certain NASW operations and our surplus real estate portfolio. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 144, any held for sale operations that do not meet SFAS No. 144 criteria must be classified as held for use. We expect $14 million of held for sale assets to not meet SFAS No. 144 criteria. These assets will be reclassified to held for use in the first quarter of 2002. This reclassification will have no earnings impact. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and certain equity prices. From time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are simple agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on the notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2001, all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions, with the exception of two derivatives related to the pulp and paper commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the credit worthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their credit worthiness. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the handling of the Enron North America Corp. ("Enron") waste paper swap agreements. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our Companys market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we generally use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain floating rate debt obligations or to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations. An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at December 31, 2001 and 2000 by approximately $394 million and $403 million, respectively. This analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. Since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled paper products like old newspaper ("ONP") and old corrugated containers ("OCC"). We started entering into financial swaps in 1999 in an effort to mitigate the risk of recyclable paper price fluctuations. Under these financial swap agreements, we generally transfer a 34 floating market price for a fixed price for a fixed period of time. We and the counterparty agree to use a market index as an indicator of the market price during the term of the swap. At December 31, 2001, all, except two, of our waste paper swap agreements were with Enron. Due to Enrons financial situation, collectibility of the funds associated with these instruments is not probable at December 31, 2001 and therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair value. The derivatives with Enron were subsequently terminated in early 2002. The net fair value of two derivatives entered into for trading purposes was $7 thousand at December 31, 2001 and therefore not material. Equity Price Exposure. We are also subject to equity price exposure from our debt issues that are convertible into our own common stock. These debt issues had an aggregate carrying value of $458 million and $566 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. An instantaneous, ten percent decrease in our stock price on December 31, 2001 and 2000 would decrease the fair value to a third party holder of our convertible debt by approximately $1 million and $11 million, respectively. The exposure at December 31, 2001 has been substantially reduced due to the maturity and our payment of $427 million to redeem our 4% convertible subordinated notes due on February 1, 2002. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 35
