ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2002. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1 of this report, under the section "Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward Looking Statements." This discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty are related to our accounting for landfills, environmental liabilities and asset impairments, as described below. The discussion below details our accounting policies for landfills through December 31, 2002. As of January 1, 2003, our practice will change upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS No. 143"). See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Accounting for Landfills We utilize the life cycle method of accounting for landfill costs and the units of consumption method to amortize landfill construction costs and record closure and post closure obligations over the estimated remaining useful life of a landfill. Under this method we include future estimated construction costs, as well as costs incurred to date, in the amortization base. Additionally, we include probable expansion airspace that has yet to be permitted in the calculation of the total remaining useful life of the landfill. This accounting method requires us to make estimates and assumptions, as described below. Any changes in our estimates will impact our income from operations prospectively from the date the changes are made. Landfill Costs We assess the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity. This includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events. The total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs, landfill final capping costs, liner construction costs, operating construction costs, and capitalized interest costs. While the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty, we expect to incur $7.3 billion during the remaining operating lives of the landfills. The future costs will be capitalized as incurred and expensed over the useful lives of the landfills as airspace is consumed. Closure and Post Closure Costs The costs for closure and post closure obligations at landfills we own or operate are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. The estimates for landfill final closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in, where appropriate, inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain. While the precise amount of future closure and post closure costs cannot be determined with certainty, we estimate that the aggregate cost of landfill closure and post closure as of December 31, 2002 is approximately $2.6 billion. Available Airspace Our engineers determine the useful life at our landfills by estimating the available airspace. This is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate, based on height restrictions and other 19 factors, how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity. Expansion Airspace We also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable, using the following criteria: Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; At the time the expansion is added to the permitted site life, it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 91 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2002, 26 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Approximately two thirds of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because of legal or community issues that could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily due to permit application processes beyond the one year limit, which in most cases were due to state specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, final capping, and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. It is possible that any of our estimates or assumptions could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from actual results. In some cases we may be unsuccessful in obtaining an expansion permit or we may determine that an expansion permit that we previously thought was probable has become unlikely. To the extent that such estimates, or the assumptions used to make those estimates, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, the costs of the landfill, including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing, as described below, and lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher closure and post closure rates, and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. After determining the costs at our landfills, including closure and post closure costs, and the available and probable expansion airspace, we then determine the per ton rate that will be expensed. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace. We then divide our costs by that number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense. 20 The average landfill airspace amortization cost per ton for the 293 landfills operating at December 31, 2002 was $3.57 per ton as compared to $3.70 for the 302 landfills at December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net book value recorded for capitalized landfill site costs was $5.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. The average landfill closure and post closure expense, on a per ton basis, for the 293 landfills operating at December 31, 2002 was $0.23 per ton as compared to $0.24 for the 302 landfills at December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had recorded landfill closure and post closure liabilities of $655 million and $625 million, respectively. Environmental Remediation Liabilities Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a particular site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include legal defense, potentially responsible party ("PRP") investigation, settlement, and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, including sites listed on the EPAs National Priorities List ("NPL sites"). We consider whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. We then estimate the cost for the likely remedy, which is based on: Managements judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites; Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. These estimates are sometimes a range of reasonably possible outcomes. In those cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amounts that are the low ends of such ranges in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, ("SFAS No. 5") and its interpretations. Were we to use the high ends of such ranges, our potential liability would be approximately $220 million higher on a discounted basis in the aggregate than the estimate recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002. As used in this context, "reasonably possible" means we believe it is more than remote but less than likely. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had recorded liabilities of $343 million and $321 million, respectively, for the present value of remediation costs for our sites. Asset Impairments Our long lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down these assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an actual third party evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the fair value of an asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. 21 Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset; Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group; or A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill We assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. 22 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period to period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the various statement of operations line items.

Our revenues decreased from 2000 to 2001 primarily because we sold our international operations, most of our non solid waste businesses, and certain non integrated NASW operations. As shown below, NASW is our principal operation, which is comprised of six operating groups within North America, along with our other NASW services. Our "Other" operations consisted of waste management services in international markets and non solid waste services, all of which were divested as of March 31, 2002.

Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting, and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

We experienced negative internal growth in our NASW operations of 0.9%, or $92 million, which was substantially volume related. The negative volume decline of 1.6%, or $174 million, compared to 2001 is largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations, with the exception of the southern portion of the United States, where we realized slight volume increases. We also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the United States. We believe that the overall decreased volumes, particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services, were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition. However, offsetting these declines were increases in volumes related to our recycling operations of $19 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Offsetting the decrease in revenue due to volume declines were price related revenue increases of $82 million, or 0.7%, in 2002 as compared to 2001. Of this increase, $69 million, or 0.6%, is attributable to the significant increase in commodity prices of OCC and ONP. OCC prices increased to an average price of $74 per ton for 2002 as compared to an average price of $49 per ton for 2001. Reduced electricity rates in California and reduced fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change by $59 million, or 0.5% . Revenue change due to price in our base business reflected an increase of $72 million, or 0.6%, was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations. These price related revenue increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations. We also experienced increases in revenue of $82 million in 2002 from acquisitions consummated during 2002 and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in 2001. Offsetting this was a decrease in revenue of $18 million due to divestitures and the effect of foreign currency fluctuations related to the Canadian dollar. NASW revenues decreased from 2000 to 2001 by $260 million due primarily to divestitures of our non integrated NASW operations during 2000. We also experienced a reduction of revenue due to volume of $86 million, largely attributable to the overall slowing of the North American economy, the termination of unprofitable accounts and the impact of our policy change for third party brokers, which required more stringent contract requirements, resulting in the loss of some brokered waste. NASW operating revenues also declined because of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate of the Canadian dollar, which reduced revenues by $20 million. In addition, revenue changes due to price reflected a decline of $8 million due to combined revenue declines of $171 million from recycling commodities and electricity sales by IPPs, substantially offset by increased revenues due to price in the base business of $162 million. Offsetting these revenue declines were the acquisition of certain NASW operations in 2001 and the year over year effect of acquisitions of NASW operations in 2000. 26 OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION SHOWN BELOW) Our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits, fuel, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations, and accruals for future landfill closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation. Certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed, and include acquisition, engineering, upgrading, construction, capitalized interest, and permitting costs. Additionally, we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial, defense and tort claim costs. Such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses. Our operating costs and expenses increased 1.2% in 2002 as compared to 2001, and decreased 11.6% in 2001 as compared to 2000. As a percentage of operating revenues, operating costs and expenses decreased from 60.4% in 2000 to 58.9% in 2001 and increased to 60.5% in 2002. The most significant factor causing the change in operating expenses between 2002 and 2001 was the offset to operating costs and expenses of approximately $105 million recorded in 2001 for the recovery of claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses. Operating expenses were also higher in 2002 as compared to 2001 because of (i) increases in salary, wages and employee benefit costs, (ii) higher workers compensation costs, (iii) increases in disposal and subcontractor costs and (iv) higher costs associated with recycling commodities. The headcount reductions associated with our March 2002 reorganization allowed us to realize significant cost reductions. However, the reorganization also resulted in a re characterization of certain costs that were reported as selling, general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in certain roles and responsibilities. This change, along with additional costs associated with annual merit increases, more than offset the decrease in operating expenses as a result of the headcount reductions. Disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the disposal of waste in Pennsylvania, which were partially offset by decreases in disposal costs due to declines in volumes in 2002 as compared with 2001. Subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors for certain of our national account customers in areas where services are not provided by us and increased use of third party transportation of waste to disposal facilities. The increased costs associated with recycling commodities were due primarily to an increase in market prices paid for OCC and ONP, which resulted in increased rebates paid to customers. Offsetting these increases was the effect of divestitures of our international operations in 2001 and the non solid waste operations in the first quarter of 2002. The divestitures decreased operating expenses by approximately $115 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Also offsetting the increased costs and expenses in 2002 as compared with 2001 were lower fuel costs, including fuel used to operate our IPPs, reduced maintenance costs and lower construction services at certain of our waste to energy facilities that we operate but do not own. The year to year decline in operating costs and expenses between 2000 and 2001 was primarily caused by the sales of our international, non solid waste and non integrated NASW operations. These sales occurred throughout 2000 and into 2001. Adding to the decrease was the effect of the volume declines in 2001 as compared to 2000, as described in the discussion of NASW operating revenues. Additionally, in 2000 we initiated cost saving improvements in our procurement practices and began to develop more standardized operating procedures. Our improvements continued in 2001 and caused further decreases in operating costs and expenses into 2001. In 2001 we implemented other cost saving initiatives, such as preventative maintenance programs that created an overall reduction in repair and maintenance costs. Finally, in 2001 we aggressively pursued our claims against insurers for reimbursement of environmental expenses, recovering approximately $105 million in 2001 as compared to $2 million in 2000, which were recorded as an offset to operating costs and expenses. If we excluded the insurance recoveries, operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues would have been 59.8% in 2001. 27 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Our selling, general and administrative expenses include management salaries, clerical and administrative costs, marketing costs, professional services, facility rentals, provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs, as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service. Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $93 million, or 5.7%, in 2002 as compared to 2001, and decreased $116 million, or 6.7%, in 2001 compared to 2000. As a percentage of operating revenues, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 13.7% for 2002, 14.3% for 2001 and 13.9% for 2000. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to managements focus on reducing spending related to professional fees, travel and entertainment, and other administrative costs. Additionally, expenses decreased due to headcount reductions and the re characterization of certain expenses as costs of operations rather than selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the March 2002 restructuring. Finally, costs further decreased due to the divestitures of non solid waste and international operations in 2001 and in early 2002. The reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses were offset partially by increased costs associated with both litigation settlements and expense, higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy, workers compensation costs, and property related costs such as property taxes, maintenance and security. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues decreased in 2002 as compared with 2001 because of these same factors, since operating revenues remained essentially flat between the two periods. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues from 2000 to 2001 is due to the decrease in NASW revenues in the corresponding periods as discussed above. However, the decrease in actual selling, general and administrative expenses from 2001 as compared to 2000 is due mostly to the divestitures that we completed throughout 2000. In addition, as discussed below, we had significant costs in 2000 related to accounting and process improvement initiatives. These costs were not as significant in 2001, as we were able to stabilize our accounting systems and substantially complete our process improvement initiatives in the second half of 2000. Offsetting these decreases were costs related to corporate staffing increases, which began primarily in 2000 and continued in 2001. In 2000, we incurred significant costs for our process improvement initiatives and accounting assistance. These costs were mainly in the first half of 2000 because, by the second half of 2000, we had stabilized our accounting systems and completed our process improvement initiatives, which significantly reduced our ongoing need for these services. In 2000, we incurred approximately $196 million for professional accounting and process improvement consulting services and consulting services related to the implementation of new enterprise information systems. We also incurred approximately $51 million related to our divestitures, improvements to our billing systems and verification of our customer base, and legal fees related to certain stockholder litigation and other SEC matters. However, in 2000 we were successful in collecting certain accounts that were reserved for in 1999, favorably impacting our provision for bad debt in 2000. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life other than goodwill on a straight line basis, generally 3 to 7 years, or over the definitive terms of the related agreements; (ii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from 3 to 50 years; and (iii) amortization of landfill costs on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site. In 2001 and 2000, depreciation and amortization expense also included the amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis over a period of 40 years or less, commencing on the dates of the respective acquisition. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 10.9% in 2002 as compared to 2001 and decreased 4.1% in 2001 as compared to 2000. As a percentage of operating revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 11.0% in 2002, 12.1% in 2001 and 11.4% in 2000. 28 The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 is primarily attributable to our adoption of SFAS No. 142, which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on January 1, 2002. Goodwill amortization for 2001 was $156 million, or 1.4% of operating revenues. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in 2001, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 0.3% from 2001 compared to 2002. The decrease in depreciation and amortization in 2001 is attributable to the amortization expense of goodwill on operations that were divested throughout 2000, more cost effective use of our landfill assets in 2001 and a temporary increase in fully depreciated trucks and other equipment associated with delays in receiving new equipment in the first half of 2001. The following schedule reflects the 2001 and 2000 adjusted net income (excluding goodwill and negative goodwill amortization) as compared to the results of operations for December 31, 2002 (in millions, except per share amounts). YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 Reported net income (loss).................................. $ 822 $ 503 $ (97) Add back: goodwill amortization, net of taxes............... 124 139 Adjusted net income......................................... $ 822 $ 627 $ 42 BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $1.34 $0.80 $(0.16) Goodwill amortization, net of taxes......................... 0.20 0.22 Adjusted net income......................................... $1.34 $1.00 $ 0.06 DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $1.33 $0.80 $(0.16) Goodwill amortization, net of taxes......................... 0.20 0.22 Adjusted net income......................................... $1.33 $1.00 $ 0.06 RESTRUCTURING In 2002, we adopted and implemented a new organizational structure to better align collection, transport, recycling and disposal resources within market areas. We believe the new structure will yield a number of benefits, including clearer accountability and responsibility for business performance and profitability in specific markets; simplification of structure; cost savings through consolidation of duplicate administrative and other support functions; improved utilization of operating assets; and better customer responsiveness. In March 2002 all of our operations, other than WTI and CWS, were restructured to reduce the number of field layers of management from four to three and the number of field layers that have administrative staff from four to two. Under the new structure, our approximately 1,200 operating sites, including waste collection depots, transfer stations, landfills and recycling facilities, were restructured into approximately 82 newly established Market Areas. These Market Areas all report to one of four Groups that divide the United States geographically into the Eastern, Midwest, Southern and Western operations, and which were formerly known as our "Areas." CWS, which was restructured into ten newly established Market Areas in July 2002, and WTI were the fifth and sixth Areas under our previous structure continue as the fifth and sixth Groups under the new structure. We recorded $38 million of pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new organizational structure. These charges include $36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and $2 related to abandoned operating lease agreements. 29 Under the new structure approximately 1,900 field level administrative and operational positions have been eliminated. Our obligation for severance payments will continue into 2003. As of December 31, 2002, payments of $33 million for employee severance and benefits and for abandoned leases had been recorded against the restructuring liability that was previously established. ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND UNUSUAL ITEMS In 2002, the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to (i) our receipt of approximately $11 million related to a non revenue producing asset written down as an asset impairment in 1998, (ii) net gains of approximately $8 million on divestitures during the year and (iii) reductions to legal and loss contract reserves of approximately $8 million and $7 million, respectively, that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items. In 2001, the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of $374 million, which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in July 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, provides for our payment to the class of $457 million, and we believe the payment, which is expected to be made in 2003, will result in a net cash outflow of approximately $230 to $240 million after considering insurance, tax deductions and related settlement costs. In addition, we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately $15 million related to our international operations along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in Mexican solid waste operations of approximately $28 million. Offsetting these expenses was a net gain of $24 million (comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of $109 million and a held for use impairment of $85 million) from our decision during the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our IPPs, and the reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of our IPPs from held for sale to held for use. Also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 are reversals of certain loss contract reserves of $13 million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements. In 2000, these costs were primarily due to our sale of our international operations and the termination of WM Holdings defined benefit pension plan, which are more fully described in Notes 16 and 13, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. INTEREST EXPENSE Our interest expense decreased consistently each year from 2000 to 2002. The primary factor for the decrease in interest expense in 2002 is our interest rate derivative contracts, which are utilized to manage our interest rate exposure and the general decline in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by $86 million for 2002 and contributed to the decrease by $39 million in 2001. The remaining decrease in interest expense in 2001 is primarily due to the pay down of debt with proceeds from our divestitures and cash flows from operations. In 2002, the refinancing of debt instruments at lower interest rates created additional interest expense savings. Additionally, to further reduce interest expense we have increased our utilization of tax exempt bond financing over the past two years as a lower cost source of funding. OTHER INCOME We experienced an increase in other income in 2002 as compared to prior years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment. In 2002, a company in which we held an approximately 17% interest was acquired by another entity. We held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition. The proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. 30 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES We recorded a provision for income taxes of $424 million, $284 million and $418 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 34.0%, 36.1% and 130.2% for each of the three years, respectively. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits. In addition, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefited capital loss that arose from a divestiture. A tax benefit of approximately $31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carry back of losses by our Dutch subsidiary. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2001 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, non deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses, the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested, offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits. Additionally, in 2001 scheduled Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of $42 million, which was offset in part by a tax expense of $24 million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in Canada. The 130.2% effective tax rate in 2000 is significantly higher than the federal statutory rate due to state and local income taxes, non deductible costs relating to acquired intangibles, write down of investments in subsidiaries and minority interest, sales of foreign subsidiaries and the cost associated with remitting earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested, offset in part by non conventional tax credits. EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS During the first quarter of 2002, we refinanced approximately $49 million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds maturing in 2011 with variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing in 2022. As a result, we incurred prepayment penalties and other fees for a total charge, net of tax benefit, of approximately $1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we elected to repay approximately $145 million of our senior debt issuances prior to their maturity dates. In connection with these repayments, we recognized an extraordinary charge of approximately $2 million, net of tax benefit, for the prepayment penalties and other costs related to the retired debt. In the first quarter of 2001, we worked with local governmental authorities to refinance $339 million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds maturing through 2008 with $326 million of variable rate tax exempt bonds maturing through 2011 and $17 million of fixed rate bonds that matured later in 2001. We recorded a net extraordinary loss of $1 million for the remaining unamortized premium and issuance costs related to the retired debt. On July 17, 1998, we issued $600 million of 6 1/8% mandatorily tendered senior notes, due July 15, 2011. The notes were subject to certain mandatory tender features as described in the indenture, which allowed us to purchase all of the outstanding notes on July 15, 2001. We used available cash on hand along with funds from our credit facility to purchase the notes in July 2001. During the third quarter of 2001, we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately $1 million, net of taxes, for the retirement of this debt. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE As a result of adopting SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations, ("SFAS No. 141") on January 1, 2002, we were required to write off amounts of negative goodwill that had been recorded in prior periods through purchase accounting. The aggregate amount of negative goodwill was $2 million and was recorded as a credit to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. 31 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ("SFAS No. 133"), became effective for us as of January 1, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 133, resulted in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2001. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year........ $ 264 $ 730 $ 94 Cash provided by operating activities................... $ 2,153 $ 2,355 $ 2,125 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities......... $ (962) $(1,232) $ 1,072 Cash used in financing activities....................... $(1,658) $ (485) $(3,279) Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash balances decreased $466 million from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures, our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates, which exceeded our existing cash balances and our $2.2 billion of operating cash flow. In 2002, cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by cash received of $166 million from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities, offset by cash paid of $66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances. Included in our investing activities was cash paid of $1.3 billion for capital expenditures and $162 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds of $487 million from other investing activities, primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds. Included in our financing activities was cash paid of $982 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition we paid $697 million for net debt reductions and received $27 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants. In 2001, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $2.4 billion. Favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of $59 million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and $64 million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities. Included in our investing activities was $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of $212 million. In addition, we used $485 million for financing activities, which is comprised of $510 million of net debt reductions and $25 million of other financing activities, offset by proceeds of $50 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants, and other financing activities. In 2000, we spent $231 million to acquire businesses, $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and $3.3 billion on net debt reductions. We financed these cash expenditures primarily with $2.1 billion of cash flows from operations and $2.6 billion of proceeds from our divestitures. A tax refund of approximately $200 million and our improvements in accounts receivable average days sale outstanding favorably impacted cash flows from operations in 2000. We operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and 32 financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows; our asset base; and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. In addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations, we have capital requirements for (i) capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites, as well as new trucks and equipment for collection and other operations, (ii) refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and (iii) business acquisitions. For 2003, we currently expect to spend approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for capital expenditures. In February 2002 we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion in annual repurchases for each of 2002, 2003 and 2004, to be implemented at managements discretion. We expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions. The following is a summary of 2002 activity for our stock repurchase program (in millions, except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars). AGREEMENT COMMON STOCK NET COMMON PURCHASE SETTLEMENT STOCK TRANSACTION TYPE INITIATING DATE SETTLEMENT DATE SHARES PRICE PRICE RECEIVED/(PAID) REPURCHASES Private Accelerated Purchase(a)........

N/A N/A 25,594 $23.01 $28.19 658 N/A 658 38,250 $1,000 $982 (a) We accounted for the initial payment as a purchase of treasury stock and classified the future settlement with the counterparty as an equity instrument because we had the option under the agreement to settle our obligation, if any, in shares of our common stock. (b) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $18 million less than the approximately $300 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the counterparty paid us this difference of approximately $18 million at the end of the valuation period, which occurred during the third quarter of 2002, to settle the agreement. We accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. (c) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $3 million less than the approximately $42 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the counterparty will pay us the difference of approximately $3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement. (d) We engaged in open market purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to law and our insider trading policy. 33 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 THEREAFTER TOTAL Debt payments, excluding interest............ $231 $ 737 $ 900 $494 $474 $5,457 $ 8,293 Expected aggregate environmental liabilities (based on current cost)(a)................. 114 69 68 56 46 2,639 2,992 Non cancellable rental obligations........... 149 145 140 133 111 502 1,180 Unconditional purchase obligations(b)........ 338 67 39 39 19 267 769 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2002...................... $832 $1,018 $1,147 $722 $650 $8,865 $13,234 (a) Environmental liabilities include final closure, post closure and environmental remediation costs. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. (b) See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies, including guarantee arrangements, that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Additionally, we expect a net cash outflow, after considering insurance, tax deductions and related settlement costs, of approximately $230 to $240 million in 2003 for settlement of our securities class action lawsuit. The settlement fund began to accrue interest, at the Federal Funds rate, during the second quarter of 2002, although payment will not become due until the judgment is final, which we expect to occur in 2003. To meet our capital needs and contractual obligations, as described above, our strategy is to utilize cash flows from operations. We also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and, when appropriate, will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock. As of December 31, 2002, we had a $650 million syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Three Year Revolver"), and a $1.75 billion syndicated revolving credit facility (the "Five Year Revolver"). The Three Year Revolver matures in June 2005 and the Five Year Revolver matures in June 2006. As of December 31, 2002, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.75 billion (of which approximately $1.63 billion are issued under the revolving credit facilities) that generally have terms allowing automatic renewal after a year. At December 31, 2002, no balances were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately $770 million. As of December 31, 2002, the financial covenants we are required to maintain under our credit facilities include (i) an interest coverage ratio; (ii) total debt to EBITDA and; (iii) minimum net worth, all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the covenants. The interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (A) our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes ("EBIT") for the four fiscal quarters then ending to (B) consolidated total interest expense for such period to be less than 2.5 to 1 for quarters ending on or before December 31, 2002 and 3 to 1 thereafter. The total debt to EBITDA covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter, we will not permit the ratio of (A) all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to (B) EBIT plus depreciation and amortization expense ("EBITDA") for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed 3 to 1. Our minimum net worth covenant requires that we will not allow the sum of stockholders equity to be less than $3.5 billion plus 75% of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter, beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, we are in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities and all other debt instruments. In January 2003, our total debt to EBITDA covenant was amended to not permit that ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1 rather than 3 to 1. In November 2002, we privately placed $400 million of 6 3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2012. Interest on the notes is due on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $396 million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses. We used these proceeds primarily to pay the $350 million of 6.5% senior notes that came due December 15, 2002. 34 In May 2002, we privately placed $500 million of 7 3/4% senior unsecured notes due 2032. Interest on the notes is due on November 15 and May 15 of each year. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $498 million, after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses. We used these proceeds to pay the $300 million of 6.625% senior notes that matured on July 15, 2002 and a portion of the $285.7 million of 7.7% senior notes that matured on October 1, 2002. Additionally, we have issued industrial revenue bonds primarily for the construction of various facilities. Proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities. Accordingly, these amounts are reported as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid. At December 31, 2002, approximately $412 million of cash was held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities. We have $434 million of 6.375% senior notes due December 1, 2003. We also have $450 million of 7.1% senior notes due August 1, 2026 that are subject to early redemption on August 1, 2003 at the option of the holders. We have classified approximately $770 million of these borrowings as long term at December 31, 2002 based upon our ability to use our revolving credit facilities, which are both long term, to refinance these borrowings at their respective maturity or repayment date. We intend to pursue other sources of long term financing to refinance the borrowings; however, in the event other sources of long term financing are not available, we intend to use our revolving credit facilities. We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt, which is approximately 70% fixed and 30% floating at December 31, 2002. In addition, we periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the then current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances. During 2002, we entered into hedging agreements to secure the underlying treasury rates in anticipation of our 2002 senior note issuances. We settled with the counterparties for approximately $66 million, which was paid concurrently with related 2002 senior note issuances discussed above. In 2002, we elected to terminate several interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $2.95 billion prior to the scheduled maturities and received cash of approximately $200 million (which is comprised of $166 million for the fair value of the swaps that were terminated and $34 million of accrued but unpaid interest receivable) from the counterparties to the interest rate swaps. Under the hedge method of accounting for these types of derivatives, the unamortized adjustment to long term debt for the terminated swaps remains classified as long term debt. The proceeds received from the termination of the interest rate swap agreements have been classified as a change in other assets or other liabilities within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES On June 30, 2000, two limited liability companies ("LLCs") were established to purchase interests in existing leveraged lease financings at three waste to energy facilities that we operate under an agreement with the owner. John Hancock Life Insurance Company ("Hancock") has a 99.5% ownership in one of the LLCs, the second LLC is 99.5% collectively owned by Hancock and the CIT Group ("CIT") and we own the remaining 0.5% interest in each. Hancock and CIT made an initial investment of approximately $167 million in the LLCs. The LLCs used these proceeds to purchase the three waste to energy facilities that we operate and assumed the sellers indebtedness related to these facilities. Under the LLC agreements, the LLCs shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a written decision of all the members of the LLCs to dissolve, (ii) December 31, 2063, (iii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or (iv) the LLCs ceasing to own any interest in these waste to energy facilities. Income, losses and cash flows are allocated to the members based on their initial capital account balances until Hancock and CIT achieve targeted returns; thereafter, the amounts will be allocated 20% to Hancock and CIT and 80% to us. We do not expect Hancock and CIT to achieve the targeted returns in 2003 or at any time during the initial base term of the lease. We account for the underlying leases as operating leases. We are required under certain circumstances to make capital contributions to the LLCs in the amount of the difference between the stipulated loss amounts and termination values under the LLC 35 agreements to the extent they are different from the underlying lease agreements. We believe that the likelihood of the occurrence of these circumstances is remote. During 2002, we had aggregate lease payments of approximately $62 million. Under the LLC agreements, if we exercise certain renewal options under the leases, we will be required to make capital contributions to the LLCs for the difference, if any, between fair market rents and the scheduled renewal rents. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining aggregate lease commitments related to these waste to energy facilities are $526 million, which includes $158 million in required capital contributions to the LLC for the amount of the difference between bargain renewals and the fair value of the lease. These minimum lease payments are included in the table of non cancelable rental obligations as discussed in Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements. We are the manager of the LLCs but there are significant limitations on the powers of the manager under the LLC agreements. Accordingly, we account for our interest in the LLCs under the equity method of accounting. These investments had a carrying value of approximately $1 million at both December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. If we were required to consolidate the LLCs, we would record approximately $414 million in assets, and $208 million of debt as of December 31, 2002. The remaining balance that would be recorded would primarily be minority interest. There would be no material net impact to our results of operations if we consolidated the LLCs instead of accounting for them under the equity method. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS We account for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as amended, under which no compensation cost for stock options is recognized when granted with an exercise price equal to fair value. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123"), establishes accounting and annual disclosure requirements for options granted after 1994 using a fair value based method of accounting. As of December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, we had approximately 44.5 million, 41.5 million and 40.3 million stock options and warrants outstanding, respectively. The weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 as determined under SFAS No. 123 was $12.16, $10.83 and $6.78, respectively. The fair value of each common stock option granted to employees or directors during 2002, 2001 and 2000 is estimated utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model. Black Scholes is a formula that calculates an estimated value of stock options based on appreciation and interest rate assumptions and therefore, the fair value calculation of a stock option using Black Scholes is not necessarily indicative of the actual value of a stock option. The following weighted average assumptions were used: dividend yield of 0%, risk free interest rates which vary for each grant and range from 2.91% to 6.19%, expected life of four to seven years for all grants, and stock price volatility primarily ranging from 23.7% to 50.4%. The following schedule reflects the impact on net income and earnings per common share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock based employee compensation (in millions, except per share amounts). YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 2001 2000 Reported net income (loss).................................. $ 822 $ 503 $ (97) Less: compensation expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax..... 85 83 75 Pro forma net income (loss)................................. $ 737 $ 420 $ (172) BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $1.34 $0.80 $(0.16) Less: compensation expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax..... 0.14 0.13 0.12 Pro forma net income (loss)................................. $1.20 $0.67 $(0.28) DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: Reported net income (loss).................................. $1.33 $0.80 $(0.16) Less: compensation expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax..... 0.14 0.13 0.12 Pro forma net income (loss)................................. $1.19 $0.67 $(0.28) 36 SEASONALITY AND INFLATION Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months, which corresponds with our first and fourth quarters. This is mostly because (i) the volume of construction and demolition waste is lower in the winter because there is less construction activity and (ii) the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate tends to decrease during the winter months. We do not believe that inflation has, nor do we expect it to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations in the near future. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS In January 2003, we announced that we had formed a new recycling entity, Recycle America Alliance, L.L.C. ("RAA"), a wholly owned subsidiary, in an effort to optimize the capacity and improve the profitability of our recycling operations. In connection with the formation of RAA, we transferred substantially all recycling assets and businesses of our other subsidiaries to RAA. RAAs strategy includes combining its assets and operations with a number of key processors and marketers. On January 10, 2003, the Peltz Group, the largest privately held recycler in the United States, contributed all of its assets to RAA in exchange for an initial payment by RAA of approximately $58 million in cash and the issuance of approximately 9% of the equity interest in RAA. In February 2003, we announced that we will implement further restructuring to reorganize our operations into a smaller number of Market Areas in an effort to reduce overhead costs. As part of the restructuring, there will be a net workforce reduction of about 700 employees and 270 contract workers. We anticipate a charge of approximately $23 million for this restructuring. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND OTHER ACCOUNTING CHANGES NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SFAS No. 143 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 143. SFAS No. 143 applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires amounts initially recognized as an asset retirement obligation to be measured at fair value. The recognized asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the asset and is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. SFAS No. 143, which will primarily impact the accounting for our landfill operations, does not change the basic landfill accounting followed historically by us along with others in the waste industry. In general, the waste industry has recognized expenses associated with both amortization of capitalized costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice, referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry, will continue to be followed upon adoption of SFAS No. 143, except as discussed below. Under the new rules, costs associated with future final capping activities that occur during the operating life of a landfill, which are currently recognized on an undiscounted basis over the operating life of the landfill as airspace is consumed, will be accounted for as an asset retirement obligation, on a discounted basis. We expect to recognize landfill retirement obligations that relate to closure and post closure activities over the operating life of a landfill as landfill airspace is consumed and the obligation is incurred. We expect to recognize our final capping obligations on a discrete basis for each expected future final capping event over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event is expected to cover. These obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value will be measured on a present value basis, using a credit adjusted, risk free rate, initially 7.25%, which is higher than the risk free rate previously used for discounting closure and post closure obligations. Interest will be accreted on all landfill retirement obligations using the effective interest method. Landfill retirement costs arising from closure and post closure obligations, which will be capitalized as part of the landfill asset, will be amortized using our existing landfill accounting practices. 37 Landfill retirement costs arising from final capping obligations, which will also be capitalized as part of the landfill asset, will be amortized on a units of consumption basis over the number of tons of waste that each final capping event covers. The table below reflects the significant changes between our current landfill accounting practices and the requirements of SFAS No. 143.

We expect that the impact of adopting SFAS No. 143 in 2003 will decrease earnings per share from our previous method by approximately $0.08 per diluted share. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have no net effect on our cash flow. SFAS No. 145 In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections ("SFAS No. 145"). SFAS No. 145 requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 ("Opinion No. 30"). Applying the provisions of Opinion No. 30 will distinguish transactions that are part of an entitys recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2003. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145, we will reclassify certain items in our prior period statements of operations to conform to the presentation required by SFAS No. 145. Under SFAS No. 145, we will report gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt in pre tax earnings rather than in extraordinary items. SFAS No. 146 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS No. 146"). SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, such as restructurings, involuntarily terminating employees, and consolidating facilities initiated after December 31, 2002. The implementation of SFAS No. 146 will not require the restatement of previously issued financial statements. Implementation of the pronouncement will therefore have no impact on our current year financial statements. We will apply SFAS No. 146 requirements to our 2003 restructuring. See Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 39 FIN 45 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45"). It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for us on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. We will record the fair value of future material guarantees, if any. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for current disclosure requirements related to our guarantee arrangements. FIN 46 In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries. A primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses or residual benefits. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to existing variable interest entities in the periods beginning after June 15, 2003. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our existing variable interests. We have yet to determine the impact that the adoption of FIN 46 will have on our consolidated financial statements. OTHER ACCOUNTING CHANGES Repairs and Maintenance Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures at our waste to energy facilities and IPPs. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. In the first quarter of 2003, we expect to record approximately $30 million, net of taxes, as a credit to cumulative effect of an accounting change. Loss Contract Accrual Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses for contracts that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. In the first quarter of 2003, we expect to record approximately $30 million, net of taxes, as a credit to cumulative effect of an accounting change. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, certain commodity prices and certain equity prices. From time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2002, all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions, with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding terminated fiber agreements with Enron North America Corp. ("Enron"). We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from 40 our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations. An instantaneous, one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at December 31, 2002 and 2001 by approximately $482 million and $394 million, respectively. This analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. Since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. An instantaneous ten percent decrease in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2002 would have no material impact to the Company. We had no foreign currency derivatives at December 31, 2001. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled waste paper products such as ONP and OCC from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under these swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. We also enter into fiber swap agreements for trading purposes with the objective of generating profits from changes in market prices of waste paper and other paper products. We record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits. An instantaneous ten percent increase in OCC and ONP prices at December 31, 2002 would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately $11.2 million. This analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged. An instantaneous ten percent increase in prices at December 31, 2002 on our derivatives entered into for trading purposes would have no material impact on us. At December 31, 2001, all, except two, of our fiber agreements were with Enron. Due to Enrons financial situation, collectibility of the funds associated with these instruments was not probable at December 31, 2001 and therefore these instruments were estimated to have no fair value. The derivatives with Enron were subsequently terminated in early 2002. The net fair value of the two derivatives with counterparties other than Enron at December 31, 2001 was not material. See Notes 2, 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 41
