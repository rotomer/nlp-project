Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2003. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1 of this report, under the section Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward Looking Statements. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We are in an industry that provides an essential service needed by nearly every business and person. Our success depends on our ability to focus on our core business, operational excellence and financial strength and flexibility. In 2003, we continued to build financial strength by meeting our goal of producing adjusted free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion. Free cash flow is not a financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, we include it in our communications to stockholders because we believe that the amount of cash we produce from our non financing activities that is available to us for such things as acquisitions, share repurchases, debt reductions and dividends is important in evaluating our performance, including meeting our goal of providing value to our stockholders. We compute free cash flow by taking the net cash that was provided by our operating activities, subtracting capital expenditures and adding proceeds from our divestitures and other sales of assets. Free cash flow is then adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider unusual for the year. In 2003, the net cash provided by our operating activities was approximately $1.9 billion. We spent approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures. After adding back the proceeds we received of approximately $74 million from divestitures of businesses and other asset sales, our free cash flow was approximately $800 million. We adjusted this amount to take into consideration the approximately $223 million net cash impact for the settlement of our stockholder class action settlement, giving us approximately $1.02 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2003. To help us improve our business and operations, we have developed branded initiatives like WasteRoute and Service Machine, as well as other initiatives to improve safety, procurement, operations, cost control and sales. Although we made significant progress in 2003, we have much more to do in 2004 and beyond and our Company is now better positioned to reap the benefits of the programs we have put in place. An integral part of our focus has been on internal, or organic, growth. In 2003, internal revenue growth was 0.9%, or $103 million, as compared to 2002. The biggest driver in this increase was price, and we continue to work on our pricing program. However, volumes declined as compared to the prior year, due mostly to the loss of a large contract with the City of Chicago early in the year, offsetting some of our pricing achievement. We believe some of our performance in 2003 was due to general economic factors, although increased competition also played a part. We cannot control the economy, but we can compete, and therefore we focused on customer churn rates and sales force effectiveness. In 2003, we continued to hold our customer churn rate below 10%, which we see as a benchmark for success, and we maintained the same amount of new sales dollars in 2003 as compared to the prior year, even with a smaller sales force. Moreover, it is generally believed that the waste industry lags the economy by six to nine months. Consequently, our sales force effectiveness program, including our pricing strategy, should result in greater internal revenue growth if the recent economic recovery continues in 2004 and beyond. Finally, we also actively pursue strategic acquisitions in our NASW operations. Through acquisitions, we increased our 2003 revenue by $334 million. To achieve our goal of operational excellence, we have been working hard to seek operational and cost efficiencies. In 2003, we further streamlined our operating infrastructure, which resulted in the elimination of about 1,300 employee positions and 470 contract workers. For 2003, we saw cost savings from the reorganization in our selling, general and administrative costs, while at the same time growing our total revenues by 4%. The reorganization changed the roles of our people in the field so that our operating sites are responsible for delivering service and operational excellence and the market areas are responsible for implementing strategy, improving performance and ensuring profitability in their markets. 20 When measured on an initiative by initiative basis, which is the way we measure our goals internally, we believe that our efforts on cost reductions and efficiency programs are paying off. We have continued to decrease the maintenance cost per driver hour, which is the primary performance metric for fleet maintenance. We also are focusing on container maintenance, and have created improvement plans and conducted test pilots to see where we can reduce costs. Additionally, our focus on our safety program resulted in another year over year decrease in recordable injuries and vehicle accidents, although our per claim costs continued to rise, offsetting the financial benefit of the reduced number of claims. Finally, our WasteRoute initiative reduced the number of routes we have, and now we are looking for opportunities to further save on route related costs. Our operating costs and expenses for 2003 do not show the level of improvement we believe we have made in our initiatives to cut overall costs. This is due to an increase in those costs as a result of a recharacterization of expenses that had previously been classified as selling, general and administrative costs, increased costs of goods sold due to acquisitions of recycling businesses, the implementation of SFAS No. 143, increased disposal costs at third party facilities and increased labor rates. However, we believe that we have the momentum necessary to continue all of our efforts and make progress in 2004. We also believe that we have our organizational structure and field based management at the appropriate size for the current economy as well as for business opportunities from an expanding economy. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments, as described below. Landfills Effective January 1, 2003, our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure, as well as landfill final capping, changed as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Through December 31, 2002, the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with (i) amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and (ii) future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice, referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry, continues to be followed, with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill, as was the practice prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs We estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity. This includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events. The total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs, landfill liner construction costs, operating construction costs, and capitalized interest costs. 21 Final Capping Costs We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. They then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. Closure and Post Closure Costs We base our estimates for closure and post closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain. Available Airspace Our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills. This is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate, based on height restrictions and other factors, how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity. Expansion Airspace We also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable, using the following criteria: Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; It is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 84 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2003, 25 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Approximately two thirds of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because legal, community, or other issues could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements, which in many cases were due to state specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, final capping, and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs at our landfills, including final capping costs and closure and post closure costs, and the available and probable expansion airspace relating to such costs, we then determine the per ton 22 rates that will be expensed. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. It is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, the costs of the landfill, including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing, as described below. Lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher closure and post closure rates, and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. Additionally, if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include potentially responsible party (PRP) investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Managements judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites; Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments Our long lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an actual third party evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. 23 Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset; Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group; or A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills There are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill We assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. 24 Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period to period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the various statement of operations line items.

As shown below, North American Solid Waste, or NASW, is our principal operation, and is comprised of seven operating Groups within North America, along with our Other NASW services. The operations shown as Other in the table below consisted of international waste management services and non solid waste services, all of which were divested as of March 31, 2002.

Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our five geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of NASW operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Collection $ 7,791 $ 7,598 $ 7,584 Landfill 2,657 2,660 2,743 Transfer 1,570 1,451 1,435 Wheelabrator 819 789 802 Recycling and other 894 635 592 Intercompany (2,157 ) (1,999 ) (1,994 ) Total NASW $ 11,574 $ 11,134 $ 11,162 The following table provides details associated with the period to period change in NASW revenues (dollars in millions) along with an explanation of the significant components of the current period changes. Period to Period Period to Period Change for Change for 2003 vs. 2002 2002 vs. 2001 Price: Base business $ 69 0.6 % $ 72 0.6 % Commodity 13 0.1 69 0.6 Electricity 4 (34 ) (0.3 ) Fuel 33 0.3 (25 ) (0.2 ) Total price 119 1.0 82 0.7 Volume (16 ) (0.1 ) (174 ) (1.6 ) Internal growth 103 0.9 (92 ) (0.9 ) Acquisitions 334 3.0 82 0.7 Divestitures (54 ) (0.4 ) (12 ) (0.1 ) Foreign currency translation 57 0.5 (6 ) $ 440 4.0 % $ (28 ) (0.3 )% Price Base Business 2003 versus 2002 The increase in base business pricing is attributable to our collection, transfer and waste to energy businesses, with a significant increase in our residential collection operations. Certain of these price increases relate to additional costs and taxes that have been charged to our customers. However, the increase was partially offset by our landfill business, where we experienced decreases in price related revenue principally 27 due to our special waste landfill operations, mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the United States. 2002 versus 2001 The revenue increase due to price in our base business was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations. However, these increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations. Price Commodity 2003 versus 2002 The commodity price increases in 2003 were driven by the prices of ONP and plastic commodities. ONP prices increased to an average of $69 per ton for 2003 as compared to an average of $67 per ton for 2002. Plastic commodity prices have increased an average of 50%. Partially offsetting these increases is a decline in the price of OCC, which has declined to an average of $64 per ton in 2003 as compared to an average of $71 per ton in 2002. 2002 versus 2001 There were significant increases in commodity prices in 2002 as compared to 2001, most notably an increase in OCC prices, which increased to an average price of $71 per ton for 2002 as compared to an average price of $45 per ton for 2001. Price Electricity and Fuel 2003 versus 2002 Electricity rates remained relatively flat in 2003 as compared to 2002. However, we experienced positive price increases due to increased fuel surcharges billed to customers as a result of higher fuel costs. 2002 versus 2001 Reduced electricity rates and fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change in 2002 as compared to the prior year. Volume 2003 versus 2002 The decrease in revenue due to volumes was primarily in our collection and recycling businesses. We believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition, particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the United States. Our loss of a contract with the City of Chicago during February 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling, accounting for lost revenues of approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills, primarily in the southern and western portions of the United States. 2002 versus 2001 The volume decline in 2002 as compared to 2001 largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations, with the exception of the southern portion of the United States, where we realized slight volume increases. We also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the United States. We believe that the overall decreased volumes, particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services, were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition. However, the declines were offset by increased volumes in our recycling operations of $19 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. 28 Acquisitions and Divestitures 2003 versus 2002 In connection with our formation of Recycle America Alliance in January 2003, we acquired the Peltz Group, the largest privately held recycler in the United States. We also acquired several collection businesses that complemented and enhanced our existing collection network. These increases were partially offset by divestitures of low margin operations. 2002 versus 2001 Revenue in 2002 increased due to a number of individually small acquisitions consummated during 2002 and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in 2001. The increases due to acquisitions were partially offset by 2002 divestitures. Foreign Currency Translation 2003 versus 2002 Fluctuations in the relative value of the Canadian dollar favorably affected revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2002 versus 2001 Fluctuations in the relative value of the Canadian dollar negatively affected revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating Costs and Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Shown Below) Our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits, risks management costs, fuel, facility operating costs, maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities, tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations, and accretion of and expense revisions relating to future landfill capping, closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation. Certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed, and include acquisition, engineering, upgrading, construction, capitalized interest, and permitting costs. Additionally, we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial, defense and tort claim costs. Such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating costs and expenses were $637 million higher than the prior year period, representing an increase of 9.3%. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating costs and expenses were 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2003, which is a 3.2 percentage point increase from the prior year period. The increase was generally due to: Increased cost of goods sold of approximately $205 million, largely related to higher commodity sales through our acquisition of the Peltz Group in January 2003; Increased disposal costs of approximately $104 million, attributable to related volume increases, disposal cost increases at third party facilities and increased taxes of approximately $18 million on disposal of waste in Pennsylvania, although the majority of the tax increases have been passed on to our customers as price increases; Salary and wage increases of approximately $59 million representing annual merit raises and increased overtime expenses, partially offset by headcount reductions; The reorganization of our operations in March 2002 and the determination that certain employee costs and facility related expenses were more appropriately classified as operating expenses after the adoption of the new organizational structure and the reclassification of these costs beginning in the second quarter of 2002, the first full accounting period that these organizational changes were effective. 29 During the first quarter of 2003, approximately $50 million of such costs have been classified as operating expenses that would have been reported as selling, general and administrative costs before the reorganization; The effect of strengthening of the Canadian dollar on foreign currency translation, which resulted in a $47 million increase in operating expenses related to our Canadian operations; An increase in fuel costs of approximately $45 million, an average increase of $0.19 per gallon; Increases in subcontractor costs of approximately $40 million due to (i) the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints primarily in the eastern portion of the United States, (ii) increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business, (iii) general volume increases and (iv) increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services; Increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately $24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003; Increased risk management expenses of approximately $20 million as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs; and Increased repair and maintenance costs of approximately $8 million, which is mostly from changes in the timing and scope of certain maintenance projects at our waste to energy facilities. Business acquisitions accounted for approximately $286 million of the increases discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating costs and expenses were $214 million higher than the prior year period, representing an increase of 3.2%. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating costs and expenses were 61.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002, which is a 2.8 percentage point increase from the prior year period. The increase was generally due to: A re characterization of certain costs that were reported as selling, general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in certain roles and responsibilities as a result of our March 2002 reorganization; Increases in disposal and subcontractor costs. Disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the disposal of waste in Pennsylvania, which were partially offset by decreases in disposal costs due to declines in volumes in 2002. Subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors for certain of our national account customers in areas where we do not provide services and increased use of third party transportation of waste to disposal facilities; Annual merit increases and other employee benefit cost increases; Higher costs associated with recycling commodities due primarily to an increase in market prices for OCC and ONP, which resulted in increased rebates paid to customers; and The recovery of claims against insurers for the reimbursement of environmental expenses recorded in 2001 as an offset to operating costs and expenses. These increases in operating costs and expenses were offset by headcount reductions as a result of the March 2002 reorganization and divestitures of our international operations in 2001 and the non solid waste operations in the first quarter of 2002. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses include management salaries, clerical and administrative costs, marketing costs, professional services, facility rentals, provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs, as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service. 30 For the year ended December 31, 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $176 million, or 12.6%, as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, the decrease was 2.0 percentage points from 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was generally due to: The re characterization of costs related principally to employee costs and facility related expenses, including property taxes, utilities, and risk management expenses, that have been reflected as operating costs since April 1, 2002, as discussed above in Operating Costs and Expenses; Cost savings of approximately $41 million through reductions in salary and other labor related costs as a result of our March 2002 reorganization and February and June 2003 restructurings; A reduction of over $20 million in costs due to managements focus on reducing spending related to professional fees, supplies, travel and entertainment and other administrative costs; and Favorable settlements of legal disputes in 2003 in addition to the unfavorable impact of increases in legal reserves in 2002. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to: Managements focus on reducing spending related to professional fees, travel and entertainment, and other administrative costs; Headcount reductions and the re characterization of certain expenses as costs of operations as a result of the March 2002 restructuring; and Divestitures of international and non solid waste operations in 2001 and in early 2002. These reductions were offset partially by increased costs associated with litigation settlements, higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy, workers compensation costs, and property related costs such as property taxes, maintenance and security. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life primarily on a straight line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements (generally from 3 to 7 years); (ii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from 3 to 50 years; (iii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post closure, on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site; and (iv) as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 143, amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event. As a percentage of operating revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 10.9% in 2003, 11.0% in 2002 and 12.1% in 2001. Depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 even after considering the effect of the accounting changes that resulted from our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 is primarily attributable to our adoption of SFAS No. 142, which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on January 1, 2002. Goodwill amortization for 2001 was $156 million, or 1.4% of operating revenues. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in 2001, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased 0.3% from 2001 to 2002. The following schedule reflects the 2001 adjusted net income (excluding goodwill 31 and negative goodwill amortization) as compared to the results of operations for December 31, 2002 and 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Reported net income $ 630 $ 822 $ 503 Add back: goodwill amortization, net of taxes 124 Adjusted net income $ 630 $ 822 $ 627 Basic earnings per common share: Reported net income $ 1.07 $ 1.34 $ 0.80 Goodwill amortization, net of taxes 0.20 Adjusted net income $ 1.07 $ 1.34 $ 1.00 Diluted earnings per common share: Reported net income $ 1.06 $ 1.33 $ 0.80 Goodwill amortization, net of taxes 0.20 Adjusted net income $ 1.06 $ 1.33 $ 1.00 Restructuring In 2002, we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic Groups to better align collection, transport, recycling and disposal resources. As part of the restructuring, we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1,900 field level administrative and operational positions. In 2002, we recorded $38 million in pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure. These charges included $36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and $2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements. In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating Groups to 66 from 91 at December 31, 2002, and reduced certain overhead positions to further streamline our organization. Management believes that this structure results in a more effective utilization of resources and enables us to serve our customers more efficiently. In connection with these restructuring efforts, we reduced our workforce by about 700 employees and 270 contract workers. We recorded $20 million of pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure, all of which was associated with employee severance and benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by these organizational changes and a focus on fully utilizing the capabilities of our information technology resources enabled us to further reduce our workforce in June 2003. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of 600 employee positions and 200 contract worker positions. We recorded $24 million of pre tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $11 million remains accrued for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of these workforce reductions. Our obligations for the accrued severance payments continue through the third quarter of 2005. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of $13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset, in part, by $5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges. In 2002, the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to (i) our receipt of approximately $11 million related to a previously impaired, non revenue producing asset, (ii) net gains of 32 approximately $8 million on divestitures during the year and (iii) reductions to legal reserves of approximately $8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately $7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items. In 2001, the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of $374 million, which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in July 1999 alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The final net cash settlement payment of $377 million, which is the amount provided by the settlement agreement plus accrued interest less our recoveries, was made in the third quarter of 2003. Additionally in 2001, we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately $15 million related to our international operations along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in Mexican solid waste operations of approximately $28 million. Offsetting these expenses was a net gain of $24 million (comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of $109 million and a held for use impairment of $85 million) from our decision during the third quarter of 2001 not to sell all but one of our independent power production plants, and the reclassification in the third quarter of 2001 of all but one of those plants from held for sale to held for use. Also included in asset impairments and unusual items for 2001 were reversals of certain loss contract reserves of $13 million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased consistently each year from 2001 to 2003. The decrease in interest expense is partially attributable to our increased utilization of tax exempt financing, which has resulted in a decline in our weighted average interest rate. The remaining decrease in interest expense from 2001 to 2003 is attributable to the overall positive impact of our interest rate derivative contracts, which are used to manage our interest rate exposure, and the general decline in interest rates. Interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by $90 million in 2003, $86 million in 2002 and $39 million in 2001. Other Income We experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 as compared to other years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment. In 2002, a company in which we held an approximately 17% interest was acquired by another entity. We also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition. The proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $404 million for 2003, $422 million for 2002 and $283 million for 2001 resulting in an effective income tax rate of 36.0%, 34.0%, and 36.1% for each of the three years, respectively. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits. Additionally, in 2003 we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits. In 2002 we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture. A tax benefit of approximately $31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carry back of losses by our Dutch subsidiary. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2001 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, non deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses, the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested, offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits. Additionally, in 2001 scheduled Canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of $42 million, which was 33 offset in part by a tax expense of $24 million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in Canada. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principle In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively, to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below. Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded approximately $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we recorded approximately $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded approximately $101 million, including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping, closure and post closure costs. In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded approximately $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. For a discussion of these variable interest entities see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a credit of $2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. In the first quarter of 2001, adoption of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, resulted in a gain, net of tax, of approximately $2 million. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Canadian, Wheelabrator and Recycling Groups. These Groups, when combined with certain other operations, comprise our North American Solid Waste, or NASW, operations. The operations not managed through our seven operating Groups are presented herein as Other NASW. 34 As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, our restructuring and workforce reductions have impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002. The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments operating results (in millions). Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Canadian $ 76 (a) $ 37 (a) $ 73 Eastern 360 (b) 510 529 Midwest 323 345 356 Southern 589 571 584 Western 368 375 (c) 428 Wheelabrator 229 209 229 Recycling (7 ) 2 (23 ) Other NASW (26 ) (38 )(d) Total NASW $ 1,912 $ 2,011 $ 2,176 (a) A favorable legal settlement of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of $26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of the increase in 2003 income from operations as compared with 2002. The unfavorable 2002 legal settlement also had a significant effect on the comparability of 2002 and 2001 income from operations for our Canadian Group. (b) The most significant factors that affected the Eastern Groups 2003 operating income were (i) lower collection and landfill volumes, (ii) increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the United States, (iii) general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs and (iv) harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003. (c) The landfill line of business was the primary driver of the decline in 2002 income from operations as compared with 2001. Specifically, the Western Groups landfill volumes were significantly affected by (i) volume constraints in the Los Angeles market and (ii) volume declines at industrial landfills associated with the economic downturn in the western region of the United States that began in the second half of 2001 and continued throughout 2002 and into 2003. (d) Other NASW includes operations provided throughout our operating Groups for methane gas recovery and certain third party sub contract and administrative revenues managed by our national accounts function. Also included are certain year end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their individual Group performance for the periods disclosed. The decline in income from operations was driven in part by increased costs associated with our national accounts function, primarily due to 2001 credit adjustments for bad debt and loss contract reserves, and in part by the effect of unfavorable 2002 year end adjustments and favorable 2001 year end adjustments related to the reportable segments. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year $ 135 $ 264 $ 730 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,926 $ 2,153 $ 2,355 Cash used in investing activities $ (1,084 ) $ (962 ) $ (1,232 ) Cash used in financing activities $ (973 ) $ (1,658 ) $ (485 ) Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. We generated cash flows from operations of approximately $1.9 billion in 2003, which included approximately $109 million received for the fair value of interest rate swap agreements terminated prior to their scheduled maturities. Also included as a component of 2003 cash flows from operations is a net cash 35 outflow of approximately $223 million associated with the final settlement of our securities class action lawsuit, which occurred during the third quarter. Settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during the year includes: (i) a final net cash settlement payment of approximately $377 million associated with the settlement agreement of a shareholder class action suit plus accrued interest; (ii) utilization of insurance proceeds of approximately $87 million to settle the remaining portion of the settlement; (iii) a total tax benefit of approximately $138 million, of which we realized $66 million in the second quarter and $36 million in each of the third and fourth quarters and (iv) related net settlement recoveries of approximately $16 million. During 2003 we used $1.1 billion for investing activities, consisting of $1.2 billion for capital expenditures and $337 million for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, which were offset by net receipts of $371 million from restricted funds and proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other asset sales and other items of $82 million. Additionally, we used $1.0 billion for financing activities, which consisted primarily of the repurchase of shares of our common stock for $550 million and net debt reductions of $456 million. Our cash balances decreased by $466 million from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures, our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates. In 2002, cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by $166 million for cash received from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities, offset by cash paid of $66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances. Included in our investing activities was cash paid of $1.3 billion for capital expenditures and $162 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds of $487 million from other investing activities, primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds. Included in our financing activities was cash paid of $982 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, we paid $697 million for net debt reductions and received $27 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants. In 2001, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $2.4 billion. Favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of $59 million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and $64 million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities. Included in our investing activities was $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $116 million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses. These expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of $212 million. In addition, we used $485 million for financing activities, which is comprised of $510 million of net debt reductions and $25 million of other financing activities, offset by proceeds of $50 million from exercises of common stock options and warrants. We operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; our liquidity profile; our asset base; and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. In addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations, we have capital requirements for (i) capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites, as well as new trucks and equipment 36 for collection and other operations, (ii) refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and (iii) business acquisitions. For 2004, we currently expect to spend approximately $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion for capital expenditures and approximately $250 million for acquisitions. In February 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to $1 billion in annual repurchases for each year through 2004, to be implemented at managements discretion. Share repurchases in 2003 were less than the $1 billion allowed because we used funds that would have otherwise been available for this program to settle our securities class action lawsuit and for our acquisition program. We expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions. The following is a summary of activity to date for our stock repurchase program (in millions, except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars). Agreement Common Stock Total Net Common Purchase Settlement Stock Transaction Type Initiating Date Settlement Date Shares Price Price (Received)/Paid Repurchases Private Accelerated Purchase(a) March 2002 August 2002 10,925 $27.46 $ 300 $ (18 )(b) $ 282 Private Accelerated Purchase(a) December 2002 February 2003 1,731 $24.52 42 (3 )(c) 39 Private Accelerated Purchase(a) March 2003 May 2003 2,400 $20.00 48 3 (d) 51 Open Market Purchases(e) N/A N/A 45,244 $19.70 $29.48 1,184 N/A 1,184 60,300 $ 1,574 $ 1,556 (a) We accounted for the initial payments as a purchase of treasury stock and classified the future settlements with the counterparty as an equity instrument because we had the option under these agreements to settle our obligations, if any, in shares of our common stock. (b) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $18 million less than the approximately $300 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the counterparty paid us this difference of approximately $18 million at the end of the valuation period, which occurred during the third quarter of 2002, to settle the agreement. We accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. (c) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $3 million less than the approximately $42 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the agreement, the counterparty paid us the difference of approximately $3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement. (d) The weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately $3 million more than the approximately $48 million we initially paid. Pursuant to the agreement, we paid the counterparty the difference of approximately $3 million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement. (e) During 2003 we purchased 19.6 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately $526 million. During 2002 we purchased 25.6 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately $658 million. We engaged in these purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to law and our insider trading policy. In August 2003, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend program beginning in 2004. It is expected that the dividend will be $0.1875 per share per quarter, or $0.75 per share annually. The first quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share will be paid on March 25, 2004 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2004. Our 2004 dividend payments are expected to result in a cash outlay of approximately $430 million. 37 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post closure $ 109 $ 118 $ 83 $ 71 $ 98 $ 1,165 $ 1,644 Environmental remediation 57 62 29 17 13 198 376 166 180 112 88 111 1,363 2,020 Debt payments(b) 514 (c) 863 433 475 518 5,708 8,511 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Non cancelable operating lease obligations(e) 81 75 69 62 49 230 566 Unconditional purchase obligations(f) 204 102 95 75 73 306 855 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2003 $ 965 $ 1,220 $ 709 $ 700 $ 751 $ 7,607 $ 11,952 (a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 without the impact of discounting and inflation. The environmental liabilities included in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 are based upon the estimated fair value of the final capping, closure and post closure obligations associated with the airspace capacity that has been consumed at our landfills through the end of the reporting period and our estimates of probable environmental remediation obligations. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. (b) Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our 2004 interest payments are expected to be approximately $500 million. Additionally, we use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure associated with the terms of these instruments. (c) We have $819 million of debt obligations with contractual maturities on or before December 31, 2004. This includes $150 million of 8.0% senior notes due April 30, 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes due May 15, 2004 and $294 million of 7% senior notes due October 1, 2004. We have classified $550 million of these debt obligations as long term at December 31, 2003 because we have the intent and ability to refinance these obligations with long term debt instruments. Classified as a current obligation at December 31, 2003 is $245 million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the reoffering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed offering. (d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (e) Included in our non cancelable operating lease obligations are minimum rent payments for two of our waste to energy facilities that are required under leasing arrangements that we have with unconsolidated variable interest entities. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of these lease agreements. Our commitments under these lease arrangements do not materially impact our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. (f) See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations. However, we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and, when appropriate, will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we had a three year, $650 million syndicated revolving credit facility and a five year, $1.75 billion syndicated revolving credit facility. The three year revolver matures in June 2005 and the five year revolver matures in June 2006. At December 31, 2003, no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately $792 million. As of December 31, 2003, we are required to maintain the following financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities: (i) an interest coverage ratio; (ii) total debt to EBITDA ratio; and (iii) minimum net worth, all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the 38 covenants. The interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of (A) our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to (B) consolidated total interest expense for such period, to be less than 3 to 1. The total debt to EBITDA covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter, we will not permit the ratio of (A) all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to (B) EBIT plus depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed 3.25 to 1. Our minimum net worth covenant restricts us from allowing stockholders equity to be less than $3.5 billion plus 75% of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter, beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001. The credit facilities requiring compliance with these financial covenants state that the calculations must be based on generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and applied by us during the latest fiscal year before the date of the facilities, or December 31, 2000 and 2001. Therefore, our adoption or implementation of accounting pronouncements or interpretations effective after those dates does not impact the calculation of the financial covenants defined above. We are in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facilities and all other debt instruments. We have increased our utilization of tax exempt financing and plan to continue this trend due to the attractive rates offered for these instruments. As such, we continue to assess our financial assurance and letter of credit requirements and expect that we will arrange additional long term letter of credit and or surety bond capacity in advance of our business requirements. We have issued tax exempt bonds primarily for the construction of collection and disposal facilities. Proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities. Accordingly, we report these amounts as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid. At December 31, 2003, approximately $465 million of funds were held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities. These fund balances are included as other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Historically, proceeds from the issuance of tax exempt bonds held in trust funds have been invested in cash and cash equivalents. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003 we determined that it would be beneficial to invest these funds in longer term, higher yield debt instruments. As of December 31, 2003, $397 million of our trust fund assets funded by tax exempt bonds and held for future capital expenditures were invested in U.S. government agency debt securities with maturities ranging from less than one year to three years. We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, which was approximately 63% fixed and 37% floating at December 31, 2003. In addition, we use variable rate tax exempt financings and periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the then current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to (i) lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, (ii) product and service purchase commitments as discussed in the Other long term commitments section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and (iii) guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These lease agreements and purchase commitments are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities, products and services at competitive, market driven prices. Our third party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the period ended December 31, 2003 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 39 Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months, primarily due to the lower volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to decrease during the winter months. Our first and fourth quarter results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. We also use the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste to energy facilities, so repair and maintenance expense is generally higher in our first quarter than in other quarters during the year. In addition, particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations. We believe that inflation has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, managements estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental liabilities.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2003, all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions, with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations. An instantaneous, one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at both December 31, 2003 and 2002 by approximately $500 million. This analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. Since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately $752 million of restricted funds held in trust funds and escrow accounts included as a component of other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet. These funds are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. 40 Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. There would be no material impact if there were an instantaneous 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates at either December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled waste paper products such as ONP and OCC from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under these swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. We record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits. An instantaneous 10% increase in OCC and ONP prices would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately $10 million on both December 31, 2003 and 2002. This analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged. See Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 41
