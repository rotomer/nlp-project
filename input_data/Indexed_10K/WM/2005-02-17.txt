Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended December 31, 2004. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1 of this report, under the section Factors Influencing Future Results and Accuracy of Forward Looking Statements. The following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We had some positive experiences in 2004, but also some challenges. Volumes were generally strong throughout 2004, providing the most significant volume related revenue growth we had seen in a few years. While generating revenue growth from pricing remained difficult, we experienced a positive change in yield on base business in 2004. We had reasonable success with price increases to existing customers in our collection line of business in most markets. However, we continue to experience increased pricing competition in our collection operations, characterized by offers from competitors to our customers to provide the same services at much lower prices than we are charging and by lower average rates being offered by the competition on new business bids. This was especially prevalent in the Midwest Group. Additionally, we experienced declines in yield from 2003 to 2004 for our landfill operations, due largely to competitive pricing on special waste, although those declines were partially offset by increased municipal solid waste pricing. Although we saw an economic recovery in 2004 that brought with it increased volumes, we did not experience significantly increased pricing. We previously implemented a pricing model for our collection operations, and recently announced a landfill pricing study. Pursuant to this study, we chose 30 landfills at which we will be increasing pricing on municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste. The objective is to gather and analyze information to help us better understand the reactions to the increases, which will help us to manage our pricing in the future. We also had continued success in implementing our operational excellence initiatives during 2004. In the area of safety, we launched Mission to Zero in late 2000 with the objective of promoting zero tolerance for unsafe actions, conditions and attitudes across the organization. Our goal is to attain world class safety for the protection of our employees, customers and communities. We continue to see improvements in both our total recordable incident rate and hourly accident recordable rate, which are the metrics we use to measure our success in attaining this goal. We also continued to make progress in 2004 in the area of fleet maintenance and route optimization. The metric we use for our fleet maintenance is maintenance cost per driver hour, which we try to improve through basic planning and scheduling of maintenance work as well as enhanced training. For our route optimization initiative, we use a proprietary software application called WasteRoute, designed to help us organize our routes more efficiently. We believe the optimization initiative has resulted in improved productivity as we continue to reduce the number of routes. Our plans going forward are to institutionalize the best practices we have identified to support our future productivity improvement. In 2004, we experienced increases in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as compared with the prior year. However, these costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat, which we believe demonstrates the effectiveness of our cost reduction programs in these areas. We experienced the increases in operating expenses that are expected as a result of increased revenues. The biggest drivers increasing costs of operations were increased subcontractor costs as a result of higher volumes, some of which came from the hurricane clean up work, higher costs of goods sold, fuel costs and an increase in the cost of steel. Our costs of goods sold include rebates made by the Recycling Group to suppliers, and are based on market prices of recyclable commodities. Fuel costs also increased during the year, although a significant portion of those costs were offset through our fuel surcharges to customers. The increase in dollars spent in 2004 on selling, general and administrative costs related to increased salaries and wages and increased commissions and bonuses, which are a result of the overall improvement in our operating results. Additionally, we experienced increased professional fees as a result of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and increased litigation, defense and indemnification costs related to legal matters. 23 We believe that the production of free cash flow is a very important measure of our liquidity and operating results as it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase stock and execute our acquisition program. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and is not intended to replace the consolidated statement of cash flows that was prepared in accordance with GAAP. We generated approximately $1.06 billion in free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2004. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities, and adding to that the proceeds from divestitures, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets, as shown in the following table (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,218 Capital expenditures (1,258 ) Proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net of cash divested, and other sales of assets 96 Free cash flow $ 1,056 We are projecting full year 2005 free cash flow to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, based on estimated net cash provided by operating activities being in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion, capital expenditures between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, and proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets of $125 million to $150 million. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated and Segment Financial Information As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the following reclassifications have been made in our prior period financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation: Mandated fees and taxes We conformed the prior years presentation of our revenues and expenses with the current years presentation by increasing both our revenue and our operating expenses by approximately $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and by approximately $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Cash balances We increased both our cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable balances at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 by approximately $82 million, $95 million and $25 million, respectively, upon identifying certain cash accounts with negative balances and no legal right of offset. The related changes in our accounts payable balances during each reporting period have been treated as financing activities within the statement of cash flows as a component of cash used in financing activities other. Foreign currency translation We decreased both our accrued liabilities balance and our accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 by approximately $39 million and $2 million, respectively to reflect an adjustment required to fully capture the impact of foreign currency translation on our consolidated Canadian operations. Equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities Our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated entities has historically been presented as a component of other income in our statements of operations and the related cash flow impact has been reflected as a component of the change in other assets within our statements of cash flows. As a result of investments we made during 2004, this activity has become a more significant component of our net income and operating cash flow activity. Accordingly, we have shown equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities as a separate component within our statement of operations and equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated entities, net of distributions, as a separate component of cash provided by operating activities. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. Net deferred tax liability During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a detailed review of our deferred tax balances and related tax basis balance sheets. The culmination of this effort was a 24 decrease in our net current deferred tax assets of approximately $310 million, and a decrease in our net long term deferred tax liabilities of approximately $356 million as of December 31, 2003. The resultant over accrual of our net deferred tax liability of approximately $46 million was recorded as a reduction of goodwill as this adjustment is associated with our previous acquisition activity. Our deferred tax balances and goodwill as of December 31, 2003 have been adjusted to reflect this change. Segments Early in the third quarter of 2004, we implemented a market realignment that consisted of moving our Ohio operations to the Midwest Group and our Kentucky operations to the Southern Group, both of which were previously in the Eastern Group. We believe that the realignment will provide benefits to each of the operating groups affected. Specifically, the Ohio Market Area faces many of the same issues as other industrial regions in the Midwest Group and the Kentucky Market Areas rural characteristics make it similar to other markets in the Southern Group. By balancing the revenues between each of the Groups, we will enable the Eastern Group leadership team to focus on the challenges associated with the Northeast corridor. As a result of the realignment, we have reclassified the operating results of the Ohio and Kentucky Market Areas for all periods presented to provide segment financial information that appropriately reflects our approach to managing operations. Additionally, certain other minor reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financials statements in order to conform to the current year presentation. The financial information included herein has been updated to reflect these changes. Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions In preparing our financial statements, we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment. The most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments, as described below. Landfills Effective January 1, 2003, our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure, as well as landfill final capping, changed as a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Through December 31, 2002, the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with (i) amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and (ii) future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice, referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry, continues to be followed, with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill, as was the practice prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 143. The cost estimates for final capping, closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes. We also estimate additional costs, pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 143, based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally. We estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post closure activities. Because landfill final capping, closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. Landfill Costs We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its final capacity. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and 25 landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs are dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining amortizable basis related to costs to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace amortization, and projections of future purchase and development costs. Final Capping Costs We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events. They then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually or more often, as significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events where the associated capacity is fully consumed immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. However, as the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed asset, the adjustment to the asset must be amortized immediately through expense. Closure and Post Closure Costs We base our estimates for closure and post closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post closure maintenance and monitoring. The estimates for landfill closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Available Airspace Our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills. This is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate, based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors, how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity. Expansion Airspace We also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances. First, to include airspace associated with an expansion effort, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year, and the final expansion permit to be received within five years. Second, we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is likely, using the following criteria: Personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill; It is likely that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located; Either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan; There are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion; Financial analysis has been completed, and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact; and Airspace and related costs, including additional closure and post closure costs, have been estimated based on conceptual design. These criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. However, our policy provides that, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill, if these criteria are not met, inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed. In these circumstances, inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific review process that includes approval of the Chief Financial Officer and a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of 26 Directors on a quarterly basis. Of the 73 landfill sites with expansions at December 31, 2004, 19 landfills required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace. Approximately three fourths of these landfills required approval by the Chief Financial Officer because legal, community or other issues could impede the expansion process, while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements, which in many cases were due to state specific permitting procedures. When we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to final capping, and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill. After determining the costs at our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed. We look at factors such as the waste stream, geography and rate of compaction, among others, to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities. We then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons, giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill. We calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually or more often, as significant facts change. It is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner, the costs of the landfill, including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion, may be subject to impairment testing, as described below. Lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates, higher closure and post closure rates, and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace. Additionally, if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately. Environmental Remediation Liabilities Under current laws and regulations, we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. Remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business. These costs include potentially responsible party (PRP) investigation, settlement, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up, such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy. We estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation, considering whether we were an owner, operator, transporter, or generator at the site, the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site. Next, we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on: Managements judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites; Information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation; The number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and The typical allocation of costs among PRPs. Asset Impairments Our long lived assets, including landfills and landfill expansions, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. However, accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a 27 single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is determined by either an actual third party valuation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include: A significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group; A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition; A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset; Current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group; or A current expectation that, more likely than not, a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If any of these or other indicators occur, we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment. Several of these indicators are beyond our control, and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur. Additionally, estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. There are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill, as described below. Landfills Certain of the indicators listed above require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry. Goodwill At least annually, we assess whether goodwill is impaired. Upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment, we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole, as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated. Additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances, such as those listed above, that would indicate that, more likely than not, the book value of goodwill has been impaired. 28 Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the period to period change in dollars (in millions) and percentages for the respective statement of operations line items: Period to Period Change Years Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Statement of Operations: Operating revenues $ 868 7.5 % $ 437 3.9 % Costs and expenses: Operating (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) 637 8.4 642 9.2 Selling, general and administrative 51 4.2 (176 ) (12.6 ) Depreciation and amortization 71 5.6 43 3.5 Restructuring (45 ) * 6 * Asset impairments and unusual items (5 ) * 26 * 709 7.0 541 5.7 Income from operations 159 10.3 (104 ) (6.3 ) Other income (expense): Interest expense, net 42 9.8 19 4.3 Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated entities (102 ) * (2 ) (33.3 ) Minority interest (30 ) * 1 14.3 Other, net (14 ) * (33 ) * (104 ) (24.9 ) (15 ) (3.7 ) Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 55 4.9 (119 ) (9.6 ) Provision for income taxes (157 ) * (18 ) (4.3 ) Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles $ 212 29.5 % $ (101 ) (12.3 )% * Percentage change is not meaningful.

As shown below, North American Solid Waste, or NASW, is our principal operation, and is comprised of seven operating Groups within North America, along with our Other NASW services. The operations shown as Non NASW Divested Operations in the table below consisted of our non solid waste services, which were divested as of March 31, 2002.

Some of the fees we charge to our customers for collection services are billed in advance; a liability for future service is recorded when we bill the customer and operating revenues are recognized as services are actually provided. Revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties generally based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the volume of waste deposited, taking into account our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site and are normally billed monthly. Recycling revenue, which is generated by our Recycling Group as well as our five geographic operating Groups, generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees. Intercompany revenues between our operations have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The mix of NASW operating revenues from our different services is reflected in the table below (in millions).

In our collection business, the most substantial yield improvements during 2004 were in our industrial and residential operations, where nearly all of our operating groups experienced base business pricing improvements. Although the change in yield provided by our collection operations throughout 2004 has been positive, it was affected by increased price competition, particularly in the Midwest, and the unfavorable impact of lower priced recycling and yard waste service programs in the South. The base business yield improvements in our transfer business throughout 2004 31 have been almost exclusively attributable to the Eastern portion of the United States. However, increased pricing in our transfer business in the East has negatively affected our volume related revenue in that region. The base business yield increases during 2004 have been partially offset by average yield declines in our landfill operations. This decline is primarily the net result of the continued impact of lower pricing for special waste, particularly in the South and Midwest, which has been partially offset by increased pricing for municipal solid waste disposal. In 2003, the increase in base business yield as compared to 2002 was attributable to our collection, transfer and waste to energy businesses, with a significant increase in our residential collection operations. Certain of these price increases related to additional costs and taxes were passed on to our customers. However, the increase was partially offset by our landfill business, where we experienced decreases in price related revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations, mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the Southern and Western portions of the United States. Commodity Our revenues in both 2004 and 2003 were positively affected by price increases in all of the recycling commodities that we process. Average prices for old corrugated cardboard were up approximately 33% during the year, from $64 per ton in 2003 to $85 per ton in 2004. Average prices for old newsprint have also improved year over year by approximately 25%, from $69 per ton in 2003 to $86 per ton in 2004. However, a significant portion of increases from commodity prices is rebated to our suppliers, thereby increasing our cost of goods sold resulting in a relatively small impact to our income from operations. Fuel surcharges and fees We experienced revenue improvements during 2004 due to our continued effort to pass on higher fuel costs to our customers through fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges increased revenues year over year by approximately $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and approximately $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. These increases were more than offset by increased operating costs due to higher diesel fuel prices as discussed in Operating Expenses Fuel. Volume During 2004, we experienced significant volume related revenue increases in our collection and landfill businesses, driven principally by our Southern and Western Groups. A substantial portion of volume related revenue growth is due to the volume increases each of our operating groups has experienced in its industrial collection operations. In the Southern and Western portions of the United States, our residential collection and transfer volumes have also made substantial contributions to revenue growth throughout the year. Additionally, hurricane clean up efforts increased the Southern Groups 2004 volume related revenues by approximately $115 million. Landfill volume increases have also provided significant revenue improvements during 2004. The volume increases in our landfill business have been the most significant in the South and West, where increases in both construction and demolition waste and special waste have been substantial. Excluding the impact of hurricanes, we believe that a relatively strong economic environment has driven our volume related revenue improvements. Our revenue due to volumes decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily in our collection and recycling businesses. We believe the 2003 declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition, particularly in the Eastern and Midwestern portions of the United States. Our loss of a contract with the City of Chicago during February 2003 was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling, accounting for lost revenues of approximately $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills, primarily in the Southern and Western portions of the United States. Acquisitions In 2004, the increase in revenues due to acquisitions was largely related to the full year impact of our acquisition of collection assets from Allied Waste Industries, Inc. in the third and fourth quarters of 2003. Other acquisitions of recycling, transfer and waste to energy businesses consummated subsequent to the third quarter of 2003 also provided increases in revenues during 2004. In 2003, we also acquired the Peltz Group, the largest privately held recycler in the United States. 32 Operating Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Shown Below) Our operating expenses include (i) labor and related benefits, which include salaries and wages, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs relating to both equipment and facilities; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities; (v) costs of goods sold, which are primarily the rebates paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; (vi) fuel costs, which represent the costs of fuel and oils to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; and (viii) other operating costs, which include equipment and facility rent, property taxes, insurance and claims costs and landfill operating costs. The following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses, including the impact of foreign currency translation, for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Labor and related benefits $ 2,915 $ 141 5.1 % $ 2,774 $ 78 2.9 % $ 2,696 Transfer and disposal costs 1,277 89 7.5 1,188 56 4.9 1,132 Maintenance and repairs 706 14 2.0 692 15 2.2 677 Subcontractor costs 887 189 27.1 698 51 7.9 647 Cost of goods sold 620 123 24.7 497 201 67.9 296 Fuel 401 79 24.5 322 47 17.1 275 Disposal and franchise fees and taxes 629 29 4.8 600 59 10.9 541 Other 793 (27 ) (3.3 ) 820 135 19.7 685 $ 8,228 $ 637 8.4 % $ 7,591 $ 642 9.2 % $ 6,949 When comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 to other periods, our 2002 restructuring, as discussed below within Restructuring, resulted in the re characterization of certain labor and facility related costs. Through March 31, 2002, these costs were included within other selling, general and administrative costs. After the adoption of the new organizational structure these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since April 1, 2002, when the organizational changes became effective. The components of operating expenses impacted are labor and related benefits as well as other operating expenses. Labor and related benefits After excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling, general and administrative costs as discussed above, these costs have increased year over year as a result of (i) higher salaries and hourly wages when compared with the prior year due to annual merit increases; (ii) increased overtime costs due in part to increased volumes; and (iii) salary and hourly wage costs related to acquisitions. Additionally, the increases in 2004 and to a lesser extent in 2003 have been partially offset by savings realized as a result of our 2003 workforce reductions. Transfer and disposal costs The increases are due principally to volume increases from both general operating activities and acquisitions. Subcontractor costs These cost increases during 2004 as compared with the prior year are primarily due to higher volumes we have experienced throughout the year, including increased subcontractor costs of approximately $78 million in 2004 attributable to hurricane clean up services provided by our Southern Group. Also contributing to the increases are (i) the impact of acquisitions; (ii) increased third party transportation costs in our Western Group due to the service requirements of certain event work; (iii) higher fuel surcharges paid to third party subcontractors; and (iv) additional transportation costs in our Eastern Group due to capacity constraints at some of our landfills. 33 In 2003, we also experienced, to a lesser extent, the effects of the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints in the Eastern Group. Additionally, we had increased subcontractor costs in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to (i) increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business; (ii) general volume increases; and (iii) increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services. Cost of goods sold Our Recycling Group provides our suppliers with rebates that are driven by market prices of recyclable commodities, which means that the increase in cost of goods sold correlates directly to the increase in the market prices of these commodities and our revenue yield. Fuel We experienced an average increase of $0.30 per gallon for 2004 as compared with 2003 and in 2003 we experienced an average increase of $0.19 per gallon over 2002. However, a significant portion of this cost increase is offset by our fuel surcharges to customers, which are reflected as fuel price increases within our Operating Revenues section above. Other operating expenses The primary reason for the decrease during 2004 as compared with 2003 is the impact of the December 31, 2003 consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities from which we lease three waste to energy facilities. Prior to the consolidation of these entities, we accounted for these arrangements as operating leases. The consolidation of these entities has, therefore, resulted in a decline in rental expense in 2004, which was mostly offset by increases in depreciation, interest expense and minority interest expense. Additionally, in 2004, we experienced increased landfill and environmental costs, but had partially offsetting gains from the sale of certain assets. After excluding the cost increases due to the recharacterization of selling, general and administrative costs as discussed above, the increase in 2003 other operating expenses over 2002 is partially attributable to (i) increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately $24 million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of SFAS No. 143 and (ii) increased risk management expenses of approximately $20 million largely as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs. Selling, General and Administrative Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor costs, which include salaries, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, and payroll taxes; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit, and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees; and (iv) other general and administrative expenses, which include facility related expenses, voice and data telecommunications, advertising, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage, and printing. The following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31 for the respective periods (in millions): Period to Period to 2004 Period Change 2003 Period Change 2002 Labor and related benefits $ 741 $ 15 2.1 % $ 726 $ (55 ) (7.0 )% $ 781 Professional fees 169 18 11.9 151 (8 ) (5.0 ) 159 Provision for bad debts 48 2 4.3 46 2 4.5 44 Other 309 16 5.5 293 (115 ) (28.2 ) 408 $ 1,267 $ 51 4.2 % $ 1,216 $ (176 ) (12.6 )% $ 1,392 Labor and related benefits We realized an increase in labor and related benefits for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the prior year primarily attributable to (i) increased commissions paid to our sales personnel; (ii) higher salaries and hourly wages that were partially offset by the 2003 workforce reduction; and (iii) higher bonus expense due to the overall improvement in our performance for 2004. A decline in our use of contract labor has partially offset these increases. 34 During the year ended December 31, 2003, the overall reduction in labor and related benefits was a result of reductions in salary and other labor related costs, which were primarily derived from our March 2002 reorganization and February and June 2003 restructurings. Professional fees We experienced increases in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of higher litigation and defense costs and consulting fees for both general business reasons and our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. We did not see a significant fluctuation in professional fees between the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Other selling, general and administrative costs During 2003, we obtained favorable settlements for legal disputes, which are driving the apparent increase in costs in 2004 as compared with 2003. After excluding this impact, we have maintained our cost reduction efforts that were put in place in 2003. In 2003, management focused on reducing spending related to travel and entertainment and other administrative costs. This focus on cost reduction is a primary factor for the lower other selling, general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with 2002. Additionally, in 2002 we experienced increases in our legal reserves that resulted in an unfavorable effect on results as compared with 2003. Also, when comparing the year ended December 31, 2002 to other periods, our 2002 restructuring, as discussed below within Restructuring, resulted in the re characterization of certain labor and facility related costs. Through March 31, 2002, these costs were included within other selling, general and administrative costs. After the adoption of the new organizational structure, these costs were deemed more appropriate to be classified as operating costs and as such have been recorded as operating expenses since April 1, 2002, which is when the organizational changes became effective. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization includes (i) amortization of intangible assets with a definite life, either using a 150% declining balance approach or a straight line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements, which are from two to ten years depending on the type of asset; (ii) depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from three to 50 years; (iii) amortization of landfill costs, including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development, construction, closure and post closure, on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site; and (iv) amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily related to (i) an increase in our landfill amortization rate, net of the adjustment related to our landfill retirement costs, of $0.19 per ton, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in landfill airspace amortization due to higher volumes; (ii) increased information technology depreciation expense recognized as a result of placing additional enterprise wide software systems into service during the latter half of 2003; and (iii) increased depreciation expense for our Wheelabrator Group as a result of consolidating two variable interest entities. The increase in our landfill airspace and landfill asset retirement cost amortization in 2004 was partially offset by the impact of approximately $18 million of incremental changes related to our final capping, closure and post closure obligations due to (i) the addition of new landfill expansions and the removal of certain expansions from the landfill cost base; (ii) permit modifications; (iii) the settlement of final capping events; and (iv) changes in certain estimates that are derived from an annual review which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year. Depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003. Restructuring In 2002, we reorganized our operations to form market areas within our geographic Groups to better align collection, transport, recycling and disposal resources. As part of the restructuring, we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately 1,900 field level administrative and operational 35 positions. In 2002, we recorded $38 million in pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure. These charges included $36 million for employee severance and benefit costs and $2 million related to abandoned operating lease agreements. All payments related to this restructuring have been made. In February 2003, we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating Groups and reduced certain overhead positions to streamline our organization. As a result, we incurred approximately $20 million in one time employee severance and benefit costs. The operational efficiencies provided by the February 2003 organizational changes enabled us to further reduce our workforce in June 2003. We recorded $24 million of pre tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction during 2003. During 2004, we recorded a $1 million credit to reduce our accrual for severance costs associated with these workforce reductions. As of December 31, 2004, substantially all obligations associated with the February restructuring and workforce reduction have been paid. The first quarter of 2005 is the final period we are obligated to make any severance payments to employees associated with the February 2003 reorganization and workforce reduction. Approximately $1 million remains accrued as of December 31, 2004 for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of the June 2003 workforce reduction, which will be paid to certain employees through the third quarter of 2005. Asset Impairments and Unusual Items In 2004, the net gain of $13 million for asset impairments and unusual items related to (i) $17 million in impairment losses primarily due to the impairment of certain landfill assets and software development costs; (ii) $15 million in gains on divestitures that primarily related to certain Port O Let operations; and (iii) $15 million of gains in 2004 related to adjustments we made to our estimated obligations associated with our Non NASW Divested Operations and our receipt of cash from a third party for a previously settled remedial obligation. During 2003, we recorded a net gain of $8 million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of $13 million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset, in part, by $5 million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges. In 2002, the net gain of $34 million for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to (i) our receipt of approximately $11 million related to a previously impaired, non revenue producing asset, (ii) net gains of approximately $8 million on divestitures during the year and (iii) reductions to legal reserves of approximately $8 million and loss contract reserves of approximately $7 million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items. Income From Operations by Reportable Segment We manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our Eastern, Midwest, Southern, Western, Canadian, Wheelabrator and Recycling Groups. These Groups, when combined with certain other operations, comprise our NASW operations. The operations not managed through our seven operating Groups are presented herein as Other NASW. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, charges associated with our restructuring and workforce reductions impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in 2003 and 2002. The following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the year ended December 31 36 for each respective period and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments operating results (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Canadian $ 67 $ (9 ) (11.8 )% $ 76 $ 39 105.4 % $ 37 Eastern 337 20 6.3 317 (123 ) (28.0 ) 440 Midwest 358 5 1.4 353 (43 ) (10.9 ) 396 Southern 665 63 10.5 602 12 2.0 590 Western 390 22 6.0 368 (7 ) (1.9 ) 375 Wheelabrator 283 54 23.6 229 20 9.6 209 Recycling 25 32 457.1 (7 ) (9 ) (450.0 ) 2 Other NASW (19 ) 7 26.9 (26 ) 12 31.6 (38 ) Total NASW $ 2,106 $ 194 10.1 % $ 1,912 $ (99 ) (4.9 )% $ 2,011 Canadian While general economic factors, such as foreign currency rates, favorably affected operating results year over year, a favorable legal settlement of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an unfavorable legal settlement of $26 million in 2002 were the primary drivers of these changes. Eastern Operating income improvement from 2003 to 2004 was driven primarily by (i) revenue growth due to increased average yield across all major lines of business, partially offset by volume declines in transfer, residential collection and landfill operations throughout the year; (ii) higher operating expenses incurred in 2003 due to the first quarters harsh weather conditions; and (iii) acquisitions. These earnings improvements were partially offset by increased costs for labor and the transportation of waste, higher landfill amortization rates and the impairment of a landfill. The most significant factors affecting the decline from 2002 to 2003 were (i) lower collection and landfill volumes; (ii) increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the United States; (iii) general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs; and (iv) harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of 2003. Midwest Lower operating income in 2003 as compared with 2002 was primarily due to (i) the harsh winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2003 (ii) soft economic conditions leading to lower volume; and (iii) an increase in competitive activity leading to price roll backs and lost business. These economic and competitive pressures continued to impact the Midwests results during 2004. Southern Operating income in 2004 has been favorably affected by (i) positive internal revenue growth, largely due to volume increases in higher margin landfill operations; (ii) acquisitions; (iii) increased revenue during the second half of 2004 as a result of the hurricanes in the region during the third quarter; (iv) favorable landfill capping adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2004, largely offset by higher landfill amortization rates utilized throughout 2004; and (v) various operating and administrative cost reductions. These improvements were partially offset by the write off of a terminated landfill development project during the fourth quarter of 2004. Results for the Southern Group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003. Western The 2004 increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth, which is largely due to increased volumes in industrial and residential collection and transfer operations and average yield improvements in our commercial and residential collection operations. These gains were partially offset by (i) increased labor costs; (ii) higher fuel costs not passed on to customers; and (iii) increases in third party transportation and other subcontractor costs. Results for the Western Group were relatively consistent between 2002 and 2003. Wheelabrator The increase in 2004 operating income was due in large part to (i) positive internal revenue growth driven by improved electricity pricing and average yield improvements on long term disposal contracts and (ii) the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on December 31, 2003, which has increased income from operations as a result of decreased operating costs, partially offset by 37 increases in depreciation expense (the impact of the consolidation of these entities on income before income taxes is significantly reduced by increases in interest expense and minority interest expense). Wheelabrators 2003 operating results were favorably affected by an $11 million gain realized as a result of a legal settlement, which also significantly affected their trended income from operations for the years presented. Recycling The Recycling Groups 2004 operating revenues have been favorably affected by significantly higher market prices for recycling commodities. Improvements in the market prices for these commodities provide marginal increases to our income from operations because a substantial portion of changes in market prices are generally passed on as rebates to our suppliers. These favorable market conditions were the primary drivers of the current years increase in earnings. Other Components of Income Before Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles The following summarizes the other major components of our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): Period to Period Period to Period 2004 Change 2003 Change 2002 Interest expense, net $ 385 $ (42 ) 9.8 % $ 427 $ (19 ) (4.3 )% $ 446 Equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities 98 102 * (4 ) 2 (33.3 ) (6 ) Minority interest 36 30 * 6 (1 ) (14.3 ) 7 Other, net 2 14 * (12 ) 33 * (45 ) Provision for income taxes 247 (157 ) * 404 (18 ) (4.3 ) 422 * Percentage change not meaningful. Refer to the explanations of these items below for a discussion of the relationship between current year and prior year activity. Interest Expense, net In 2004, net interest expense decreased approximately $42 million when compared with 2003, which is due to a $58 million increase in interest income from $12 million in 2003 to $70 million in 2004. This increase is due primarily to interest income of $46 million realized on tax refunds received from the IRS for the settlement of several federal audits. Partially offsetting the benefit of the current year increase in interest income is a $16 million increase in interest expense, which is primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose variable interest entities on December 31, 2003 as a result of our implementation of FIN 46. The decline in net interest expense in 2003 when compared with 2002 can be largely attributed to our increased utilization of tax exempt financing, which contributed to a decline in our weighted average interest rate for the period. For all periods, we have experienced a positive impact to interest expense as a result of our interest rate derivative contracts, which we use to manage our exposure to changes in market interest rates. The combined benefit of active and terminated interest rate swap agreements resulted in interest expense reductions of approximately $90 million for 2004, approximately $96 million for 2003 and approximately $86 million for 2002. While we expect the benefits of our interest rate derivative contracts to continue in 2005, the benefit derived from our interest rate contracts will be impacted by changes in short term rates on our active agreements and will decline as the debt associated with terminated contracts matures. Of the $90 million in reductions to interest expense realized in 2004 for terminated and active interest rate swap agreements, $48 million related to the amortization of terminated swaps. Our terminated interest rate swaps are expected to reduce interest expense by $42 million in 2005, $41 million in 2006 and $37 million in 2007. Equity in Losses (Earnings) of Unconsolidated Entities In the first and second quarters of 2004, we acquired an equity interest in two coal based synthetic fuel production facilities. We account for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting 38 and their related losses are the reason for the 2004 versus 2003 change in equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities. These equity losses are more than offset by the tax benefit realized as a result of these investments as discussed below within Provision for Income Taxes. If, for any reason, the tax credits generated by the facilities were no longer allowable under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code, we would no longer incur these equity losses. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Minority Interest The increase in 2004 minority interest expense over prior years was primarily attributable to the consolidation of two special purpose type variable interest entities on December 31, 2003 as a result of our implementation of FIN 46. This increase was more than offset by an increase in our income from operations as a result of consolidating the entities. Additional information related to these investments is included in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Other, net Our other income and expense in 2003 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation. We experienced a significant impact to other income in 2002 due primarily to the sale of an equity investment. In 2002, a company in which we held an approximately 17% interest was acquired by another entity. We also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition. The proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Provision for Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of $247 million for 2004, $404 million for 2003 and $422 million for 2002 resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 21.0%, 36.0% and 34.0% for each of the three years, respectively. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2004 is primarily due to (i) the realization of non conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills and our investments in the coal based synthetic fuel production facilities discussed above within equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated entities; and (ii) the realization of a net benefit of approximately $101 million for tax audit settlements that occurred during the year; offset in part by (iii) state and local income taxes. The decrease of approximately $131 million in our tax provision attributable to our equity investments in the coal based synthetic fuel production facilities more than offset the related equity losses and interest expense for those entities discussed above. The difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits generated by our landfills. Additionally, in 2003 we recognized a $6 million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits. In 2002, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $16 million due to a capital gain generated in 2002 that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture. A tax benefit of approximately $31 million was also recognized in 2002 related to the carry back of losses by our Dutch subsidiary. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles On March 31, 2004, we recorded a credit of approximately $8 million, net of taxes, or $0.01 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the consolidation of previously unrecorded trusts as required by FIN 46. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 39 In the first and fourth quarters of 2003, we recorded net of tax charges of $46 million and $43 million, respectively, to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below. Through December 31, 2002, we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants. Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred. We recorded approximately $25 million, net of taxes, or $0.04 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Through December 31, 2002, we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues. Effective January 1, 2003, we recorded approximately $30 million, net of taxes, or $0.05 per diluted share, as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, we recorded approximately $101 million, including tax benefit, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. Substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping, closure and post closure costs. In connection with the application of FIN 46 to special purpose type variable interest entities, we recorded approximately $43 million, including tax benefit, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. For a discussion of these variable interest entities see Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a credit of $2 million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations. Liquidity and Capital Resources General As an organization that has consistently generated cash flows in excess of its reinvestment needs, our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations. However, we operate in a capital intensive business and continued access to various financing resources is vital to our continued financial strength. In the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive. Based on several key factors we believe are considered important by credit rating agencies and financial markets in determining our access to attractive financing alternatives, we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future. These factors include: the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base; our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment; our liquidity profile; our asset base; and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise during the year as a result of changing business conditions or new opportunities. In addition to our working capital needs for the general and administrative costs of our ongoing operations, we have cash requirements for: (i) the construction and expansion of our landfills; (ii) additions to and maintenance of our trucking fleet; (iii) refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy and materials recovery facilities; (iv) the container and equipment needs of our operations; and (v) capping, closure and post closure activities at our landfills. Beginning in 2002, we committed ourselves to providing our shareholders with a return on their investment 40 through our share repurchase program, and in 2004 began a quarterly dividend program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new capital allocation program that provides for up to $1.2 billion in aggregate dividend payments and share repurchases each year during 2005, 2006 and 2007. We also continue to invest in acquisitions that we believe will be accretive and provide continued growth in our core business. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) became law. A provision of the Act temporarily reduces the tax rate on repatriated income if the income is permanently reinvested in the U.S. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this legislation, which includes an analysis of the funds provided by our Canadian operations available for repatriation. However, we do not expect this legislation to materially impact our consolidated liquidity position. Summary of Cash, Restricted Trust and Escrow Accounts and Debt Obligations The following is a summary of our cash, restricted trust and escrow accounts and debt balances as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 (in millions): 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 443 $ 217 Restricted trust and escrow accounts: Tax exempt bond funds $ 333 $ 465 Closure, post closure and remediation funds 213 186 Debt service funds 83 89 Other 18 12 Total restricted trust and escrow accounts $ 647 $ 752 Debt: Current portion $ 384 $ 514 Long term portion 8,182 7,997 Total debt $ 8,566 $ 8,511 Increase in carrying value of debt due to hedge accounting for interest rate swaps $ 135 $ 168 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted trust and escrow accounts Restricted trusts and escrow accounts consist primarily of funds held in trust for the construction of various facilities or repayment of debt obligations, funds deposited in connection with landfill closure, post closure and remedial obligations and insurance escrow deposits. These balances are primarily included within long term other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. Debt Revolving credit and letter of credit facilities The table below summarizes the credit capacity, maturity and outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility and principal letter of credit facilities outstanding at December 31, 2004 (in millions). We also had an additional $88 million in 41 outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004 that have been issued under various arrangements, none of which provide for committed capacity. Outstanding Total Credit Letters of Facility Capacity Maturity Credit Five year revolving credit facility(a) $ 2,400 October 2009 $ 1,366 Five year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 15 June 2008 15 Five year letter of credit facility(b) 350 December 2008 349 Seven year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 175 June 2010 166 Ten year letter of credit and term loan agreement(b) 105 June 2013 101 Total $ 3,045 $ 1,997 (a) This facility provides us with credit capacity that could be used for either cash borrowings or letters of credit. At December 31, 2004, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, and we had unused and available credit capacity of approximately $1,034 million. (b) These facilities have been established to provide us with letter of credit capacity. In the event of an unreimbursed draw on a letter of credit, the amount of the draw paid by the letter of credit provider generally converts into a term loan for the remaining term under the respective agreement or facility. Through December 31, 2004 we had not experienced any unreimbursed draws on our letters of credit. We have used each of these facilities to support letters of credit that we issue to support our insurance programs, certain tax exempt bond issuances, municipal and governmental waste management contracts, closure and post closure obligations and disposal site or transfer station operating permits. These facilities require us to pay fees to the lenders and our obligation is generally to repay any draws that may occur on the letters of credit. We expect that similar facilities may continue to serve as a cost efficient source of letter of credit capacity in the future, and we continue to assess our financial assurance requirements to ensure that we have adequate letter of credit and surety bond capacity in advance of our business needs. On October 15, 2004, we renegotiated our three year, $650 million and five year, $1.75 billion revolving credit facilities, replacing them with a single, five year, $2.4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility. Senior notes During March 2004 we issued $350 million of 5.0% senior notes due March 15, 2014. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $346 million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses. We used these proceeds to repay $150 million of 8.0% senior notes due April 30, 2004 and $200 million of 6.5% senior notes due May 15, 2004. With cash on hand, we repaid $295 million of 7.0% senior notes that matured on October 1, 2004. We have $100 million of 7.0% senior notes and $3 million of 6.65% senior notes both due May 15, 2005 that we currently expect to redeem with available cash. Tax exempt bonds As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $2,047 million of outstanding tax exempt bonds. We issued approximately $345 million of tax exempt bonds during 2004, $35 million of which was issued to refinance higher rate tax exempt bonds. We actively issue tax exempt bonds as a means of accessing low cost financing for capital expenditures. The proceeds from these financing arrangements are deposited directly into trust funds and may only be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally the construction of collection and disposal facilities and for the equipment necessary to provide waste management services. As we spend monies on the specific projects being financed, we are able to requisition cash from the trust funds. As discussed in the restricted trusts and escrow accounts section above, we have approximately $333 million held in trust for future spending as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, we received $442 million from these funds for approved capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $590 million of our tax exempt bonds are remarketed weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. These bonds are supported by letters of credit that were issued primarily under our $2.4 billion, five year revolving credit facility, that guarantee repayment of the bonds in the event the bonds are put to us. During the second quarter of 2004, we fixed the interest rates of approximately $379 million of tax exempt bonds that had previously been remarketed on a weekly basis. 42 Because our variable rate tax exempt bonds require letter of credit support, fixing the interest rates of these debt instruments resulted in a decrease in our financial assurance needs. Tax exempt project bonds As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $496 million of outstanding tax exempt project bonds. These debt instruments are primarily used by our Wheelabrator Group to finance the development of waste to energy facilities. The bonds generally require periodic principal installment payments. As of December 31 2004, approximately $46 million of these bonds are remarketed either daily or weekly by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. Repayment of these bonds has been guaranteed with letters of credit issued under our five year revolving credit facility. Approximately $91 million of these bonds will be repaid with either available cash or debt service funds within the next twelve months. Convertible subordinated notes We had approximately $35 million of convertible subordinated notes that we repaid, with cash on hand, upon maturity on January 24, 2005. Interest rate swaps We manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, the interest payments on approximately $2.6 billion of our fixed rate debt have been swapped to variable rates, allowing us to maintain approximately 63% of our debt at fixed interest rates and approximately 37% at variable interest rates. Fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swap contracts increased the carrying value of debt instruments by approximately $135 million as of December 31, 2004 and approximately $168 million at December 31, 2003. Summary of Cash Flow Activity The following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 for each respective period (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,218 $ 1,926 $ 2,153 Net cash used in investing activities $ (863 ) $ (1,084 ) $ (962 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,130 ) $ (986 ) $ (1,588 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities During both 2003 and 2002, cash generated from operations was positively affected by cash we received of approximately $109 million and $166 million, respectively, from counterparties for terminating certain interest rate swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities. The positive cash receipts during 2002 were offset partially by cash payments of approximately $66 million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our 2002 debt issuances. Cash generated from operations during 2003 was negatively affected by a $223 million net cash outflow for the settlement of our securities class action lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003. Settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during 2003 includes: (i) a final net cash settlement payment, net of insurance proceeds of $377 million plus accrued interest; (ii) a total tax benefit of approximately $138 million and (iii) related net settlement recoveries of approximately $16 million. After adjusting 2003 and 2002 for the unusual items mentioned above, our 2004 cash flows from operations increased $178 million over 2003 and $165 million over 2002. Our improved earnings and the favorable effects of our investments in two synthetic fuel partnerships are the primary contributors of this increase. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities The primary contributor to the variation in cash used in investing activities is acquisition spending, which was $130 million in 2004, $337 million in 2003 and $162 million in 2002. In recent years, our business acquisition strategy has been to focus on tuck in acquisitions, which are 43 relatively small, accretive businesses that will easily integrate with, and provide value to, our existing operations. However, our 2003 acquisition activity was uncharacteristically high because of a few relatively large acquisitions that were made in addition to numerous smaller tuck in acquisitions, particularly in our recycling line of business. Our current market development and capital allocation strategies reflect our desire to continue to invest in businesses that will enable us to effectively utilize our existing assets and the development or acquisition of disposal assets, which tend to provide higher returns on investment and operating margins. We intend to continue to make accretive tuck in investments and expect acquisition spending in 2005 to be approximately $250 million. In addition to decreased acquisition spending, net receipts from restricted trust fund and escrow accounts in 2004 have increased $73 million over 2003 and $171 million over 2002. As discussed above, our restricted trust and escrow accounts are related to our (i) tax exempt bonds; (ii) closure, post closure and remedial requirements; or (iii) debt service requirements. The increase in cash received from these sources is due to increased utilization of this type of financing, which is a direct result of the favorable interest rates available. Our capital expenditures have been maintained at a manageable range of annual spending of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. We anticipate that our capital expenditures during 2005 will be in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Additionally, we continue to receive cash proceeds from divestitures and other sales of assets. In January of 2005, we received proceeds of approximately $89 million for the divestiture of one of our landfills due to a Divestiture Order from the Canadian Competition Bureau. From time to time, we may be required to divest of certain assets due to governmental regulations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities The primary reason for the increase in net cash used in financing activities is the payment of our quarterly dividends, which resulted in cash dividends of $432 million in 2004 compared with cash dividends of $6 million paid in each of 2003 and 2002. Our Board of Directors approved our quarterly dividend program in August 2003, and we have declared and paid a dividend of $0.1875 per share of common stock in each quarter of 2004, compared with the annual $0.01 per share dividend in 2003 and 2002. Additionally, the Board of Directors announced that it expects dividends to be $0.20 per share per quarter beginning in 2005. All future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. On January 28, 2005, the Board declared our first quarterly dividend under the program of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on March 24, 2005 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2005. Offsetting the increase in cash dividend payments were decreases in share repurchases and net debt repayments and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants. We paid approximately $496 million for share repurchases in 2004 as compared to $550 million paid during 2003 and $982 million paid in 2002. Our 2004 share repurchases include a cash payment of approximately $24 million to settle repurchases made in December 2003. Our 2004 stock repurchases and dividend payments were made under a capital allocation program that authorized management to spend up to $1 billion for this activity during the year. Since the inception of the repurchase program in February 2002, we have repurchased approximately 77 million shares of our common stock at a net cost of approximately $2 billion. We currently expect to continue repurchasing common stock under the capital allocation program discussed above. Future share repurchases under this program will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend on similar factors to those considered by the Board in making dividend declarations. Net debt repayments were approximately $386 million in 2004, $456 million in 2003 and $697 million in 2002. The following summary shows our most significant cash borrowings and debt repayments made during 2004: proceeds of approximately $346 million from the March 2004 issuance of $350 million of 5.0% senior notes; 44 repayment of $150 million of 8.0% senior notes that matured in April 2004, $200 million of 6.5% senior notes that matured in May 2004 and $295 million of 7.0% senior notes that matured in October 2004; and repayments of approximately $25 million of tax exempt bonds and $42 million of tax exempt project bonds. Cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises increased to $193 million in 2004 from $52 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. Increased cash receipts from common stock option and warrant exercises were driven by the increase in our stock price during the year. Summary of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Recorded Obligations: Expected environmental liabilities(a) Final capping, closure and post closure $ 100 $ 88 $ 95 $ 87 $ 87 $ 1,316 $ 1,773 Environmental remediation 62 49 30 16 13 194 364 162 137 125 103 100 1,510 2,137 Debt payments(b),(c) 382 491 526 535 684 5,824 8,442 Unrecorded Obligations:(d) Non cancelable operating lease obligations 102 91 81 65 57 927 1,323 Estimated unconditional purchase obligations(e) 211 192 107 101 101 436 1,148 Anticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2004 $ 857 $ 911 $ 839 $ 804 $ 942 $ 8,697 $ 13,050 a) Environmental liabilities include final capping, closure, post closure and environmental remediation costs. The amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 without the impact of discounting and inflation. Our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills. b) Our debt obligations as of December 31, 2004 include approximately $380 million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to re pricing within the next twelve months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities. If the re offering of the bonds is unsuccessful, then the bonds can be put to us, requiring immediate repayment. These bonds are not backed by letters of credit supported by our long term facilities that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed re offering and are, therefore, considered a current obligation. However, these bonds have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. The classification of these obligations as long term was based upon our intent to refinance the borrowings with other long term financings in the event of a failed re offering and our ability, in the event other sources of long term financing are not available, to use our $2.4 billion, five year revolving credit facility. c) Our recorded debt obligations include non cash adjustments associated with discounts, premiums and fair value adjustments for interest rate hedging activities. These amounts have been excluded here because they will not result in an impact to our liquidity in future periods. In addition, approximately $83 million of these future debt payments will be made with debt service funds held in trust and included as other assets within our December 31, 2004 balance sheet. d) Our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods. We have also made certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 10, that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. e) Our unconditional purchase obligations are generally quantity driven. We have therefore made estimates of our future obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations. We have contingencies that are not considered reasonably likely. As a result, the impact of these contingencies have not been included in the above table. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these contingencies. 45 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to (i) lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities and (ii) guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the Guarantees section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These lease agreements are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities at competitive, market driven prices. Our third party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations. These arrangements have not materially affected our financial position, results of operations or liquidity during the year ended December 31, 2004 nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Seasonal Trends and Inflation Our operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to the higher volume of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends. Additionally, certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the summer, such as the hurricanes experienced during the third quarter of 2004, actually increase our revenues in the areas affected, although, for several reasons, including significant start up costs, such revenues tend to provide lower margins. Conversely, harsh winter weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect the operating results of those periods. The operating results of our first quarter also often reflect higher repair and maintenance expenses because we rely on the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste to energy facilities. We believe that inflation has not had, and in the near future is not expected to have, any material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, managements estimates associated with inflation have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities. New Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, Canadian currency rates and certain commodity prices. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. Our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount, with no multipliers or leverage. As of December 31, 2004, all of our derivative transactions were related to actual or anticipated economic exposures although certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by our derivative counterparties. However, we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties, all of whom we either consider credit worthy, or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance. We have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions. This analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. The effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis. Fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements. Interest Rate Exposure. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations, which directly impacts variability in interest costs. 46 An instantaneous, one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would have decreased the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions by approximately $490 million at December 31, 2004 and $440 million at December 31, 2003. This analysis does not reflect the effect that increasing interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings, nor the unfavorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest. We are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately $647 million of assets held in trust funds and escrow accounts included primarily as a component of other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004. These assets are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure, post closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality, liquid instruments including money market accounts and U.S. government agency debt securities. Because of the short terms of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant. Currency Rate Exposure. From time to time, we have used currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany Canadian currency denominated debt. There would have been no material impact to our fair value position if there were an instantaneous 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 we have no foreign currency derivatives outstanding. Commodities Price Exposure. We market recycled products such as waste paper, aluminum and glass from our material recovery facilities. We enter into financial fiber swaps and options to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales. Under the swap agreements, we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time. With regard to our option agreements, we have purchased price protection on certain wastepaper sales via synthetic floors (put options) and price protection on certain wastepaper purchases via synthetic ceilings (call options). Additionally, we have entered into collars (combination of a put and call option) with financial institutions in which we receive the market price for our wastepaper and aluminum sales within a specified floor and ceiling. We record changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives not designated as hedges to earnings, as required. All derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy, which governs the type of instruments that may be used. An instantaneous 10% increase in recyclable material prices would decrease the fair value of our commodity derivatives by approximately $10 million at December 31, 2003 and by approximately $20 million at December 31, 2004. This analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity positions that are being hedged. See Notes 3 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments. 47
