ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors and Forward looking Statements. Overview We are a leading provider of money transfer services, operating in two business segments: Consumer to consumer money transfer services, provided primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for both international cross border transactions that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Consumer to business payment services, which allow consumers to send funds to businesses and other organizations that receive consumer payments, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers and government entities (all sometimes referred to as billers) through our network of third party agents and various electronic channels. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other and generated approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. The consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through an extensive network of agent locations that offer Western Union services around the world. Some of our agent locations only pay out and do not send money. In addition to our agent locations, we are expanding the ability of consumers to send money through other channels, such as our Internet site, westernunion.com, and the telephone. Consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through the Western Union&reg;, Orlandi Valuta&reg; and VigoSM brands, and includes locations offering any of our three brands. The consumer to business service allows consumers to transfer money to a biller. This service is available at many of our Western Union agent locations and in some instances through the Internet or by telephone primarily in the United States, In December 2006, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in Servicio Electr&oacute;nico de Pago S.A., and related entities (SEPSA), a walk in bill payment company based in Argentina with more than 3,300 locations. Prior to the acquisition, we held a 25% interest in SEPSA. Factors that we believe are important to our long term success include international growth by expanding and diversifying our consumer to consumer global distribution network, building our brands, enhancing the consumer experience, expanding the channels by which consumers can send or receive money and diversifying our consumer to consumer service offerings, expanding into new biller and other business and government relationships, and expanding the international presence of our consumer to business offerings. Significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include: Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. We anticipate the demand for money transfer services will be strong as individuals continue to migrate to countries outside of 39 Table of Contents their countries of origin. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our transaction volume. For example, during 2006, the United States to Mexico and United States domestic businesses, and to a lesser extent United States outbound businesses, were adversely impacted by the immigration debate and related activities in the United States. This controversy around the subject of immigration and the changes in the approach of various government entities to the regulation of businesses that employ or sell to immigrants has created fear and distrust among some consumers in the United States. As a result, the frequency of money transfer transactions involving these consumers has decreased and some competitors have lowered prices and foreign exchange spreads in certain markets. These and other issues adversely affected our Mexico and United States domestic businesses, and to a lesser extent our U.S. outbound business in 2006, and we expect them to continue to impact our businesses in the future. Certain actions taken by the State of Arizona with respect to money transfer service providers have added to the uncertainty of some of our consumers. For more discussion on this matter, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Revenue is also impacted by prices charged to the consumer, the amount of money sent, and by changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies, particularly the euro, and the United States dollar. We have made periodic pricing decreases in response to competition and to implement our brand investment strategy, which includes better meeting consumer needs, maximizing market opportunities and strengthening our overall competitive positioning. Pricing decreases generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes. Such pricing decreases have averaged approximately 3% of our annual revenues over the last three years, a trend that is expected to continue. We continue to face robust competition in both our consumer to consumer and consumer to business segments from a variety of money transfer and consumer payment providers. We believe the most significant competitive factors in the consumer to consumer segment relate to brand recognition, distribution network, consumer experience and price and in the consumer to business segment relate to brand recognition, convenience, variety of payment methods and price. Regulation of the money transfer industry is increasing. The number and complexity of regulations around the world and the pace at which regulation is changing are factors that pose significant challenges to our business. We continue to implement policies and programs and adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal requirements, as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services, or the conduct of our business in general. Our activities include dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring programs, government relations and regulatory outreach efforts and support and guidance to the agent network on compliance programs. These efforts increase our costs of doing business. Our consumer to business segment continues to experience a shift in demand in the United States from cash based walk in payment services to lower margin, higher volume growth electronic payment services. Significant Financial and Other Highlights Our spin off from First Data was completed on September 29, 2006. As such, profit and cash flow comparisons with prior year are and will continue to be meaningfully impacted by the fact that, up until September 29, 2006, we were a segment of First Data, while now we are a stand alone company. In particular, interest expense and corporate overhead costs will be higher in the future than they were in the past. Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2006 include: We generated $4,470.2 million in total consolidated revenues and $1,311.4 million in consolidated operating income, resulting in year over year growth of 12% and 3% in total consolidated revenues and operating income, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Consolidated net income during 2006 was $914.0 million, representing a decrease of 1% from 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per share during 2006 were $1.20 and $1.19, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.21 in 2005. We completed 147 million consumer to consumer transactions worldwide, an increase of 24% over 2005. Excluding transactions attributable to Vigo Remittance Corporation, or Vigo, which was acquired in October 2005, consumer to consumer transactions increased 17% in 2006 compared to 2005. We completed 249 million consumer to business transactions, an increase of 16% over 2005. Excluding transactions attributable to SEPSA, consumer to business transactions increased 11% in 2006 compared to 2005. Consolidated cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,108.9 million, representing an increase of 11% from 2005 consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities of $1,002.8 million. The Separation of Western Union from First Data The spin off by First Data of its money transfer and consumer payments business to our company became effective on September 29, 2006 through a distribution of 100% of the common stock of The Western Union Company to the holders of record of First Datas common stock (the Distribution). The Distribution was pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement by which First Data contributed to The Western Union Company the subsidiaries that operated its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real estate. First Data received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion from tax counsel to the effect that the spin off was tax free to the stockholders, First Data and Western Union. First Data distributed all of the shares of Western Union common stock as a dividend on First Data common stock as of the record date for the Distribution. In connection with the spin off, we transferred to First Data approximately $3.5 billion in the form of a combination of cash and our debt securities, which included a dividend paid to First Data in the form of a promissory note from our subsidiary, First Financial Management Corporation, or FFMC, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion, which we subsequently settled through borrowings under a bridge loan facility as part of the Distribution, the issuance of $1.0 billion in Western Union notes, and a cash payment to First Data of $100.0 million, which was financed through borrowings under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that we entered into in connection with the spin off. The bridge loan was paid off in November 2006 through the issuance of a combination of fixed and floating rate notes with maturities ranging between two and 30 years and commercial paper (refer to Capital Resources and Liquidity). The remaining approximately $602 million reflected as a dividend to First Data in our consolidated statements of stockholders (deficiency)/net investment in The Western Union Company was comprised of cash, consideration for an ownership interest held by a First Data subsidiary in one of our agents which had already been reflected as part of our company, settlement of net intercompany receivables (exclusive of certain intercompany notes as described in the following paragraph), and transfers of certain liabilities, net of assets. We also settled certain intercompany notes receivable and payable with First Data along with related interest and currency swap agreements associated with these notes as part of the spin off. The net settlement of the principal and related swaps resulted in a net cash inflow to our cash flows from financing activities of $724.0 million. The net settlement of interest on these notes receivable and payable of $40.7 million was reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. A significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by First Data, such as investment banker fees, outside legal and accounting fees relating to the spin off, office move costs, costs to separate information systems and consulting costs. Western Union incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to our company, including stock compensation expense related to the Distribution, reorganization expenses, and other items such as recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring key senior management positions new to our company, and the consulting costs incurred to develop ongoing processes. 41 Table of Contents Adoption of SFAS No. 123R We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), following the modified prospective method effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires all stock based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their respective grant date fair values over the corresponding service periods and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense, including stock compensation expense allocated by First Data prior to the spin off on September 29, 2006 and the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R, was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. In December 2005, First Data accelerated vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options granted to its officers and employees under its 2002 Long Term Incentive Plan. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce stock based compensation expense that otherwise likely would have been recorded in future periods following First Datas adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We recognized compensation expense of $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to accelerated vesting. Refer to Note 16 Stock Compensation Plans in our historical consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of First Datas and our stock based compensation plans and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Basis of Presentation The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for periods ending on or after the Distribution are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of the Company and our majority owned subsidiaries. The financial statements for the periods presented prior to the Distribution are presented on a combined basis and represent those entities that were ultimately transferred to the Company as part of the spin off. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. The historical statements of income include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to Western Union by First Data, including treasury, tax, accounting and reporting, mergers and acquisitions, risk management, legal, internal audit, procurement, human resources, investor relations and information technology. If possible, these allocations were made on a specific identification basis. Otherwise, the expenses related to services provided to Western Union by First Data were allocated to Western Union based on the relative percentages, as compared to First Datas other businesses, of headcount or other appropriate methods depending on the nature of each item of cost to be allocated. Pursuant to a transition services agreement we entered into with First Data prior to the spin off, First Data is providing Western Union with certain of these services at prices agreed upon by First Data and Western Union for a period of up to one year from the date of the spin off. Western Union has arranged to procure other services pursuant to arrangements with third parties. The costs historically allocated to us by First Data for the services it has provided us may have been lower than the costs we will incur to obtain these services following the spin off. In addition to the transition services agreement, we have entered into a number of commercial agreements with First Data in connection with the spin off, many of which have terms longer than a year. We expect that certain expenses related to being a stand alone company will be higher in the future than the historical amounts reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The financial information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K prior to the spin off date of September 29, 2006 does not reflect what our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Components of Revenue and Expenses The following briefly describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents Transaction fees Transaction fees are charged to consumers for sending money transfers and consumer to business payments. Consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent. Transaction fees represented 83% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, and are most reflective of our performance. Foreign exchange revenue In certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. Foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been driven principally by growth in international cross currency transactions rather than changes to the foreign exchange spread. Foreign exchange revenue represented approximately 15% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Commission and other revenues Commission and other revenues represented approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. Commission and other revenues consist of commissions we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator&reg; program (a recurring mortgage payment service program), revenue recorded for reimbursable costs incurred to operate payment services programs and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets. Cost of services Cost of services includes the costs directly associated with providing services to consumers, including commissions paid to agents and billers, personnel expenses, software maintenance costs, equipment, telecommunications costs, bank fees, infrastructure costs to provide the resources and materials necessary to offer money transfer and other payment services (including reimbursable costs), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, primarily consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses. Prior to September 29, 2006, the date of the spin off, SG&A also includes allocations of general corporate overhead costs from First Data. Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with a loan made to one of our agents. Interest expense Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings payable to third parties. Derivative (losses)/gains, net Derivative gains and losses include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with certain foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under derivative accounting rules prior to September 29, 2006, and the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges entered into on or after September 29, 2006. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our money transfer business, which along with the gains and losses on the revaluation of the related settlement assets and obligations, are reflected in operating expenses. Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net Certain of the notes receivable from First Data in our consolidated balance sheets were repayable in euros, and certain of those euro denominated notes also had foreign currency swap agreements associated with them. These notes receivable were translated based on current exchange rates between the euro and the United States dollar, and changes in fair value of the related foreign currency swap agreements were recorded based on current market valuations. The effect of translation 43 Table of Contents adjustments and recording the foreign currency swaps to market is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data. All notes receivable and payable with First Data were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Interest income from First Data, net Interest income from First Data, net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from First Data, net of interest expense incurred on notes payable to First Data. All notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Other income, net Other income, net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity investments and other income and expenses. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion of our results of operations refers to the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 3,696.6 $ 3,354.8 $ 3,006.1 10 % 12 % Foreign exchange revenue 653.9 531.0 449.6 23 % 18 % Commission and other revenues 119.7 102.1 91.9 17 % 11 % Total revenues 4,470.2 3,987.9 3,547.6 12 % 12 % Expenses: Cost of services 2,430.5 2,118.9 1,859.4 15 % 14 % Selling, general and administrative 728.3 599.8 576.1 21 % 4 % Total expenses 3,158.8 2,718.7 2,435.5 16 % 12 % Operating income 1,311.4 1,269.2 1,112.1 3 % 14 % Other income/(expense): Interest income 40.1 7.6 1.8 * * Interest expense (53.4 ) (1.7 ) (1.7 ) * * Derivative (losses)/gains, net (21.2 ) 45.8 (30.2 ) * * Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net 10.1 (5.9 ) 7.5 * * Interest income from First Data, net 35.7 24.3 9.1 * * Other income, net 12.4 4.8 * * Total other income/(expense), net 23.7 74.9 (13.5 ) * * Income before income taxes 1,335.1 1,344.1 1,098.6 (1 )% 22 % Provision for income taxes 421.1 416.7 347.0 1 % 20 % Net income $ 914.0 $ 927.4 $ 751.6 (1 )% 23 % Basic earnings per share $ 1.20 $ 1.21 $ 0.98 (1 )% 23 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.19 $ 1.21 $ 0.98 (2 )% 23 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenues overview The following provides highlights of revenue growth while a more detailed discussion is included in Segment Discussion: Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue are contributed from our consumer to consumer segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion. Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue grew 12%, 12% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 compared to the previous year, respectively. Increased money transfers at existing agent locations and, to a lesser extent, new agent locations contributed to increased transaction volume and fee revenue for each of 45 Table of Contents those years. Our acquisition of Vigo in October 2005 contributed $140.5 million in total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $24.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. Fluctuations in the exchange ratio between the euro and the United States dollar have resulted in the following benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer revenue over the previous year (which represents over 80% of our consolidated transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue), net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange ratio (in millions): Year ended December 31, Benefit /(Reduction) 2006 $ 11.5 2005 $ (1.4 ) 2004 $ 73.4 On a euro adjusted basis and excluding Vigo, transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue increased 9%, 12% and 11% in 2006, 2005 and 2004 compared to the respective previous year. During 2006, Western Unions business was adversely impacted by the immigration debate and related activities in the United States. This controversy around the subject of immigration and the changes in the approach of various government entities to the regulation of businesses that employ or sell to immigrants has created fear and distrust among some consumers who send money from the United States to other countries, and among some consumers who send money within the United States. As a result, the frequency of money transfer transactions involving these consumers has decreased and some competitors have lowered prices and foreign exchange spreads in certain markets. These and other issues adversely affected our Mexico and United States domestic businesses, and to a lesser extent our U.S. outbound businesses in 2006, and we expect these issues to continue to impact our businesses in the future. Certain actions taken by the State of Arizona with respect to Western Union have added to the uncertainty of some of our consumers. For more discussion on this matter, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 over each respective previous period due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of strong growth in international consumer to consumer transactions and the acquisition of Vigo. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the increase in foreign exchange revenue was partially offset by reduced foreign exchange spreads in selected markets. Commission and other revenues During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, commission and other revenues increased over the previous corresponding period primarily as a result of increased money order commissions due to higher investment income on money orders pending settlement, and higher enrollment fee income due to more customers participating in the Equity Accelerator program. In addition, 2006 commission and other revenue benefited from higher investment income on higher money transfer and payment services settlement asset balances. Operating expenses overview The following provides highlights of our operating expenses: Cost of services Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 54%, 53%, and 52% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 46 Table of Contents The majority of the increase in cost of services in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 was attributable to an increase in agent commissions corresponding to the increase in revenue, and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business, which carries higher cost of services due to higher commission expense compared to our domestic and Mexico businesses which carry lower cost of services. Another factor impacting cost of services as a percent of revenue is the October 2005 acquisition of Vigo, which has higher cost of services compared to Western Union branded money transfers. Higher stock compensation costs in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher employee incentive compensation expense have also contributed to the increase in cost of services as a percent of revenue. The majority of the increase in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 was attributable to an increase in agent commissions corresponding to the increase in revenue. In addition, an $8.7 million impairment charge was recorded in 2005 due to a change in strategic direction related to Eposs Limited, or Eposs, a United Kingdom based seller of cellular prepaid services. We sold our majority interest in Eposs on April 28, 2006. We also recognized an $8.2 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to an additional accrual of domestic and international escheatment liabilities as further discussed in Note 5 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. The year ended December 31, 2005 included lower employee incentive compensation expense compared to 2004 primarily as a result of certain internal performance targets for First Data not being achieved in 2005 whereas all targeted discretionary incentive compensation was paid in 2004. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 due primarily to higher costs incurred in 2006 related to Vigo, increased costs associated with being a stand alone public company discussed below, higher stock compensation expense from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher employee incentive compensation expenses in 2006 compared to 2005. In line with our strategic objective of building the Western Union brand, marketing related expenditures included in operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2006 over the comparable period in 2005 and were approximately 7% of consolidated revenue, a trend that has occurred over the last three years and we expect will continue in the future. Marketing expense includes advertising, events, loyalty programs and employees dedicated to marketing activities. Incremental independent public company expenses of $25 million in 2006 relate to staffing additions and related costs to replace First Data support, corporate governance, information technology, corporate branding and global affairs, benefits and payroll administration, procurement, workforce reorganization, stock compensation, and other expenses related to being a stand alone public company as well as recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring key management positions new to our company, other employee compensation expenses and temporary labor used to develop ongoing processes. These expenses are those in excess of amounts allocated to us by First Data prior to September 29, 2006 or beyond amounts we presume First Data would have allocated subsequently thereto. We expect most of these expenses will continue to be incurred in future periods. SG&A expenses increased for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 due to an increase in marketing related expenses over that in the prior years in line with increases in our revenues. The year ended December 31, 2005 also included lower employee incentive compensation expense compared to 2004 primarily as a result of certain internal performance targets for First Data not being achieved in 2005 whereas all targeted discretionary incentive compensation was paid in 2004. Interest income Interest income increased during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 due to higher international cash balances resulting from the net cash received in connection with the settlement of 47 Table of Contents intercompany notes with First Data (net of certain other payments made to First Data) on the spin off date, and from cash generated through our international operations. Also contributing to higher interest income in 2006 was interest income recorded in connection with a loan for $140.0 million made to one of our agents in the first quarter of 2006. Interest income during the year ended December 31, 2005 also benefited from higher international cash balances generated through our international operations compared to 2004. Interest expense Interest expense increased to $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.7 million during 2005, due to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings that arose in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Interest expense will increase significantly in 2007 since the related borrowings will be outstanding during the full year of 2007 compared to three months during 2006. Derivative (losses)/gains, net Our foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under applicable derivative accounting rules were held primarily in the euro and British pound and have a maturity of one year or less. Prior to September 29, 2006, we did not have any forward contracts that qualified as hedges, and therefore the gains and losses on these contracts were reflected in income prior to that date. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the valuation of these forward contracts were recognized based on variations between foreign currency market exchange rates and the forward contract rates, primarily the euro, which resulted in foreign currency losses in 2006 of $21.2 million, gains of $45.8 million in 2005, and losses of $30.2 million in 2004. On September 29, 2006, we re established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result, on a go forward basis, we anticipate the amounts reflected in this income statement caption will be minimal, and will relate primarily to the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2006, after we re established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for hedge accounting, our foreign exchange gain recognized was $0.6 million compared to a gain of $7.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 when our foreign currency forward contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net The revaluation to fair market value of notes receivable from First Data and the related foreign currency swap arrangements that were denominated in euros benefited income before income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2006 by $10.1 million compared to a reduction to income before income taxes in the corresponding period in 2005 by $5.9 million. For the year ended 2005 compared to 2004, these mark to market valuations resulted in decreased income before income taxes of $13.4 million. Such fluctuations typically correspond to changes in the value of the euro. All notes receivable from First Data, net of notes payable to First Data, and related foreign currency swap agreements were settled in cash in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Accordingly, no such amounts will be recognized in the future. Interest income from First Data, net Interest income from First Data, net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from First Data, partially offset by interest incurred on notes payable to First Data. Interest income from First Data increased for all periods presented through the spin off from First Data on September 29, 2006 due to increased average net borrowings by First Data from Western Union affiliates. As part of the spin off, all remaining notes payable and notes receivable to or from First Data were settled in cash. As a result, no interest income from First Data will be recognized in the future, however, we will earn interest income on our cash balances as described above. 48 Table of Contents Other income, net The increase in Other income, net during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 compared to the previous corresponding years was driven by higher equity earnings from equity method investments. Income taxes Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 32%, 31% and 32% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The effective tax rate over the three periods remained relatively constant, with 2005 benefiting slightly from certain state tax adjustments. We estimate our 2007 tax rate will be approximately 32% based on current facts and circumstances. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003. Our reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. Any difference from our position as recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue will be reflected in our companys income tax expense in the period during which the issue is resolved. Such resolution could also affect our effective tax rate in future periods. To address certain tax aspects of the 2003 restructuring of our international operations, discussions were initiated with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) program. However, we were notified by the IRS in October 2006 that we will not be able to conclude an arrangement acceptable to us through the APA Program. Thus, the tax aspects of the 2003 restructuring will be addressed as part of ongoing federal income tax audits. We have benefited from the 2003 restructuring by having our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates rather than the U.S. and state combined statutory tax rate. The amount of taxes attributable to such rate differential cumulatively totaled $210.8 million through December 31, 2006. Earnings per share During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, basic earnings per share were $1.20, $1.21 and $0.98, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.19, $1.21 and $0.98, respectively. All issued and outstanding shares of Western Union common stock, consisting of 100 shares, were held by First Data prior to September 29, 2006. Accordingly, for all periods presented prior to the spin off which occurred on September 29, 2006, basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using our basic shares outstanding as of the spin off date. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share subsequent to September 29, 2006 reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options on the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. Dilutive shares included in the annual earnings per share calculation going forward will increase as such potentially dilutive shares will be outstanding during the entire periods presented. The repurchase of 0.9 million shares during the year ended December 31, 2006 had an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share. Of the 73.8 million outstanding options to purchase common shares of our company, over 60% of those options are held by employees of First Data. Diluted earnings per share decreased during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the previous year due to decreased net income and the increase in diluted shares outstanding, which was driven by the factors described in the preceding paragraph and because prior to the September 29, 2006 spin off date, there were no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding. Dilutive earnings per share increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to higher net income. 49 Table of Contents Segment Discussion We manage our business around the consumers we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are: Consumer to consumer provides money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for both international cross border transfers that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Consumer to business focuses on payments from consumers to billers through our networks of third party agents and various electronic channels. While we continue to pursue international expansion of our offerings in select markets, as demonstrated by our December 2006 acquisition of SEPSA, substantially all of the segments 2006 revenue was generated in the United States. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other. Also included in Other are recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes in connection with completing the spin off. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the following principles: The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Segment revenue includes intersegment revenue. Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments revenue. Exclude all items not included in operating income. The following table sets forth the different components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

The table below sets forth performance indicators for the consumer to consumer segment for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Years Ended December 31, 2006 2006 (excluding Vigo) 2005 2005(excluding Vigo) 2004 Consumer to consumer transaction growth: International (a) 29 % 24 % 27 % 26 % 24 % Domestic (b) (1 )% (2 )% 5 % 5 % 8 % Mexico (c) 35 % 6 % 28 % 21 % 16 % Consumer to consumer revenue growth: International (a) 17 % 15 % 16 % 15 % 21 % Domestic (b) (3 )% (3 )% 4 % 4 % 8 % Mexico (c) 29 % 7 % 33 % 27 % 6 % (a) Represents transactions between and within foreign countries (excluding Canada and Mexico), transactions originated in the United States or Canada paid in foreign countries and foreign country transactions paid in the United States or Canada.

(b) Represents all transactions between and within the United States and Canada. (c) Represents all transactions to and from Mexico. Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005 was driven by international revenue growth and the acquisition of Vigo, which was completed in October 2005. Vigo contributed $140.5 million and $24.2 million in total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The anniversary date of the acquisition of Vigo occurred in October 2006, which will have an impact on reported revenue growth rates in the future. Excluding Vigo, growth in international consumer to consumer revenue partially offset the slowing of Mexico and domestic revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. During 2006, the United States to Mexico and United States domestic businesses, and to a lesser extent United States outbound businesses, were adversely impacted by the immigration debate and related activities in 51 Table of Contents the United States. This controversy around the subject of immigration and the changes in the approach of various government entities to the regulation of businesses that employ or sell to immigrants has created fear and distrust among some consumers in the United States. As a result, the frequency of money transfer transactions involving these consumers has decreased and some competitors have lowered prices and foreign exchange spreads in certain markets. In 2006, Western Union was also a party in two sets of legal disputes pending in Arizona. The first set concerns the authority of the Arizona Attorney General to request bulk data regarding money transfers sent from states other than Arizona to Sonora, Mexico. The data disputes are still pending. The other dispute concerns the Attorney Generals authority to seize money transfers sent from states other than Arizona to Sonora, Mexico. In early January 2007, an Arizona state court ruled on the latter proceeding, finding that the State of Arizona did not have the authority to seize money transfers sent from states other than Arizona to Sonora, Mexico. In February 2007, the Arizona Attorney General filed an appeal to this ruling. We continue to take measures to address the data disputes and we believe that any impact of these proceedings will not be material to our consumer to consumer business. These and other issues adversely affected our Mexico and United States domestic businesses, and to a lesser extent our U.S. outbound business in 2006, and we expect them to continue to impact our businesses in the future. In response to some of the challenges surrounding the immigration debate and in line with our strategic objective of building the Western Union brand, we have continued to invest in targeted pricing actions taking into account local market and competitive factors. Pricing decreases generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes. Such pricing decreases have averaged approximately 3% of our annual revenues over the last three years, a trend that is expected to continue. International revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 resulted from growth in money transfer transactions and the acquisition of Vigo. International money transfer transaction growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year period was driven most significantly by growth in the United States and European outbound businesses. The key inbound markets of India and China continued to grow, with transactions in India more than doubling and China transaction growth rates exceeding 35% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The international transaction growth rate excluding Vigo for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 24% was directionally consistent with the 26% growth rate for the comparable period in 2005. Although international intra country transaction growth remained strong in 2006, the overall international transaction growth rate during 2006 was impacted by high transaction growth rates experienced in the intra country business in the second half of 2005, particularly in the Philippines. Fluctuations in the exchange ratio between the euro and the United States dollar have resulted in the following benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer revenue over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange ratio (in millions): Year ended December 31, Benefit /(Reduction) 2006 $ 11.5 2005 $ (1.4 ) 2004 $ 73.4 On a euro adjusted basis, international revenue grew 16% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 16% in the comparable period in 2005, with Vigo contributing 2% to the growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2006. The difference between international transaction growth and revenue growth was relatively consistent during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the corresponding period in 2005. The slight increase in the difference between international transaction growth and revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven by Vigo transactions, which have lower revenue per transaction compared to the Western Union branded business. The impact from Vigo transactions was partially offset by the stronger euro compared to 2005, which benefited revenue growth, but not transaction growth. 52 Table of Contents Growth in Mexico money transfer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 was driven by the acquisition of Vigo and growth in Western Union branded transactions, partially offset by a decline in Orlandi Valuta branded transactions. Revenues from Western Union branded U.S. to Mexico transactions increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 26% for the same period in 2005. The decline in revenue growth rates was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate in the United States as described above. Domestic transaction growth rates in the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005 declined compared to increases observed for the year 2005 due in part to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate described above, and broader market softness experienced within the United States domestic business in 2006. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the acquisition of Vigo and an increase in the higher growth international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions. Contributing to the increase in total consumer to consumer money transfer revenue and transaction growth in all periods presented was the growth in transactions at existing agent locations, the number of agent locations and marketing campaigns promoting Western Union services. The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations as new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to revenue growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, often is experienced as locations mature. We believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated versus paid out as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations. Send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and help ensure global distribution. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location, immigration patterns, the locations class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering Western Union services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the nearly 300,000 agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2006, more than 85% of the combined locations in the United States, Canada and Western Europe experienced money transfer activity in the last 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are predominantly receive locations, more than 65% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the last 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions. Consumer to consumer revenue growth in 2005 was driven by growth in consumer to consumer transactions and the acquisition of Vigo in October 2005. International transaction growth benefited from growth in the United States and European outbound businesses and strong growth in China, India and the Philippines, including the Philippines intra country business. Consumer to consumer revenue growth was also impacted by exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the exchange rates between the euro and the United States dollar resulted in a year over year negative impact to revenue of $1.4 million compared to a benefit of $73.4 million in 2004, assuming a constant exchange ratio (i.e., as if there were no change in exchange rates from the same period in the previous year) between the euro and the United States dollar. Changes in exchange rates primarily impact international revenue. On a euro adjusted basis, international revenue growth was 16% and 17% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Growth in Mexico transactions for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven by growth in Western Union branded transactions. The lower transaction and revenue growth rates in domestic money transfer for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 are not attributable to any specific event. The difference between international transaction growth and revenue growth increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the negative currency conversion impact of the euro compared to the benefit in the 53 Table of Contents prior year as noted above, which negatively impacted revenue growth compared to the prior year. Intra country business is incremental to both transactions and revenue but benefited transaction growth more than revenue growth. Consumer to consumer pricing decreases, as a percentage of our total revenue, were consistent from 2004 to 2005. Foreign exchange revenue increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to an increase in the higher growth international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions. In addition, growth in 2005 was impacted by the acquisition of Vigo. Operating income The consumer to consumer segments operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 as a result of the items noted in Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue above. Operating income during the year ended December 31, 2006 was impacted by a variety of other factors including a shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business, which carries lower profit margins than our U.S. to Mexico and domestic businesses, higher stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and a slight operating loss at Vigo. In addition, we incurred incremental costs as a stand alone public company including salaries, benefits, equipment, supplies and other costs incurred in connection with operating departments that were not part of our company prior to the spin off, and are incremental to both costs allocated by First Data prior to the spin off and presumed overhead allocations from First Data had we remained part of First Data through the end of 2006. Increased costs of being a stand alone company also include stock compensation expenses incurred in connection with stock awards granted on the spin off date. Employee incentive compensation expenses in 2006 were higher than in 2005. The cost increases in 2006 described above were partially offset by lower escheatment accruals resulting from charges incurred in 2005 that did not recur in 2006. In line with our strategic objective of building the Western Union brand, marketing related expenditures increased during the year ended December 31, 2006 over the comparable period in 2005. We expect to increase marketing expenditures in 2007 and beyond. Consumer to consumer operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus 2004 due to the increase in revenue, and employee incentive compensation in 2005 compared to 2004, partially offset by higher overhead allocations from First Data. Marketing expenses increased in 2005 and 2004, but remained relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue. Consumer to Business Segment The following table sets forth our consumer to business segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 593.7 $ 565.0 $ 545.4 5 % 4 % Other revenues 42.5 35.2 30.9 21 % 14 % Total revenues $ 636.2 $ 600.2 $ 576.3 6 % 4 % Operating income $ 223.3 $ 220.4 $ 219.5 1 % % Operating margin 35 % 37 % 38 % Key indicators: Consumer to business transactions 249.4 215.1 192.6 16 % 12 % 54 Table of Contents Transaction fees Transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 resulted from strong transaction growth in electronic bill payments driven primarily by our Speedpay&reg; and Equity Accelerator services. The growth rates in 2006 compared to 2005 also benefited from cash bill payments experiencing a slight revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus a decline in 2005. In addition, our Western Union Convenience Pay&reg; or Convenience Pay business benefited from the addition of a large new biller client in the third quarter of 2005 which had a positive impact to transaction and revenue growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Reported transaction growth rates and, to a lesser extent, reported revenue growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2006 were negatively impacted as a result of the anniversary date for the signing of this large biller client occurring in the third quarter of 2005. In December 2006, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in SEPSA. Prior to the acquisition, we held a 25% interest in SEPSA. This acquisition contributed $3.6 million in revenue to our consumer to business segment in the fourth quarter 2006. In 2006, revenue and transaction growth compared to 2005, excluding SEPSA was 5% and 11%, respectively. We expect that SEPSA will continue to benefit revenue and transaction growth rates throughout most of 2007. Transaction fee growth for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was driven by growth in our electronic payment services as well as the new Convenience Pay biller relationship discussed above. Operating income For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income increased at a slower rate than revenue growth over the same period in 2005. The shift in the United States to electronic based products, which have lower operating margins compared to cash based products that have higher operating margins, negatively impacted operating income. Also negatively impacting operating income were increased costs associated with being a stand alone company, stock compensation expenses incurred in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher employee incentive compensation expenses in 2006 than in 2005. The slight increase in operating income from 2004 to 2005 was due to transaction growth, offset by increased corporate overhead allocations from First Data. Recent trends in consumer to business operating margins are impacted by the shift in the United States from cash based services to electronic payment services. Other The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues $ 90.0 $ 113.7 $ 115.6 (21 )% (2 )% Operating income $ 18.4 $ 0.9 $ 6.1 * * * Calculation not meaningful Revenues Our money order and prepaid services businesses accounted for 94%, 70%, and 64% of Other revenue in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. These two businesses are the only businesses classified in Other with expected future recurring revenue. We previously operated internet auction payments, messaging and international prepaid cellular top up businesses, which were shut down or disposed of in 2005 and early 2006. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2006 is due to declines in revenue from such shut down and disposed of businesses while revenues from our money order and prepaid services businesses remained consistent. We do not believe the 55 Table of Contents recent announcement of First Data of its plan to exit its official check and money order business will have a significant impact on us, as First Data has indicated it will honor its contract with us through the initial contract term of 2011. We believe this provides us with adequate time to replace the services currently provided by First Data. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2006, the increase in operating income was driven by the money order business and the elimination of operating losses of the businesses shut down or disposed of primarily in 2006, partially offset by recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes, all in connection with the spin off from First Data. Aggregate operating income/(losses) related to the shut down or disposed of businesses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $0.1 million, $(16.2) million and $(8.2) million, respectively. The decrease in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2005 from the year ended December 31, 2004 was due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2005 of $8.7 million due to a change in strategic direction relating to our majority interest in EPOSS, our international prepaid top up business. Further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Capital Resources and Liquidity Historically, our source of liquidity was cash generated from our operating activities. Cash flows provided from operating activities during 2006 was $1,108.9 million. We expect 2007 cash flows generated from operations to be lower than in 2006 due to significantly higher interest payments and incremental public company expenses as well as other anticipated working capital fluctuations, including the expected payment of fourth quarter accrued United States federal income taxes in the first quarter of 2007. Dividends paid to public stockholders going forward are likely to be significantly less than those previously paid to First Data. Taking into account the above factors, estimated additional annual costs associated with being a stand alone company, projected debt service in 2007, projected capital expenditures and projected stock repurchases, we believe our cash flows will provide us with an adequate source of liquidity to meet the needs of our business. Cash and Cash Equivalents Highly liquid investments (other than those included in Settlement assets) with original maturities of three months or less (that are readily convertible to cash) are considered to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we held $1,421.7 million and $510.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $942.1 million and $186.8 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. The increase in cash and cash equivalents held outside the United States is due to the settlement of notes receivable and payable from and to First Data (net of certain other payments made to First Data) in connection with the spin off. We currently plan to invest these funds through these foreign subsidiaries, as repatriating most of these funds to the United States would result in the incurrence of significant tax obligations. As an integral part of our business, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment processing services sold in advance of settlement with payment recipients. These funds (referred to as Settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets) are not used to support our operations. However, we do have the opportunity to earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments (classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets) to fund settlement obligations. 56 Table of Contents Financing Commercial Paper Program On November 3, 2006, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time prior to the commercial paper program expiration in 2011. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. Our commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2006 were $324.6 million, and had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. At December 31, 2006, $1,175.4 million remained available to borrow under the commercial paper program. Revolving Credit Facility On September 27, 2006, we entered into a five year unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that limit or restrict the ability of our company and its significant subsidiaries to incur debt, collateralize, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of specified assets, or enter into specified sale and leaseback transactions. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant. In connection with the spin off, we borrowed $100 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. This amount was repaid in the fourth quarter. As a result, there were no borrowings or accrued interest under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2006. Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using LIBOR plus an interest rate margin (19 basis points as of December 31, 2006). A facility fee is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage (6 basis points as of December 31, 2006). The facility fee percentage is determined based on our credit rating assigned by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. (Moodys). In addition, to the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate commitments, a utilization fee based upon such ratings is payable to the lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings (5 basis points as of December 31, 2006). Notes On September 29, 2006, we issued to First Data $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016 (the 2016 Notes) in partial consideration for the contribution by First Data to us of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses in connection with the spin off. The 2016 Notes were issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Immediately after the spin off, First Data exchanged the 2016 Notes with two financial institutions for indebtedness of First Data that the financial institutions held at that time. The financial institutions then sold the 2016 Notes in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the subsequent sale of the 2016 Notes. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on a fixed per annum interest rate of 5.930%. The indenture governing the 2016 Notes contains covenants that limit or restrict the ability of our company and other significant subsidiaries to incur debt (in the case of significant subsidiaries), collateralize, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of specified assets, or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. On November 17, 2006, we issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured fixed and floating rate notes, comprised of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the Floating Rate Notes), $1 billion aggregate principal amount notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2036 (the 2036 Notes). The Floating Rate Notes, 2011 Notes, and 2036 Notes were issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 57 Table of Contents We used the net proceeds of the offering of the 2011 Notes, the 2036 Notes, and the Floating Rate Notes, together with the proceeds of approximately $400 million of commercial paper we issued, to repay the entire $2.4 billion in principal amount outstanding under a bridge loan facility entered into by our subsidiary FFMC, described below. This repayment resulted in the release and termination of certain guarantees entered into by FFMC in connection with the spin off relating to our 2016 Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is payable semiannually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on fixed per annum interest rates of 5.400% and 6.200%, respectively. Interest with respect to the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 17, May 17, August 17, and November 17 each year at a per annum rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 15 basis points, reset quarterly (5.52% at December 31, 2006). The indenture governing the 2011 Notes, 2036 Notes and Floating Rate Notes contains covenants that limit or restrict our ability and the ability of our significant subsidiaries to incur debt (in the case of significant subsidiaries), collateralize, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of specified assets, or enter into sale and leaseback transactions. We may redeem the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. We may redeem the Floating Rate Notes at any time on or after May 17, 2007, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest on the date of redemption. In connection with the issuance of the 2011 Notes, the 2016 Notes, the 2036 Notes, and the Floating Rate Notes, we filed a registration statement on Form S 4 with the SEC on December 22, 2006, which provided the holders of the notes an offer to exchange their previously issued notes for identical notes which have been registered. The exchange offer closed on February 6, 2007. Bridge Loan On September 27, 2006, FFMC entered into an unsecured bridge financing facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion (the Bridge Loan) with a syndicate of lenders. On September 29, 2006, FFMC borrowed under the Bridge Loan an aggregate principal amount equal to $2.4 billion in connection with the spin off. The Bridge Loan was repaid on November 17, 2006 with proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes, 2036 Notes, and Floating Rate Notes, together with the proceeds of approximately $400 million of commercial paper we issued, as described above. The following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 914.0 $ 927.4 $ 751.6 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation 34.8 32.0 34.0 Amortization 68.7 47.5 45.2 Deferred income tax provision 12.9 24.9 47.6 Realized (gain)/loss on derivative instruments (4.1 ) 0.5 23.2 Other non cash items, net 47.6 25.8 13.9 Increase/(decrease) in cash, excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions, resulting from changes in: Other assets (60.7 ) (8.8 ) (13.8 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 123.2 (17.9 ) (6.3 ) Other liabilities (27.5 ) (28.6 ) 34.8 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,108.9 $ 1,002.8 $ 930.2 58 Table of Contents Cash from operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 driven by consumer to consumer transaction growth, despite a slight decrease in net income. Net income in the current year was negatively impacted by higher charges to the income statement that did not impact cash flows relating to stock compensation in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2006, higher amortization expense related to higher intangible asset balances in connection with the acquisition of Vigo, and also higher amortization expense as a result of certain large strategic agent contracts being executed earlier in the year for which initial payments were made. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities also benefited from the delay in the payment of accrued income taxes of approximately $70 million related to the fourth quarter of 2006 which will be paid in the first quarter of 2007 due to the Companys spin off from First Data, while income taxes relating to all four quarters in 2005 were paid to First Data during 2005. Cash provided by operations has historically been driven by net income, and increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to consumer to consumer transaction growth as previously discussed. Changes in components of working capital are subject to fluctuations based on the timing of cash transactions related to settlements of certain liabilities. Other non cash items include stock compensation expense, bad debt reserves and other non cash items. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Years Ended December 31, Source (use) (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Capitalization of contract costs $ (124.1 ) $ (22.5 ) $ (7.3 ) Capitalization of software development costs (14.4 ) (7.7 ) (15.7 ) Purchases of property and equipment (63.8 ) (34.8 ) (26.5 ) Notes receivable issued to agents (140.0 ) (8.4 ) Repayments of notes receivable issued to agents 20.0 Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired and contingent purchase consideration paid (66.5 ) (349.1 ) (28.7 ) Cash received/(paid) on maturity of foreign currency forwards 4.1 (0.5 ) (23.2 ) Purchase of equity method investments (5.4 ) (42.0 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (384.7 ) $ (428.4 ) $ (143.4 ) Capital expenditures Total aggregate payments capitalized for purchases of property and equipment, software development and contract costs were $202.3 million, $65.0 million, and $49.5 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Amounts capitalized for contract costs relate to initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts and vary depending on the timing of when new contracts are signed and existing contracts are renewed. In 2006, we purchased an office building and made investments in our information technology infrastructure in connection with being a stand alone company which contributed to the increase in property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, during 2006, we renewed and entered into certain large strategic agent contracts for which initial payments were made that drove the increase in capitalized contract costs. The decrease in software development costs during 2005 compared to 2004 relates primarily to the timing of internally developed software projects. We estimate that capital expenditures in 2007 will be between $200 million and $250 million. Notes receivable issued to agents and repayments of notes receivable issued to agents From time to time, we make advances and loans to agents. In 2006, we signed a six year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a four year loan of $140.0 million to the agent, of which $20.0 million was 59 Table of Contents repaid by the agent during 2006. The terms of the loan agreement require that a percentage of commissions earned by the agent (52% in 2007, 61% in 2008 and 64% in 2009) be withheld by us as repayment of the loan and the agent remains obligated to repay the loan if commissions earned are not sufficient. The loan receivable was recorded in Other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. We impute interest on this below market rate note receivable and have recorded this note net of a discount of $37.8 million as of December 31, 2006. Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired and contingent purchase consideration paid In December 2006, we acquired SEPSA for a total purchase price of $69.5 million, less cash acquired of $3.0 million resulting in a net cash outflow of $66.5 million. During 2005, First Data acquired 100% of Vigo for a total purchase price of $369.2 million, net of cash acquired of $20.1 million resulting in a net cash outflow of $349.1 million. In 2004, contingent consideration payments were made by First Data in connection with the acquisitions of Paymap Inc., or Paymap, and E Commerce Group, Inc., or ECG, during the second quarter of 2002. First Data contributed Vigo, Paymap and ECG to us as part of the spin off. Cash received/(paid) on maturity of foreign currency forwards Amounts received or paid on maturity of our foreign currency forward contracts that do not qualify as hedges in accordance with applicable accounting rules have been classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities. Prior to September 29, 2006, we did not have any forward contracts that qualified as hedges, and accordingly, all realized gains and losses on these contracts have been reflected in investing activities prior to that date. On September 29, 2006, we re established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result, on a go forward basis, we anticipate the amounts reflected in investing activities related to foreign currency forwards will be minimal. Cash received/(paid) on maturity of foreign currency forwards does not include amounts realized on forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our money transfer business, which along with the realized gains and losses on the related settlement assets and obligations, are reflected in operating activities. Purchase of equity method investments In 2004, we purchased 30% interests in two of our international money transfer agents. The aggregate purchase price paid was $42.0 million, net of $5.4 million of holdback reserves to cover claims arising from the acquisitions. The holdback reserves were paid in 2005. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, Source (use) (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Advances from/(to) affiliates of First Data $ 160.2 $ (153.2 ) $ 250.0 Capital contributed by First Data in connection with acquisitions 369.2 28.7 Notes payable issued to First Data 400.1 255.0 Repayments of notes payable to First Data (154.5 ) (246.5 ) (255.0 ) Additions to notes receivable from First Data (7.5 ) (504.7 ) (270.7 ) Proceeds from repayments of notes receivable from First Data 776.2 18.4 Dividends to First Data (2,953.9 ) (417.2 ) (659.8 ) Proceeds from the issuance of borrowings, net of debt issue costs 4,386.0 Principal payments on borrowings (2,400.0 ) Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 324.6 Proceeds from net borrowings under credit facilities 3.0 Proceeds from exercise of options 80.8 Cash dividends to public stockholders (7.7 ) Purchase of treasury shares (19.9 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities $ 187.3 $ (533.9 ) $ (651.8 ) 60 Table of Contents Advances from/(to) affiliates of First Data Prior to the spin off, excess cash generated from our domestic operations that was not required to meet certain regulatory requirements was paid periodically to First Data and was reflected as a receivable from First Data. In addition, First Data and its subsidiaries provided a number of services on behalf of our businesses, including shared services, which were reimbursed periodically. The net payable to and receivable from First Data was a function of the timing of cash sweeps to First Data net of any services First Data and its affiliates had provided. These balances were settled at the time of the spin off as part of the dividend to First Data. Capital contributed by First Data in connection with acquisitions In 2005, Western Union received a contribution of capital from First Data in connection with the acquisition of Vigo. In 2004, First Data contributed capital in connection with contingent consideration payments made by First Data in connection with the acquisitions of Paymap and ECG, both of which were contributed to Western Union as part of the spin off. Notes payable to and receivable from First Data In connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006, funds previously advanced to First Data to finance certain international acquisitions made by First Data were repaid to us in cash. These notes were funded primarily through cash generated from our international operations and notes payable issued to First Data. As part of the spin off, substantially all notes payable and notes receivable to or from affiliates of First Data were settled in cash. In 2005 and 2004, we made advances to First Data in the form of notes of $504.7 million and $270.7 million, respectively, to finance certain international acquisitions made by First Data. These notes were funded primarily through cash generated from our international operations and notes payable issued to First Data with balances of $153.6 million at December 31, 2005. Dividends to First Data In connection with the spin off, FFMC paid a $2.4 billion dividend to First Data in the form of a promissory note that was repaid immediately following the spin off, and we paid an additional $100.0 million to First Data financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility as discussed below. The remaining $453.9 million reflected as a cash dividend was comprised of cash, consideration for an ownership interest held by a First Data subsidiary in one of our agents which had already been reflected as part of our company, and settlement of net intercompany receivables (exclusive of certain intercompany notes discussed above). In 2005 and 2004, we paid dividends to First Data from profit generated through operations. The amount of dividends distributed in each year was impacted by the cash balances available as a result of loans made to affiliates. Proceeds from the issuance of borrowings, net of debt issue costs / principal repayments on borrowings During September 2006, FFMC entered into the Bridge Loan for $2.4 billion, which was refinanced on November 17, 2006 through the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes for $500.0 million, the 2011 Notes for $1.0 billion and the 2036 Notes for $500.0 million, along with approximately $400 million worth of commercial paper borrowings, all of which are described in more detail above under Financing. In addition to the above borrowings, as discussed further in Significant Non Cash Transactions below, we also issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes in connection with the spin off for which we received no cash proceeds. 61 Table of Contents Net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper During November 2006, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. An initial borrowing under the commercial paper program of approximately $400 million was made in connection with the refinancing of the Bridge Loan described above, of which we subsequently repaid $75.4 million by the end of 2006. Proceeds from net borrowings under credit facilities During September 2006, we made an initial borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to $100.0 million in connection with the spin off which was fully repaid prior to December 31, 2006. We also incurred net borrowings of $3.0 million, due January 2, 2007, through a fixed rate promissory note as of December 31, 2006. Proceeds from exercise of options We received $80.8 million in cash proceeds related to the exercise of 5.4 million stock options subsequent to the spin off date of September 29, 2006 through December 31, 2006. More than 80% of the 5.4 million shares exercised related to stock options held by First Data employees. Cash dividends to public stockholders During the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per common share representing $7.7 million which was paid in December 2006. Purchase of treasury shares In September 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock on the open market through December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2006, 0.9 million shares have been repurchased for $19.9 million at an average cost of $22.79 per share. Significant Non Cash Transactions On September 29, 2006, we issued to First Data $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes in partial consideration for the contribution by First Data to us of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses in connection with the spin off. Immediately after the Distribution, First Data exchanged the 2016 Notes with two financial institutions for indebtedness of First Data that the financial institutions held at that time. The financial institutions received the proceeds from the subsequent sale of the 2016 Notes in a private offering. On September 29, 2006, we also issued 765.3 million shares of our common stock to First Data in partial consideration for the contribution by First Data to us of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses in connection with the spin off. First Data then distributed the 765.3 million shares of our common stock to First Datas shareholders. First Data transferred to us our headquarters in Englewood, Colorado and certain other fixed assets with a net book value of $66.5 million, and we transferred to First Data certain investments with a net book value of $20.9 million. We also reclassified liabilities totaling $193.8 million relating to certain tax and employee related obligations from Receivables from First Data, net. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements, we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 62 Table of Contents Pension Plans We have two frozen defined benefit plans that together were underfunded by $52.9 million as of December 31, 2006. In 2006, we did not make a contribution to these plans, and currently do not anticipate contributing to these plans in 2007 since, based on current asset return calculations and minimum funding requirements, no such contribution is required. We do not believe that legislation enacted during 2006 relating to pension plans will have an impact on our funding requirement until at least 2008. During 2008, in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, An Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), the measurement dates for our pension plans will be changed to December 31 from a present measurement date of September 30. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions). Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Borrowings, including interest (a) $ 5,155.3 $ 508.2 $ 812.2 $ 1,282.0 $ 2,552.9 Operating leases 79.3 20.5 26.0 13.1 19.7 Purchase obligations (b) 158.1 42.8 59.8 33.0 22.5 $ 5,392.7 $ 571.5 $ 898.0 $ 1,328.1 $ 2,595.1 (a) We have estimated our interest payments based on i) projected LIBOR rates in calculating interest on commercial paper borrowings and Floating Rate Notes, ii) projected commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout 2007, and the assumption that no such amounts will be outstanding on or after December 31, 2007, and iii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our fixed and floating rate notes. (b) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice, and with or without a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if we do not provide written notification of our intent to terminate the contract. Obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. Other Commercial Commitments We had $55.9 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2006, with expiration dates through 2011, certain of which contain a one year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are held primarily in connection with lease arrangements and agent settlement agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to their expiration in most circumstances. Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. We believe that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include stock based compensation, income taxes, derivative financial instruments and capitalized costs. 63 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires all stock based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their respective grant date fair values over the corresponding service periods and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. We selected the modified prospective method of adoption and straight line amortization of compensation cost over the requisite service period. We currently utilize the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors. While SFAS No. 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial, or lattice model. Based upon the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future, we have determined that we will continue to use the Black Scholes Merton model for option valuation. Option pricing models require us to estimate a number of key valuation inputs including expected volatility, expected dividend yield, expected term and risk free interest rate. The most subjective estimates are the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected term when determining the fair market value of an option granted. Stock based compensation expense, including stock compensation expense allocated by First Data prior to the spin off on September 29, 2006 and the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R, was $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Refer to Note 16 Stock Compensation Plans in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of First Datas and our stock based compensation plans and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Income taxes Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe. Inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items and the realization of certain offsets and credits. In the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items or the realizations of offsets or credits differ from our estimates, we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003. Our reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. Any difference from our position as recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue will be reflected in our income tax expense in the period during which the issue is resolved. Such resolution could also affect our effective tax rate for future periods. To address certain tax aspects of the 2003 restructuring of our international operations, discussions were initiated with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) program. However, we were notified by the IRS in October 2006 that we will not be able to conclude an arrangement acceptable to us through the APA Program. Thus, the tax aspects of the 2003 restructuring will be addressed as part of ongoing federal income tax audits. We have benefited from the 2003 restructuring by having our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates rather than the U.S. and state combined statutory tax rate. The amount of taxes attributable to such rate differential is included in the Foreign rate differential line in the effective rate reconciliation in Note 10 Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements and cumulatively totaled $210.8 million through December 31, 2006. Pursuant to a tax allocation agreement signed in connection with our spin off from First Data, we and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on our respective businesses both prior to and after the spin off. Although 64 Table of Contents we believe that we have appropriately apportioned such taxes between First Data and us through 2006, subsequent adjustments may occur as the tax filings for such years are made with all applicable tax jurisdictions and such filings are finalized. Also under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences (as set forth in the private letter ruling) in connection with the spin off (and certain related transactions) if such transactions do not qualify for tax free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, we may be liable to First Data for all or a portion of any such taxes or liabilities. See Item 1 of Part I. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the spin off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), regarding accounting for, and disclosure of, uncertain income tax positions which is further described in New Accounting Pronouncements, on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires that the cumulative effect of adopting its provisions be reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48, however, we do not expect the effect of adoption to be significant. Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily the euro and British pound, related to forecasted revenues and also on settlement assets and obligations. Additionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in market rates both prior to and subsequent to the issuance of debt. Our policy is to minimize our exposures related to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while prohibiting speculative or market making activities. See Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information on these risk management activities. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one year or less, to mitigate some of the risk related to forecasted revenues, however, during February 2007, we revised certain guidelines and are planning to extend the duration of our foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate these risks. Short term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to three weeks, are utilized to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on settlement assets and settlement obligations between transaction initiation and settlement. Forward starting interest rate swaps were utilized in 2006 to reduce the risk of interest rate fluctuations on forecasted debt issuances. We previously restated our financial statements for certain derivatives originally intended to qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted (SFAS No. 133). On September 29, 2006, we either settled our outstanding derivatives that were determined to not qualify for hedge accounting or offset such derivatives with new derivatives that were not designated as hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As such, the effect of the changes in the fair value of these hedges prior to September 29, 2006 is included in derivative (losses)/gains, net. On September 29, 2006 and during the fourth quarter 2006, we entered into new derivative contracts in accordance with our revised foreign currency derivatives and hedging processes, which were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be marked to market and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. All of our derivative financial instruments with third party institutions in the over the counter markets are in liquid currencies. Changes in fair value of derivatives which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into revenue or interest expense, for foreign currency and debt related hedges, respectively, in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in our consolidated statements of income 65 Table of Contents under the caption derivative (losses)/gains, net. Derivative contracts entered into to reduce the variability related to settlement assets and obligations are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and, as such, changes in their fair value are included in operating expenses consistent with foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the related settlement assets and obligations. The details of each designated hedging relationship are formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows, and effectiveness is continually evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis. We assess the effectiveness of our foreign currency forward contracts, used to mitigate some of the risks related to forecasted revenues, based on changes in the spot rate of the affected currencies. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of our hedges due to changes in interest rate differential between the two currencies are excluded from the measure of effectiveness and recognized immediately. We utilize regression and other statistical analyses in order to assess the effectiveness of our forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge interest rate risk based on anticipated debt issuance dates and the maturity date of the related interest rate swap arrangement by comparing spot and forward swap rates for all possible debt issuance dates within the expected issuance range. Any determined ineffectiveness prior to or at debt issuance is recognized through earnings immediately. The Company terminated all of its forward starting interest rate swaps in November 2006 upon the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes described earlier, by paying cash of approximately $18.6 million to the counterparties. The difference in the actual issuance date and the probable issuance date, as stated in our hedge designation documentation resulted in ineffectiveness of $0.6 million, which was immediately recognized in derivative (losses)/gains, net in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining $18.0 million loss on the hedges is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related notes. When the underlying transaction related to a hedge is no longer considered probable of occurring, the unrealized gain or loss associated with that hedge is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss into income. We have not historically reclassified amounts of unrealized gains or losses on hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss into income as a result of the underlying transaction no longer being considered probable of occurring within that specified time period. Capitalized Costs We capitalize initial payments for new contracts and contract renewals associated with agent contracts and software costs. Capitalization of these costs is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated ongoing future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. We develop software used in providing services. Software development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility of the software has been established. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general use. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. 66 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 requires that the cumulative effect of adopting its provisions be reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48, however, we do not expect the effect of adoption to be significant. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157; however, we do not expect the impact to be significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, An Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). The statement requires employers to recognize the overfunded and underfunded portion of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability, respectively, and any unrecognized gains and losses or prior service costs as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 158 also requires a plans funded status to be measured at the employers fiscal year end. The requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit plan and the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 158 are effective for us as of December 31, 2006. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end is effective for us in 2008. The adoption of the requirements of SFAS No. 158 that became effective on December 31, 2006 did not have a material impact to the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of our company due to the frozen status of our defined benefit pension plans; however, we will change our measurement date from September 30 to December 31 no later than 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on our financial position and results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We provide money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. Foreign exchange risk is managed through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in the agents local currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients. Thus, we 67 Table of Contents generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. In certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency helping to further provide protection against currency fluctuations. Our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions denominated primarily in the euro and British pound. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one year or less, to mitigate some of the risk related to forecasted revenues, however, during February 2007, we revised certain guidelines, and are planning to extend the duration of our foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate these risks. We had historically intended to apply hedge accounting to these derivatives which produced financial statement results that appeared to be consistent with the economics of these transactions. However, based upon an evaluation of our initial hedge documentation, we determined that our hedge documentation was not adequate at the inception of the derivative agreements to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and accordingly, have previously restated our financial statements. As a result, changes in the fair market value of our outstanding derivative instruments, which are impacted primarily by fluctuations in the euro, have been recognized in derivative (losses)/gains, net for all derivatives entered into prior to September 29, 2006. Had these instruments qualified for hedge accounting treatment, the effective portion of the changes to the fair value of our derivative instruments would have been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and would not have directly impacted our net income until such instruments matured. The failure of these instruments to qualify for hedge accounting treatment resulted in volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to September 30, 2006. For example, during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we had pre tax derivative (losses)/gains of $(21.2) million, $45.8 million and $(30.2) million, respectively. On September 29, 2006, we re established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result, on a go forward basis, we anticipate significantly less volatility in our consolidated statements of income. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are denominated would result in a decrease/increase to pretax income of approximately $27 million as of December 31, 2006. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. Interest Rates A portion of our investments are fixed rate interest bearing securities, which may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment services awaiting redemption. We have classified these investments as available for sale within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and accordingly, record these instruments at their fair market value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our total stockholders deficiency on our consolidated balance sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair market value of these securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair market values of the securities. Currently, the majority of our investments are floating interest rate investments. Interest income on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, $500 million of our total $3.3 billion in debt is based on floating interest rates. We revised certain guidelines in February 2007 and are planning, through the use of hedges, to increase the 68 Table of Contents percent of floating rate debt in the future, subject to market conditions. The interest rate on our floating debt is based on LIBOR plus 15 basis points and is reset on a quarterly basis. Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, $324.6 million of our $3.3 billion in borrowings represented commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4% and a weighted average initial term of 17 days. Considering the interest rates associated with our fixed and floating rate debt, as well as the interest rates on our commercial paper, our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006 was approximately 5.7%. A hypothetical uniform 10% increase in interest rates would result in a decrease to pretax income of approximately $4 million annually based on floating rate borrowings that existed on December 31, 2006. The same 10% increase in interest rates, if applied to current yields on our cash and investment balances at December 31, 2006, would result in an offsetting benefit to pre tax income of $6 million annually. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. 69 Table of Contents
