ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors and Forward looking Statements. Overview We are a leading provider of money transfer services, operating in two business segments: Consumer to consumer money transfer services, provided primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for both international transactions that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Consumer to business payment services, which allow consumers to send funds to businesses and other organizations that receive consumer payments, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers and government agencies (all sometimes referred to as billers) through our network of third party agents and various electronic channels. While we continue to pursue international expansion of our offerings in selected markets, as demonstrated by our December 2006 acquisition of Servicio Electronico de Pago S.A. and related entities (SEPSA or Pago F&aacute;cil) in Argentina, the segments revenue was primarily generated in the United States during all periods presented. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other and represented 3% or less of consolidated revenue during the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, and include Western Union branded money orders available through a network of third party agents primarily in the United States and Canada, and prepaid services. Prepaid services include a Western Union branded prepaid MasterCard&reg; card sold through select agents in the United States and the internet, a Western Union branded prepaid Visa&reg; card sold on the internet, and top up services for third parties that allow consumers to pay in advance for mobile phone and other services. Also included in other are recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company, and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes in connection with completing the spin off; and expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer and micro lending services. The consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through an extensive network of agent locations that offer Western Union services around the world. Some of our agent locations only pay out and do not send money. In addition to our agent locations, we are expanding the ability of consumers to send money through other channels, such as our internet site, westernunion.com, and the telephone. Consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through the Western Union&reg; , Orlandi Valuta&reg; and VigoSM brands. The consumer to business service allows consumers to transfer money to a biller. This service is available at many of our Western Union agent locations, primarily in the United States, and through the internet or by telephone. 40 Table of Contents Factors that we believe are important to our long term success include international growth by expanding and diversifying our global distribution network, building our brands and enhancing the consumer experience, expanding the channels by which consumers can send or receive money, and diversifying our consumer to consumer and consumer to business service offerings through new technologies and new services. Significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include: Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. We believe that the demand for money transfer services will be strong as people continue to migrate to other countries for economic and other reasons. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers, the amount of money sent, and by the foreign exchange spreads we set. We intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions, including actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. We continue to face robust competition in both our consumer to consumer and consumer to business segments from a variety of money transfer and consumer payment providers. We believe the most significant competitive factors in the consumer to consumer segment relate to brand recognition, distribution network, consumer experience and price and in the consumer to business segment relate to brand recognition, convenience, speed, variety of payment methods and price. Regulation of the money transfer industry is increasing. The number and complexity of regulations around the world and the pace at which regulation is changing are factors that pose significant challenges to our business. We continue to implement policies and programs and adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal requirements, as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services, or the conduct of our business in general. Our activities include dedicated compliance personnel, training and monitoring programs, government relations and regulatory outreach efforts and support and guidance to the agent network on compliance programs. These efforts increase our costs of doing business. Our consumer to business segment continues to experience a shift in demand in the United States from cash based walk in payment services to lower margin, higher volume growth electronic payment services. Significant Financial and Other Highlights Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2007 include: We generated $4,900.2 million in total consolidated revenues and $1,322.0 million in consolidated operating income, resulting in year over year growth of 10% and 1% in total consolidated revenues and operating income, respectively. Our operating income margin was 27% during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 29% during the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income and operating income margin were impacted by the shift in business mix reflecting stronger growth in the international business, which carries a lower margin than the United States originated businesses, the $22.3 million accelerated non cash stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of First Data as further described in Results of Operations, and $59.1 million of incremental independent public company expenses compared to $25.1 million in 2006. 41 Table of Contents Consolidated net income during 2007 was $857.3 million, representing a decrease of 6% from 2006. Basic and diluted earnings per share during 2007 were $1.13 and $1.11, respectively, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006 of $1.20 and $1.19, respectively. In addition to the factors described above which have negatively impacted operating income during 2007, net income also decreased in 2007 due to higher interest expense in connection with higher outstanding borrowings payable to third parties. We completed 167.7 million consumer to consumer transactions worldwide, representing an increase of 14% over 2006, due primarily to transactions generated outside of the United States. We completed 404.5 million consumer to business transactions, an increase of 62% over 2006. Excluding transactions attributable to Pago F&aacute;cil, which was acquired in December 2006, consumer to business transactions increased 1% in 2007 compared to 2006. Consolidated cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,103.5 million. Cash provided by operating activities remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, despite decreased net income, as some of the decrease to net income was from increased non cash charges which have not impacted cash flows. The Separation of Western Union from First Data On January 26, 2006, the First Data Corporation (First Data) Board of Directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of 100% of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses related assets, through a tax free distribution to First Data shareholders. Effective on September 29, 2006, First Data completed the separation and the distribution of these businesses (the Distribution). Prior to the Distribution, our company had been a segment of First Data. In connection with the spin off, we reported a $4.1 billion dividend to First Data in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity/(deficiency)/net investment in The Western Union Company, consisting of a promissory note from our subsidiary, First Financial Management Corporation, or FFMC, in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion, the issuance of $1.0 billion in Western Union notes and a cash payment to First Data of $100.0 million. The remaining dividend was comprised of cash, consideration for an ownership interest held by a First Data subsidiary in one of our agents which had already been reflected as part of our company, settlement of net intercompany receivables (exclusive of certain intercompany notes as described in the following paragraph), and transfers of certain liabilities, net of assets. We also settled as part of the spin off, certain intercompany notes receivable and payable with First Data along with related interest and currency swap agreements associated with these notes. The net settlement of the principal and related swaps resulted in a net cash inflow to our cash flows from financing activities of $724.0 million. The net settlement of interest on these notes receivable and payable of $40.7 million was reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Basis of Presentation The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for periods ending on or after the Distribution are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our company and its majority owned subsidiaries. The financial statements for the periods presented prior to the Distribution are presented on a combined basis and represent those entities that were ultimately transferred to our company in connection with the spin off. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. The historical consolidated statements of income include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to Western Union by First Data, including treasury, tax, accounting and reporting, mergers and acquisitions, risk management, legal, internal audit, procurement, human resources, investor relations and information technology. If possible, these allocations were made on a specific identification basis. Otherwise, the expenses related to services provided to Western Union by First Data were allocated to Western 42 Table of Contents Union based on the relative percentages, as compared to First Datas other businesses, of headcount or other appropriate methods depending on the nature of each item of cost to be allocated. Pursuant to a transition services agreement we entered into with First Data prior to the spin off, First Data provided Western Union with certain of these services at prices agreed upon by First Data and Western Union. The transition services agreement expired on September 29, 2007. The costs historically allocated to us by First Data for the services provided to us were lower than the costs we have incurred and will continue to incur following the spin off. Certain expenses related to being a stand alone company, reflected in the consolidated statements of income, are higher than the historical amounts prior to the spin off. The financial information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10 K prior to the spin off date of September 29, 2006 does not reflect what our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Adoption of FIN 48 We adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Under FIN 48, we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized an increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits plus associated accrued interest and penalties of $0.6 million, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 8 Income Taxes in our historical consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the adoption of FIN 48. Adoption of FAS 123R We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (SFAS No. 123R), following the modified prospective method effective January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires all stock based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their respective grant date fair market values over the corresponding service periods and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. Stock based compensation expense, including stock compensation expense allocated by First Data prior to the spin off on September 29, 2006 and the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R, was $50.2 million and $30.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 included a $22.3 million accelerated non cash stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of First Data. In December 2005, First Data accelerated vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options granted to its officers and employees under its 2002 Long Term Incentive Plan. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce stock based compensation expense that otherwise likely would have been recorded in future periods following First Datas adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We recognized compensation expense of $1.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to this accelerated vesting. Refer to Note 14 Stock Compensation Plans in our historical consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of First Datas and our stock based compensation plans and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 43 Table of Contents Components of Revenue and Expenses The following briefly describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Transaction fees Transaction fees are charged to consumers for sending money transfers and consumer to business payments. Consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent. Transaction fees represented 81% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, and are most reflective of our performance. Foreign exchange revenue In certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. Foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been driven principally by growth in international cross currency transactions. Foreign exchange revenue represented approximately 16% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Commission and other revenues Commission and other revenues represented approximately 3% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Commission and other revenues consist of commissions we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator&reg; program (a recurring mortgage payment service program), revenue recorded for reimbursable costs incurred to operate payment services programs and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets. Cost of services Cost of services includes the costs directly associated with providing services to consumers, including commissions paid to agents and billers, personnel expenses, software maintenance costs, equipment, telecommunications costs, bank fees, infrastructure costs to provide the resources and materials necessary to offer money transfer and other payment services (including reimbursable costs), depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, primarily consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses. Prior to September 29, 2006, the date of the spin off, SG&A also included allocations of general corporate overhead costs from First Data. Interest expense Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings payable to third parties. Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans made to several agents. Interest income from First Data, net Interest income from First Data, net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from First Data, net of interest expense incurred on notes payable to First Data. All notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Derivative gains/(losses), net Derivative gains and losses include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with certain foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under derivative accounting rules prior to September 29, 2006, and the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges 44 Table of Contents entered into on or after September 29, 2006. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in operating expenses, consistent with exchange rate fluctuations on the related settlement assets, obligations and cash positions. Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net Certain of the notes receivable from First Data in our consolidated balance sheets prior to September 29, 2006, the spin off date, were repayable in euros, and certain of those euro denominated notes also had foreign currency swap agreements associated with them. These notes receivable were translated based on current exchange rates between the euro and the United States dollar, and changes in fair value of the related foreign currency swap agreements were recorded based on current market valuations. The effect of translation adjustments and recording the foreign currency swaps to market is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data. All notes receivable and payable with First Data were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Other income, net Other income, net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity investments and other income and expenses. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following discussion of our results of operations refers to the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 2005 2007vs. 2006 2006vs. 2005 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 3,989.8 $ 3,696.6 $ 3,354.8 8 % 10 % Foreign exchange revenue 771.3 653.9 531.0 18 % 23 % Commission and other revenues 139.1 119.7 102.1 16 % 17 % Total revenues 4,900.2 4,470.2 3,987.9 10 % 12 % Expenses: Cost of services 2,808.4 2,430.5 2,118.9 16 % 15 % Selling, general and administrative 769.8 728.3 599.8 6 % 21 % Total expenses 3,578.2 3,158.8 2,718.7 13 % 16 % Operating income 1,322.0 1,311.4 1,269.2 1 % 3 % Other (expense)/income: Interest income 79.4 40.1 7.6 98 % * Interest expense (189.0 ) (53.4 ) (1.7 ) 254 % * Derivative gains/(losses), net 8.3 (21.2 ) 45.8 * * Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net 10.1 (5.9 ) * * Interest income from First Data, net 35.7 24.3 * 47 % Other income, net 1.7 12.4 4.8 (86 )% 158 % Total other (expense)/income, net (99.6 ) 23.7 74.9 * (68 )% Income before income taxes 1,222.4 1,335.1 1,344.1 (8 )% (1 )% Provision for income taxes 365.1 421.1 416.7 (13 )% 1 % Net income $ 857.3 $ 914.0 $ 927.4 (6 )% (1 )% Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.13 $ 1.20 $ 1.21 (6 )% (1 )% Diluted $ 1.11 $ 1.19 $ 1.21 (7 )% (2 )% Weighted average diluted shares outstanding: Basic 760.2 764.5 763.9 Diluted 772.9 768.6 763.9 * Calculation not meaningful Revenues overview The following provides highlights of revenue growth while a more detailed discussion is included in Segment Discussion: Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue are contributed by our consumer to consumer segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion. Consolidated revenue growth of 10% and 12% 46 Table of Contents during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was driven by revenue growth in our international business (as defined in Segment Discussion) due to increased money transfers at existing agent locations, and to a lesser extent, money transfers at new agent locations. International revenue represented 65%, 62% and 59% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our international consumer to consumer transactions that were originated outside of the United States continued to display strong transaction and revenue growth for all periods presented. Pago F&aacute;cil, which was acquired in December 2006 and is primarily included in our consumer to business segment, contributed $67.7 million and $3.6 million of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our acquisition of Vigo in October 2005 contributed $140.5 million and $24.2 million in total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions of Pago F&aacute;cil and Vigo, consolidated revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the previous corresponding years was 8% and 9%, respectively. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar have resulted in the following benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue (which represents over 80% of our consolidated revenue) over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate: Year ended December 31, (in millions) Benefit /(Reduction) 2007 $ 78.8 2006 $ 11.5 2005 $ (1.4 ) Overall, consolidated revenue increased due to the strong transaction growth in our international business, and due to the impact of the acquisitions and the euro noted above. The revenue growth experienced by our international business was offset by revenue declines in our domestic business (transactions between and within the United States and Canada), and to a lesser extent, the Mexico business during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the corresponding previous periods. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for our United States to Mexico, United States outbound and domestic businesses were adversely impacted by various factors which began in the second quarter of 2006 in the United States, including the immigration debate and subsequent general market softness, in part due to the slow down in the construction industry. Domestic and United States outbound transactions and revenues for money transfers were also impacted by a decline in transactions initiated on our website and on the telephone in the United States during the year ended December 31, 2007. These declines resulted primarily from additional controls implemented beginning in early 2007 by Western Union, card associations and issuing banks in response to credit and debit card fraud. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 over the corresponding previous periods, due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of strong growth in international consumer to consumer transactions. The overall increase in foreign exchange revenue during these periods relating to the increase in cross currency transactions was partially offset by reduced foreign exchange spreads in selected markets. The acquisition of Vigo also contributed to foreign exchange revenue growth in 2006. We have and intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions to reduce fees and foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors. Pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. The costs of such pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions have averaged approximately 3% of our annual consolidated revenue over the last three years. 47 Table of Contents Commission and other revenues During the year ended December 31, 2007, commission and other revenues increased over the previous corresponding period primarily as a result of interest income from higher money transfer and payment services settlement asset balances and higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program. Commission and other revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of higher investment income on money orders pending settlement and higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program. Operating expenses overview Incremental independent public company expenses of $59.1 million and $25.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, are classified within operating expenses under the captions cost of services and selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income. Incremental public company expenses relate to staffing additions and related costs to replace First Data support, corporate governance, information technology, corporate branding and global affairs, benefits and payroll administration, procurement, workforce reorganization, stock compensation, and other expenses related to being a stand alone public company as well as recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring key management positions new to our company, other employee compensation expenses and temporary labor used to develop ongoing processes. These expenses are those in excess of amounts allocated to us by First Data prior to September 29, 2006 or beyond amounts we presume First Data would have allocated subsequently thereto. We expect most of these expenses will continue to be incurred in future periods. At the time of the spin off, First Data converted stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (collectively, stock based awards) of First Data stock held by Western Union and First Data employees. Both Western Union and First Data employees received converted Western Union stock based awards. All converted stock based awards, which had not vested prior to September 24, 2007, are subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the original First Data stock based awards, including change of control provisions which require full vesting upon a change of control of First Data. Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First Data on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR), all of these remaining converted unvested Western Union stock based awards vested. In connection with this accelerated vesting, we incurred a non cash pre tax charge of $22.3 million during the third quarter of 2007. Approximately one third of this charge was recorded within cost of services and two thirds was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Cost of services Cost of services is primarily comprised of agent commissions and also includes expenses for personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services. Cost of services was 57%, 54%, and 53% of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Overall, agent renewals in 2007 resulted in commission rates materially consistent with previous agreements. The majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue in 2007 compared to the corresponding period in 2006 was attributable to the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business, which carries higher cost of services compared to our United States originated businesses. The Pago F&aacute;cil business, which carries a lower margin than our existing consumer to business services, also contributed to the increase in cost of services. The stock compensation charge resulting from the acquisition of First Data by an affiliate of KKR and incremental public company expenses were additional factors leading to the increase in cost of services in 2007, and caused cost of services to increase at a higher rate between 2007 and 2006 compared to the increase in 2006 compared to 2005. 48 Table of Contents The majority of the increase in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 was attributable to the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business, as described above. Another factor impacting cost of services as a percent of revenue was the October 2005 acquisition of Vigo, which has higher cost of services compared to Western Union branded money transfers. Higher stock compensation costs in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher employee incentive compensation expense also contributed to the increase in cost of services as a percent of revenue. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to incremental public company expenses and the stock compensation charge related to KKRs acquisition of First Data, as described above. In addition, costs associated with the inclusion of the Pago F&aacute;cil business contributed to the increase in 2007 from 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due primarily to Vigo, incremental public company expenses, as discussed above, higher stock compensation expense from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and higher employee incentive compensation expenses in 2006 compared to 2005. Marketing related expenditures, principally classified within selling, general and administrative expenses, increased during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior years. However, marketing related expenditures as a percent of consolidated revenue were approximately 6.0%, 6.5% and 6.9% during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Marketing related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for pricing adjustments and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments. For further discussion regarding the impact of pricing decreases refer to the Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue discussion within the consumer to consumer segment section. Interest income Interest income increased during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to corresponding periods in the prior years due to higher international cash balances resulting from the net cash received in connection with the settlement of intercompany notes with First Data (net of certain other payments made to First Data) on the spin off date, and from cash generated through our international operations. Also contributing to higher interest income in 2007 and 2006 was interest income recorded in connection with a $140.0 million loan made to one of our agents in the first quarter of 2006. Interest expense Interest expense increased to $189.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $53.4 million during 2006, due to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings that arose in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Interest expense was significantly higher in 2007 since the related borrowings were outstanding for the full year 2007 compared to three months during 2006. Derivative gains/(losses), net Our foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under applicable derivative accounting rules were held primarily in the euro and British pound and had maturities of one year or less. Prior to September 29, 2006, we did not have any forward contracts that qualified as hedges, and therefore the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts were reflected within this line item in the consolidated statements of income prior to that date. Since these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, there was resulting 49 Table of Contents volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to September 29, 2006. For example, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had pre tax derivative (losses)/gains of $(21.2) million and $45.8 million, respectively. On September 29, 2006, we established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. We anticipate the amounts reflected in this income statement caption going forward will be minimal, as such amounts will relate primarily to the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges. Foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from First Data, net All euro denominated notes receivable with First Data, and related foreign currency swap agreements were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006. Accordingly, no amounts related to the revaluation of such notes or related swaps were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007, explaining the decrease from the year ended December 31, 2006. No such amounts will be recognized in future periods. Prior to the spin off, the revaluation to fair market value of these euro denominated notes receivable from First Data and the related foreign currency swap arrangements benefited income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006 by $10.1 million compared to a reduction to income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $5.9 million. Such fluctuations corresponded to changes in the value of the euro. Interest income from First Data, net Interest income from First Data, net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from First Data, partially offset by interest incurred on notes payable to First Data. All notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on September 29, 2006, and accordingly, no such amounts were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest income from First Data, net increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increased average net borrowings by First Data from Western Union affiliates. Other income, net Changes in other income, net during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the previous corresponding years were primarily attributable to fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments. Income taxes Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 29.9%, 31.5% and 31.0% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate over the three periods remained relatively constant. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of a higher proportion of foreign derived profits compared to United States derived profits (our foreign derived profits are taxed at lower rates than our United States derived profits) and the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in 2003, whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of $276.2 million, including accrued interest and penalties. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from 50 Table of Contents material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. Earnings per share During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, basic earnings per share were $1.13, $1.20 and $1.21, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.11, $1.19 and $1.21, respectively. All issued and outstanding shares of Western Union common stock until the spin off on September 29, 2006, consisting of 100 shares, were held by First Data. Accordingly, for all periods presented prior to the spin off date of September 29, 2006, basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using our basic shares outstanding as of the spin off date. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share subsequent to September 29, 2006 reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options on the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were 10.4 million and 4.9 million, respectively, outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect is anti dilutive. The treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise price of stock options, the unamortized compensation expense and assumed tax benefits are available to reduce the dilutive effect upon exercise. Of the 59.4 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2007, approximately 58% are held by employees of First Data. Diluted earnings per share decreased during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 compared to the previous periods due to the decrease in net income as a result of the previously described factors and the increase in diluted shares outstanding, because, as described above, prior to the September 29, 2006 spin off date, there were no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding. Accordingly, the potentially dilutive shares arising in connection with the spin off had no impact to 2005 and minimal impact to 2006 due to the impact of weighting. In 2007, the dilutive shares outstanding were outstanding for a full year. Segment Discussion We manage our business around the consumers we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are: Consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for both international cross border transfers that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Consumer to business the processing of payments from consumers to billers through our networks of third party agents and various electronic channels. The segments revenue was primarily generated in the United States for all periods presented. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other. In 2007 and 2006, Other also included recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company, and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes in connection with completing the spin off; and expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer and micro lending services. 51 Table of Contents The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the following principles: The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments revenue. All items not included in operating income are excluded. The following table sets forth the different components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The table below sets forth performance indicators for the consumer to consumer segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2006(excluding Vigo) 2005 2005(excluding Vigo) Consumer to consumer transaction growth/(decline): International (a) 20 % 29 % 24 % 27 % 26 % Domestic (b) (4 )% (1 )% (2 )% 5 % 5 % Mexico (c) 4 % 35 % 6 % 28 % 21 % Consumer to consumer revenue growth/(decline): International (a) 15 % 17 % 15 % 16 % 15 % Domestic (b) (10 )% (3 )% (3 )% 4 % 4 % Mexico (c) (4 )% 29 % 7 % 33 % 27 % 52 Table of Contents (a) Represents transactions between and within foreign countries (excluding Canada and Mexico), transactions originated in the United States or Canada and paid elsewhere, and transactions originated outside the United States or Canada and paid in the United States or Canada.

(b) Represents all transactions between and within the United States and Canada. (c) Represents all transactions to and from Mexico. Revenues 2007 compared to 2006 The primary driver of consumer to consumer revenue growth are transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue. Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth of 9% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006 was driven by our international business. However, the growth experienced by our international business has been partially offset by revenue declines in our domestic and Mexico businesses in 2007. International revenue growth of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the corresponding period in 2006, resulted from a 20% increase in volume of international money transfer transactions. Our international transactions that were originated outside of the United States also continued to display strong transaction and revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2007. The key strategic inbound markets of India and China continued to grow, with revenue growth of 44% and 37%, respectively, on transaction growth of approximately 75% and 25%, respectively, and these two markets combined represented approximately 5% of Western Union consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar have resulted in benefits of $78.8 million and $11.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, over the previous year. These benefits to consumer to consumer revenue would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate, and was net of the impact of our foreign currency hedges. The United States to Mexico, United States domestic and the United States outbound businesses were adversely impacted by various factors in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2007. These factors, which began in the second quarter 2006 and are discussed in more detail below, include the immigration debate, and market softness, in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry. We responded to these factors by launching distribution, pricing, advertising, promotion and community outreach initiatives. We have not seen transaction and revenue growth rates return to levels prior to 2006. We believe this is due primarily to market softness in the United States, in part due to a slow down in the construction industry. Although domestic transactions decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the corresponding period in 2006, due primarily to the factors described above and the decline in transactions initiated on our website and through the telephone, as described below, the decline in domestic transactions began to moderate during each sequential quarter in 2007. Domestic revenue declined at a higher rate than transactions, due in part to the impact of price decreases and lower principal amounts sent. Transactions and revenues for money transfers initiated on our website and through the telephone declined for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. Transactions initiated in the United States have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, impacted by tightened controls implemented beginning in early 2007 by Western Union, card issuing banks and card associations in response to credit and debit card fraud in the United States. These tightened controls have directly impacted our consumers ability to use their debit and credit cards to send money on our website and through the telephone, decreasing the volume of transactions. 53 Table of Contents Card issuing banks and card associations have begun to allow more consumer transactions to be processed, in part in response to Western Unions own increased scrutiny of these transactions. However, we anticipate transaction growth will continue to be impacted by these factors and consumer perceptions of their ability to transact on the website and through the telephone as a result of the additional controls that have been implemented. While Mexico transactions grew for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue declined due to price reductions taken in early 2007. However, Mexico revenue and transaction growth rates began to converge during each sequential quarter in 2007 as there were no significant pricing reductions after the early part of 2007. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in the international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions, partially offset by reduced foreign exchange rate spreads in selected markets. We have and intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions, including actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors. Pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. Such overall pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions have averaged approximately 3% of our annual consolidated revenue over the last three years, a trend that is expected to continue. Contributing to the increase in total consumer to consumer money transfer revenue and transaction growth in all periods presented was the growth in transactions at existing agent locations, the increased number of agent locations and marketing campaigns promoting Western Union services. The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to revenue growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations. Send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location, immigration patterns, the locations class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the more than 335,000 agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2007, more than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and western Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer brands) experienced money transfer activity in the last 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are predominantly receive locations, more than 65% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the last 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions. 2006 compared to 2005 Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005 was driven by international revenue growth and the acquisition of Vigo, which was completed in October 2005. Vigo contributed $140.5 million and $24.2 million in total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This revenue growth was offset by declines in our domestic businesses and a slow down in revenue growth in our Mexico business, both of which began in the second quarter of 2006. 54 Table of Contents International revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 resulted from growth in money transfer transactions and the acquisition of Vigo. International money transfer transaction growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the prior year period was driven most significantly by growth in the United States and European outbound businesses. The international transaction growth rate excluding Vigo for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 24% and was directionally consistent with the 26% growth rate for the comparable period in 2005. Although international intra country transaction growth remained strong in 2006, the overall international transaction growth rate during 2006 was impacted by high transaction growth rates experienced in the intra country business in the second half of 2005, particularly in the Philippines. The key inbound markets of India and China continued to grow, with transactions in India more than doubling and China transaction growth rates exceeding 35% for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, India and China combined represented approximately 4% of Western Union consolidated revenues. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar have resulted in a benefit or (reduction) to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of $11.5 million and $(1.4) million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, over the previous corresponding year. This benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer revenue would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate, and was net of the impact of our foreign currency hedges. The relationship between international transaction growth and revenue growth was relatively consistent during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the corresponding period in 2005. Transactions related to Vigo, which have lower revenue per transaction compared to the Western Union branded business, benefited transactions more than revenue. Offsetting this impact was the benefit to revenue from the euro described above, which did not have a corresponding benefit to transactions compared to 2005. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 for our United States to Mexico, United States outbound and domestic businesses was adversely impacted by various factors in the United States, including the immigration debate, which raised concerns with certain consumers in the United States and decreased the frequency of money transfers from the United States to Mexico and other countries. These concerns, together with general market softness, in part due to the slow down in the construction industry, led some competitors to lower fees and reduce foreign exchange spreads in certain markets. In 2006, Western Union was also impacted by the actions of the Office of Attorney General in the State of Arizona which also may have added to the uncertainty with some of our consumers. The Arizona Attorney General seized money transfers initiated in Arizona during certain periods in 2006, and, in September 2006, sought to seize money transfers originated in other states and intended for payment in certain areas of Mexico. Western Union obtained an injunction preventing such seizures, and the Arizona Attorney General has appealed that injunction. Furthermore, the Arizona Attorney General sought personal information about a large number of Western Union customers outside of Arizona, which efforts Western Union has resisted in court. We believe that these events and the publicity they created led some consumers to avoid Western Unions services in late 2006 and early 2007. Western Union remains in litigation with the Arizona Attorney General on these matters. We believe that our legal position is sound, and the publicity surrounding these matters has largely abated. Domestic transaction growth rates in the year ended December 31, 2006 over the same period in 2005 declined compared to increases observed for the year 2005 due in part to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate described above, and broader market softness experienced within the United States domestic business in 2006. Growth in Mexico money transfer transactions for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 was driven by the acquisition of Vigo and growth in Western Union branded transactions. The 55 Table of Contents decline in revenue growth rates was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate in the United States as described above. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the acquisition of Vigo and an increase in the higher growth international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions. Operating income The consumer to consumer segments operating income increased by 1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the corresponding period in 2006. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue in our international business. Operating income during the year ended December 31, 2007 was impacted by the ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business, which carries lower profit margins than in our United States originated businesses. However, we have been experiencing a convergence between international operating profit margins and profit margins of our United States originated businesses. Operating income during the year ended December 31, 2007 was adversely impacted by incremental public company expenses which are incremental to both costs allocated by First Data prior to the spin off and presumed overhead allocations from First Data had we remained part of First Data. Such incremental public company expenses include salaries, benefits, equipment, supplies and other costs incurred in connection with operating as a separate public company. In addition, we recognized an accelerated non cash stock compensation charge of $22.3 million taken in connection with the change in control of First Data, of which 85% was allocated to the consumer to consumer segment. The consumer to consumer segments operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due to an increase in revenue and by lower escheatment accruals resulting from charges incurred in 2005 that did not recur in 2006. These benefits to operating income during the year ended December 31, 2006 were partially offset by the ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business, and incremental public company expenses as discussed above. In addition, we incurred higher employee incentive compensation expenses, including those incurred in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Consumer to Business Segment The following table sets forth our consumer to business segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007vs. 2006 2006vs. 2005 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 665.5 $ 593.7 $ 565.0 12 % 5 % Other revenues 54.4 42.5 35.2 28 % 21 % Total revenues $ 719.9 $ 636.2 $ 600.2 13 % 6 % Operating income $ 223.7 $ 223.3 $ 220.4 1 % Operating margin 31 % 35 % 37 % Key indicators: Consumer to business transactions 404.5 249.4 215.1 62 % 16 % 56 Table of Contents Revenues 2007 compared to 2006 Transaction growth of 62% and revenue growth of 13% in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily resulted from the acquisition of Pago F&aacute;cil and growth in electronic bill payments, partially offset by slight declines in United States cash based bill payments due to the continued shift in the United States to electronic based bill payments. In December 2006, we acquired the remaining 75% interest in Pago F&aacute;cil. Prior to the acquisition, we held a 25% interest in Pago F&aacute;cil. This acquisition contributed $67.7 million and $3.6 million in revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $64.4 million and $3.6 million related to our consumer to business segment in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, excluding Pago F&aacute;cil, was 4%. Transaction growth, excluding Pago F&aacute;cil, was 1% during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, other consumer to business segment revenue increased compared to the corresponding period in 2006 due to higher investment income on settlement asset balances as well as higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program. 2006 compared to 2005 Transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 also resulted from strong transaction growth in electronic bill payments, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Pago F&aacute;cil described above. The growth rates in 2006 compared to 2005 also benefited from cash bill payments experiencing a slight revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus a decline in 2005 as our Western Union Convenience Pay&reg; or Convenience Pay business benefited from the addition of a large new biller client in the third quarter of 2005 which had a positive impact to transaction and revenue growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. Other consumer to business segment revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program, and higher investment income on settlement asset balances. Operating income Operating income for the consumer to business segment was unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 because of the impact of Pago F&aacute;cil and revenue growth in the segments electronic based services businesses, and was offset by incremental public company expenses and the accelerated stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of First Data. Operating income for the period grew at a lower rate than revenues as Pago F&aacute;cil and the electronic based services have lower operating margins compared to those in the segments other services, as well as the incremental public company expenses and accelerated stock compensation charge noted above. For the year ended December 31, 2006, operating income increased at a slower rate than revenue growth over the same period in 2005. The shift in the United States to electronic based products, as discussed above, negatively impacted operating income. Also negatively impacting operating income were incremental public company expenses, stock compensation expenses incurred in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher employee incentive compensation expenses in 2006 than in 2005. 57 Table of Contents Other The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Years Ended December 31, % Change (in millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007vs. 2006 2006vs. 2005 Revenues $ 87.2 $ 89.1 $ 108.5 (2 )% (18 )% Operating income $ 20.0 $ 18.4 $ 0.9 9 % * Operating income margin 23 % 21 % 1 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenues Our money order and prepaid services businesses, including prepaid services acquired through our acquisition of Pago F&aacute;cil, accounted for 100%, 94% and 70% of Other revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We previously operated internet auction payments, messaging and international prepaid cellular top up businesses, which were shut down or disposed of in 2005 and early 2006. Revenue remained relatively constant for the year ended December 31, 2007, due to moderate growth in our money order and prepaid services businesses, offset by the loss of revenue from our shut down or disposed of businesses, which generated revenue for a portion of 2006, while none of those businesses generated revenue in 2007. The decline in revenue for these shut down businesses also contributed to the decrease in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 as these businesses contributed to the entire year in 2005, but only a portion of the year in 2006. First Data, through its subsidiary Integrated Payment Systems, issues our Western Union branded money orders. We do not believe First Datas announcement of its plan to exit its official check and money order business will have a significant impact on us, as First Data has a money order processing contract with us through 2011. We believe we have adequate time to replace the services currently provided by First Data. Operating Income For the year ended December 31, 2007, the increase in operating income was driven by modest growth from our prepaid services. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the increase in operating income was driven by the money order business and the elimination of operating losses of the businesses shut down or disposed of primarily in 2006, partially offset by recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes, all in connection with the spin off from First Data. Aggregate operating income related to the shut down or disposed of businesses, including a gain on the sale of assets related to our internet auction payments business, for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.1 million. The aggregate operating loss associated with such businesses in the year ended December 31, 2005 was $(16.2) million. Further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, driven primarily from net income, and also impacted by fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, timing of income tax payments, and collections on receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarter which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters, and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarter. 58 Table of Contents Our future cash flows generated from operating activities could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant population, and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits. A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash flows generated to the parent company for general corporate use, except for (a) cash balances related to foreign earnings which have been taxed at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined United States federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely; (b) assets located in countries outside of the United States containing legal or regulatory restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries; and (c) cash and investment balances that are maintained by regulated subsidiaries to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the United States in accordance with applicable state regulations in the United States. Significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, we have cash and cash equivalents of $1,793.1 million. We also have a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available to meet additional short term liquidity needs that might arise, and available to support borrowings under our commercial paper program. Taking into account our projected share repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures, and debt service during 2008, we believe our cash flows generated from operating activities and available financing sources will provide us with an adequate source of liquidity to meet the needs of our business. Cash and Investment Securities Our foreign entities held $1,121.7 million and $942.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We currently plan to invest the majority of these funds through these foreign entities. Repatriating these funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We expect to use these funds in expanding our international operations and acquiring businesses overseas. We expect to receive and hold funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle with payment recipients. These funds, referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations. A portion of our settlement assets are held in investment securities, substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt instruments, totaling $193.8 million and $154.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Most state regulators in the United States require us to maintain specific high quality, investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations. We do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes, and all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, which is based primarily on market quotations. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments. As of December 31, 2007, substantially all of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. The credit quality of the majority of our investment portfolio was AAA. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2007, no individual security represented more than 10% of our investment securities portfolio. 59 Table of Contents The third party issuer of Western Union branded money orders holds the settlement assets generated from the sale of Western Union money orders, and maintains the responsibility for investing those funds. Based on the terms of the contract with the issuer, we are provided with a fixed rate of return on the funds awaiting settlement. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $1,103.5 million and $1,108.9 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities was consistent between 2007 and 2006, despite decreased net income. The decrease in net income was, in part, due to increased non cash charges which did not decrease cash flows. Cash flows from operating activities also benefited from favorable working capital fluctuations in 2007. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,108.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1,002.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 driven by consumer to consumer transaction growth, despite a slight decrease in net income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by higher non cash charges that did not impact cash flows relating to stock compensation in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in 2006, higher amortization expense related to higher intangible asset balances in connection with the acquisition of Vigo, and also higher amortization expense as a result of certain large strategic agent contracts being executed earlier in the year for which initial payments were made. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities also benefited from the delay in the payment of accrued income taxes from 2006 to 2007 discussed above, while income taxes relating to all four quarters in 2005 were paid to First Data during 2005. Financing Resources As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have the following outstanding borrowings (in millions): 2007 2006 Due in less than one year: Commercial paper $ 338.2 $ 324.6 Note payable, due January 2007 3.0 Floating rate notes, due 2008 500.0 Due in greater than one year: Floating rate notes, due 2008 500.0 5.400% notes, net of discount, due 2011 (a) 1,002.8 999.0 5.930% notes, net of discount, due 2016 999.7 999.7 6.200% notes, net of discount, due 2036 497.3 497.2 Total borrowings $ 3,338.0 $ 3,323.5 (a) Includes the fair market value of $3.6 million relating to an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $75.0 million. Commercial Paper Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. Our commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2007 and 2006 had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5% and 5.4% and a weighted average initial term of 36 days and 17 days, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility Our revolving credit facility expires in 2012 and includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using LIBOR plus an interest rate margin (19 basis points as of December 31, 2007 and 2006). A facility fee is payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage (6 basis points as of December 31, 2007 and 2006). The facility fee percentage is determined based on our credit rating assigned by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) and or Moodys Investor Services, Inc. (Moodys). In addition, to the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate commitments, a utilization fee based upon such ratings is payable to the lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings (5 basis points as of December 31, 2007 and 2006). As of December 31, 2007, we had no outstanding borrowings and had approximately $1.2 billion available for borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our revolving credit facility is used to provide general liquidity for the Company and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short term credit rating. If the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased, or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted. Amounts available to borrow under this facility are limited by outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Notes On September 29, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016 (the 2016 Notes). Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. On November 17, 2006, we issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured fixed and floating rate notes, comprised of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the Floating Rate Notes), $1 billion aggregate principal amount notes due 2011 (the 2011 Notes) and $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes due 2036 (the 2036 Notes). In June 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $75.0 million to effectively change the characteristic of our interest rate payments on a portion of our 2011 Notes from fixed rate payments to short term LIBOR based variable rate payments in order to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio. The rate on the floating portion of the swap resets every three months based on the three month LIBOR. Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 17 and November 17 each year. Interest with respect to the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 17, May 17, August 17, and November 17 each year at a per annum rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 15 basis points, reset quarterly (5.06% and 5.52% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively). We may redeem the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. We may redeem the Floating Rate Notes at any time on or after May 17, 2007, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest on the date of redemption. Debt Service Requirements Our 2008 debt service requirements will include payments on existing borrowings and any future borrowings under our commercial paper program, the payment due on the maturity of our $500 million Floating Rate Notes in 2008 and interest payments. We have the ability to use existing financing sources, such as our 61 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program, to meet debt obligations as they arise. Currently we intend to refinance our Floating Rate Notes in 2008 with new financing sources, depending on market conditions. Additionally, we may convert a portion of our commercial paper program into longer term borrowings in 2008. Based on market conditions at the time such re financings occur, we may not be able to obtain new financings under similar conditions as historically reported. As discussed in Cash and Investment Securities above, a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2007 is held by foreign entities, some of which has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We currently plan to invest such funds through these foreign entities. However, if we change our plans or are required to change our plans in order to use these cash and cash equivalents for debt service, we would incur significant tax obligations. Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and overall business risks. Our Revolving Credit Facility contains a facility fee and a utilization fee, determined based on our credit rating assigned by S&P and or Moodys, as further described above. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2007: December 31, 2007 S&P Moodys Fitch Short term rating A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured A A3 A Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A significant downgrade or an indication that a significant downgrade may occur could result in the following: Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated; Our borrowing costs on certain existing borrowings would increase; We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings; Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease; Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and Our agent relationships may be adversely impacted, particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices. The indenture governing our notes and the Revolving Credit Facility all contain covenants which, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to grant certain types of security interests, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined 62 Table of Contents in the agreement, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 8:1 as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we are in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow, and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes. Cash Priorities Capital Expenditures Total aggregate amount capitalized for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $192.1 million in 2007. Amounts capitalized for new and renewed agent contracts were $80.9 million during the year. Such contract costs will vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of when new contracts are signed or renewed. Other capital expenditures during 2007 included purchased and developed software costs and purchases of property and equipment representing investments in our information technology infrastructure and the renovation of certain facilities. Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired In December 2006, we acquired Pago F&aacute;cil for a total purchase price of $69.8 million, less cash acquired of $3.0 million. During 2005, First Data acquired 100% of Vigo, which was later transferred to us as part of the spin off, for a total purchase price of $369.2 million, net of cash acquired of $20.1 million resulting in a net cash outflow of $349.1 million. We expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies, particularly outside of the United States, that complement our existing businesses worldwide. Return Value to Shareholders through Share Repurchases and Dividends We have two programs which allow us to repurchase shares. In September 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2008. In December, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, 35.6 million shares have been repurchased for $746.7 million at an average cost of $20.98 per share. As of December 31, 2007, $1.25 billion remains available under these two programs. During the fourth quarter of 2007, our Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share, representing $30.0 million, which was paid in December 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.01 per common share, representing $7.7 million, which was paid in December 2006. Equity investments in and loans to certain key agents In October 2007, we entered into agreements totaling $18.3 million to convert our non participating interest in a joint venture with our Singapore agent, Hersing Corporation Ltd., into a fully participating 49% equity interest and extended the agent relationship at more favorable commission rates to Western Union. As a result, we will now earn a pro rata share of profits and will have enhanced voting rights. We also have the right to add additional agent relationships in Singapore under this agreement. Also in October 2007, we completed an agreement to acquire a 25% ownership interest in GraceKennedy Money Services Caribbean SRL (GraceKennedy), an agent in Jamaica (which also acts as our agent in several other Caribbean countries), and to extend the term of the agent relationship for $29.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid resulted in $20.2 million of identifiable intangible assets, which are being amortized over seven to 10 years. 63 Table of Contents From time to time, we also make advances and loans to agents. Most significantly, in the first quarter 2006, we signed a six year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a four year loan of $140.0 million to the agent, of which $30.0 million and $20.0 million was repaid in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The terms of the loan agreement require that a percentage of commissions earned by the agent (61% in 2008 and 64% in 2009) be withheld as repayment of the loan and the agent remains obligated to repay the loan if commissions earned are not sufficient. The remaining loan receivable balance relating to this agent as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, net of discount, was $67.5 million and $82.2 million, respectively. As opportunities arise, we expect we will continue to strategically invest in agents to further strengthen our business. Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchases will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy. Prior to Spin Off from First Data Prior to the spin off, excess cash generated from our domestic operations that was not required to meet certain regulatory requirements was periodically advanced to First Data and was reflected as a receivable from First Data. In addition, we periodically paid dividends to First Data. First Data and its subsidiaries provided a number of services on behalf of our business, including shared services, which were reimbursed periodically. Also, when we were a segment of First Data, we benefited from First Datas financing resources. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Pension Plans We have two frozen defined benefit plans that together were underfunded by $27.6 million as of December 31, 2007. During the period from 2005 to 2007, we did not make a contribution to these plans, and based on current asset return calculations and minimum funding requirements, no such contribution is required in 2008. The measurement date for our pension plans is September 30. Thus, during the third quarter of each year, management reviews and, if necessary, adjusts the assumptions associated with its pension plans. During 2008, in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, An Amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), the measurement dates for our pension plans will be changed to December 31. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions: 1) expected long term return on plan assets; and 2) discount rate. Our expected long term return on plan assets was 7.50% for 2007 and 2006. If actual asset returns exceed the expected return on plan assets by 100 basis points, the plans funded status would improve by $4 million. The discount rate assumption for the companys benefit obligation was 6.02% and 5.61% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. A 100 basis point change in 64 Table of Contents the discount rate would change the funded status by $33 million. Due to the frozen status of our plans, a 100 basis point change in these assumptions would not be significant to the net periodic benefit income or expense of our plans. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions). Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Borrowings, including interest (a) $ 4,986.3 $ 1,010.4 $ 286.1 $ 1,230.2 $ 2,459.6 Purchase obligations (b) 126.1 50.2 42.9 33.0 Foreign currency forward contracts (c) 37.2 28.8 8.4 Operating leases 85.1 22.7 26.8 16.1 19.5 Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 276.2 Capitalized contract costs (e) 14.3 14.1 0.2 Estimated pension funding (f) 27.6 15.0 12.6 $ 5,552.8 $ 1,126.2 $ 379.4 $ 1,291.9 $ 2,479.1 (a) We have estimated our interest payments based on i) projected LIBOR rates in calculating interest on commercial paper borrowings and Floating Rate Notes, ii) projected commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout 2008, and the assumption that no such amounts will be outstanding on or after December 31, 2008, and iii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our fixed and floating rate notes. Our floating rate notes mature in November 2008 and we plan to refinance these notes in 2008 with new financing sources. (b) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice, and with or without a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if we do not provide written notification of our intent to terminate the contract. Obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. (c) Represents the liability position of our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2007, which will fluctuate based on market conditions. (d) The timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control. (e) Represents accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of December 31, 2007. (f) We have estimated our pension plan funding requirements using assumptions that are consistent with pension legislation enacted during 2006. The actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated. Other Commercial Commitments We had $62.0 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2007, with expiration dates through 2015, certain of which contain a one year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are held primarily in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to their expiration in most circumstances. 65 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our critical accounting policies, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Stock Based Compensation We have stock based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock awards and units, unrestricted stock awards, and other equity based awards granted to employees and other key individuals who perform services for the Company. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 14, Stock Compensation Plans, to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs. We currently utilize the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors. Option pricing models require us to estimate a number of key valuation inputs including expected volatility, expected dividend yield, expected term and risk free interest rate. The most subjective estimates are the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected term when determining the fair market value of an option granted. Based on the limited amount of trading history of our common stock as a stand alone public company, we utilized a peer group to estimate the volatility assumption when calculating the fair value of stock options granted in late 2006 and 2007. In addition, our expected option terms are based in part on stock option exercise activity when we were part of First Data. Our volatility and expected option term assumptions could be significantly different going forward than what we have estimated for historical grants which could impact our stock based compensation expense in future periods. A 10% change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, would have affected pre tax income by approximately $5 million. Income Taxes Income taxes Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the analyses and judgments required under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and FIN 48. With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined United States federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely. At December 31, 2007, no provision had been made for United States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of approximately $1.2 billion, which are expected to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. If we were to repatriate those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise to the United States, the Company would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the period such repatriation occurred. 66 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Income tax contingencies Under the provisions of FIN 48, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, a substantial portion of which relate to potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003, whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is conducting audits of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for the years 2002 through 2004, which include our taxable results for those years. We currently contemplate that the IRS will complete the examination phase of its audit for these years during 2008. Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2007 were $276.2 million including interest and penalties. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, particularly with respect to our 2003 restructuring of our international operations, we may be exposed to material increases or decreases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Tax Allocation agreement withFirst Data Pursuant to a tax allocation agreement signed in connection with our spin off from First Data, we and First Data each are liable for taxes imposed on our respective businesses both prior to and after the spin off. We are in the process of resolving certain tax matters with First Data relating to periods prior to the spin off. Under the tax allocation agreement, with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the spin off (as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion), we may be liable to First Data for all or a portion of any such taxes or liabilities. Although we believe that we have appropriately apportioned such taxes between First Data and us through 2007, subsequent adjustments may occur. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the spin off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Derivative Financial Instruments We utilize derivative instruments to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk. We recognize all derivative instruments in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Cash Flow hedges Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted sales and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported earnings. As of December 31, 2007, the cumulative amount of unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting, net of income taxes, was $43.7 million. 67 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in the income statement. Fair Value hedges Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. Capitalized Costs We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts. These capitalized costs are classified in our consolidated balance sheets as other intangible assets. We evaluate such other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required. The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. Disruptions to an agent relationship, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with an agent contract, or other issues significantly impacting an agents business could require us to evaluate the recoverability of our capitalized initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts prior to the annual assessment. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could significantly impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur. We did not record any impairment charges related to other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005. The net carrying value of our capitalized contract costs at December 31, 2007 was $193.1 million. 68 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Goodwill Impairment Testing We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill, by comparing the reporting units fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We also have subsidiaries within our consolidated group with stand alone reporting requirements. Goodwill testing with respect to these subsidiaries is tested for impairment at the subsidiary level using that subsidiarys reporting units, which differ from our consolidated reporting units. Accordingly, if a goodwill impairment loss were recognized at the subsidiary level, a resulting impairment loss would be recorded at the consolidated level only to the extent that the consolidated reporting unit, where the subsidiary resides, experienced an impairment loss. We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected, regulatory, marketplace and other economic factors. There are also judgments around the determination of our reporting units. Reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2007 was $1,639.5 million which represented approximately 28% of our consolidated assets. During 2005, we recognized an impairment charge of $8.7 million relating to our 51% ownership interest in EPOSS Limited (EPOSS) due to a change in strategic direction. This impairment was recognized at both the subsidiary reporting unit and consolidated reporting unit level as EPOSS was its own reporting unit for stand alone and consolidated financial reporting. We have not recorded any other goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2007. 69 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. We believe the impact of adoption will not be significant to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we have, in most cases, historically reported assets and liabilities required to be reported at fair value using the methods prescribed by SFAS No. 157. On September 29, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. The remaining provisions that we will adopt under SFAS No. 158 require a plans funded status to be measured at the employers fiscal year end. We will change our measurement date from September 30 to December 31 during 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities (SFAS No. 159), which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008. We believe the impact of adoption will not be significant as we will not elect to measure any financial instruments or other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). This statement establishes a framework to disclose and account for business combinations. The adoption of the requirements of SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and may not be early adopted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). The statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary. The adoption of the requirements of SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2008 and may not be early adopted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 160. However, we do not expect the impact to be significant on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as our current non controlling interests are immaterial. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We provide money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in the agents local currency. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours 70 Table of Contents after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to three weeks, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. In certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. Our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues denominated primarily in the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. In February 2007, we revised certain guidelines related to our longer term foreign currency forward contracts, which we designate as hedges, to allow us to use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the risk related to forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted average maturity of approximately one year at any point in time. Prior to revising our guidelines with respect to such longer term foreign currency forward contracts, maturities at inception were generally one year or less. We expect that the extension of the maturity of certain of our hedges will provide additional predictability of future cash flows from our international operations and allow us to better manage and mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Prior to September 29, 2006, we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges under the provisions of SFAS No. 133. As a result, changes in the fair market value of our outstanding derivative instruments, which are impacted primarily by fluctuations in the euro, have been recognized in derivative gains/(losses), net in the consolidated statement of income for all derivatives entered into prior to September 29, 2006. Since these instruments were not designated to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, there was resulting volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to September 29, 2006. For example, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had pre tax derivative (losses)/gains of $(21.2) million and $45.8 million, respectively. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated would result in a decrease/increase to pretax annual income of approximately $28 million based on the Companys forecast of unhedged 2008 exposure to foreign currency at December 31, 2007. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, the unhedged exposure is static, and that the Company would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. Interest Rates We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a total value at December 31, 2007 of $1.7 billion. Most of this amount is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and is included in our consolidated balance sheets within cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets. Such assets classified as cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are readily convertible to cash. To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as settlement assets. Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Substantially all of the remainder of our portfolio consists of highly rated, fixed rate municipal bonds, which may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment 71 Table of Contents services awaiting redemption classified within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair market value of these fixed rate interest bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair market values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available for sale within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair market value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our total stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007, $838.2 million of our total $3,338.0 million in debt carries a floating interest rate or matures in such a short period that the financing is effectively a floating rate position. Of this floating rate debt, $500.0 million bears interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 15 basis points and is reset quarterly, and $338.2 million represents commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5% and a weighted average initial term of 36 days. The Company reviews its overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset position in each, also considering duration of the individual positions. The Company actively manages this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs, and optimize returns. Portfolio exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We revised certain guidelines in February 2007 and have begun, through the use of interest rate swaps designated as hedges, to increase the percent of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. For example, during June 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $75.0 million to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio. Our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings, including our hedges, outstanding at December 31, 2007 was approximately 5.63%. A hypothetical uniform 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease to pretax income of approximately $9.1 million annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2007 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on December 31, 2007 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting benefit to pre tax income of approximately $16.7 million annually. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. Credit Risk The Companys interest earning assets include money market fund investments, which are classified in cash and cash equivalents, and investment securities, substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt instruments, which are classified in settlement assets and accounted for as available for sale securities. Credit risk is significantly mitigated in the money market funds by both the short duration of the funds, as well as the diversification provided by the fund format. Substantially all of our investment securities are rated AA or better from a major credit rating agency. The Company is actively monitoring these positions in light of recent credit market events in the United States and abroad. Given the nature of the Companys portfolio, we do not expect significant impacts to our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not incur any impairment charges on our interest earning assets. 72 Table of Contents
