ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors and Forward looking Statements. Overview We are a leading provider of money transfer services, operating in two business segments: Consumer to consumer money transfer services, provided primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross border transfers that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and, in certain countries, intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Global business payments (formerly consumer to business), which allows for the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business payments service allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada based Custom House, Ltd. (Custom House), a provider of international business to business payment services, which is included in this segment. Custom House facilitates cross border, cross currency payment transactions. While we continue to pursue further international expansion of our offerings in this segment, the segments revenue was primarily generated in the United States during all periods presented. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other and primarily includes our money order services, and represented 2% or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (IPS), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation (First Data), to consumers at retail locations primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders. Also included in Other are expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer services, new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Significant Financial and Other Highlights Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2009 included: We generated $5,083.6 million in total consolidated revenues, representing a year over year decline of 4%. This decline was partially offset by the acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $30.8 million to revenue for 2009. We generated $1,282.7 million in consolidated operating income compared to $1,355.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year, representing a decrease of 5%. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from an anticipated agreement and settlement which resolves all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of 38 Table of Contents Arizona and requires us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona (the settlement accrual). The settlement agreement was signed on February 11, 2010. Results for 2008 included $82.9 million in restructuring and related expenses. Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in a year over year decline of 1%. The current year results included the settlement accrual, while the prior year results included the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above. Consolidated net income during 2009 was $848.8 million, representing a decline of 8% from 2008. The current results included the settlement accrual of $53.9 million, net of tax, while the prior year results included $51.6 million in restructuring and related expenses, net of tax. Our consumers transferred $71 billion in consumer to consumer principal, of which $65 billion related to cross border principal, which represented a decrease of 3% in both consumer to consumer principal and cross border principal over the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,218.1 million, a decrease of 3% over 2008. We completed two acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2009. In February 2009, we completed the acquisition of the money transfer business of one of our largest agents, European based FEXCO, for $243.6 million, including $157.4 million of cash consideration. As described earlier, we acquired Custom House in September 2009 for cash consideration of $371.0 million. Factors that we believe are important to our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our existing consumer to consumer business, innovating to provide new products and services, including electronic channels, to our intended consumer, expanding our global business payments segment to other markets across the world through our cross border, cross currency payment service offerings and improving our profitability by leveraging our scale, reducing costs and effectively utilizing capital. Significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include: Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue. The impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program. 39 Table of Contents Spin off from First Data We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed 100% of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as related assets, including real estate, through a tax free distribution to First Data shareholders (Spin off) through this previously owned subsidiary. Basis of Presentation The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. Adoption of Accounting Standards Business Combinations We adopted a new accounting standard related to accounting for business combinations and noncontrolling interests effective January 1, 2010. Under the new guidance, acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in estimates for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period, which is one year or less, impact income tax expense in the period of change. For business combinations achieved in stages, the new guidance requires that we re measure any noncontrolling equity investments in the acquiree to fair value as of the acquisition date immediately before obtaining control. All re measurement gains and losses are recognized in earnings and the total fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and any noncontrolling interests are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. Fair Value Measurements We monitor our investments in debt securities to determine if these securities are in an other than temporary impairment position under new accounting guidance introduced in 2009. Factors that could indicate an impairment exists include, but are not limited to: earnings performance, changes in credit rating or adverse changes in the regulatory or economic environment of the asset. If potential impairments exist, we assess whether or not we intend to sell the debt security, and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell it, before its anticipated recovery. We had no material other than temporary impairments during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Transaction fees Transaction fees are charged for sending money transfers and for global business payments services. Consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent. Transaction fees represented 79% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. Foreign exchange revenue In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. Foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been primarily driven by growth in international cross currency transactions. As a result of the acquisition of Custom House, our foreign exchange revenues have increased and we expect this trend to continue in 2010. Foreign exchange revenue represented 18% of Western Unions total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. 40 Table of Contents Commission and other revenues Commission and other revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator program (a recurring mortgage payment service program) and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer, money order and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets. As described above, prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were issued by IPS, from whom we received a commission. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders and no longer receive a commission from IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income derived from interest generated on money order settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets similar to our money transfer and payment services settlement assets. Commission and other revenues represented 3% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Cost of services Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represent approximately 75% of total cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses within these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative, or SGA, primarily consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses. Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with a loan made to several existing agents. Interest expense Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings, including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps. Derivative (losses)/gains, net Represents the portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, which includes (a) differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates and (b) gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge. Although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement (i.e., spot rate changes), the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer to consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our international business to business payments operations. The impact of these contracts is classified within foreign exchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income. Other income, net Other income, net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and other income and expenses. Results of Operations The following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our companys segments have been eliminated. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires us to fund a 41 Table of Contents multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Selling, general and administrative expenses. We incurred expenses of $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 for restructuring and related activities, which were not allocated to our segments. While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to Operating expenses overview. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred a $22.3 million accelerated stock based compensation vesting charge related to the acquisition of First Data by an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co. (KKR) which was allocated to our segments. For additional information refer to Operating expenses overview. The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 4,036.2 $ 4,240.8 $ 3,989.8 (5 )% 6 % Foreign exchange revenue 910.3 896.3 771.3 2 % 16 % Commission and other revenues 137.1 144.9 139.1 (5 )% 4 % Total revenues 5,083.6 5,282.0 4,900.2 (4 )% 8 % Expenses: Cost of services 2,874.9 3,093.0 2,808.4 (7 )% 10 % Selling, general and administrative 926.0 834.0 769.8 11 % 8 % Total expenses 3,800.9 3,927.0 3,578.2 (3 )% 10 % Operating income 1,282.7 1,355.0 1,322.0 (5 )% 2 % Other income/(expense): Interest income 9.4 45.2 79.4 (79 )% (43 )% Interest expense (157.9 ) (171.2 ) (189.0 ) (8 )% (9 )% Derivative (losses)/gains, net (2.8 ) (6.9 ) 8.3 * * Other income, net 0.1 16.6 1.7 * * Total other expense, net (151.2 ) (116.3 ) (99.6 ) 30 % 17 % Income before income taxes 1,131.5 1,238.7 1,222.4 (9 )% 1 % Provision for income taxes 282.7 319.7 365.1 (12 )% (12 )% Net income $ 848.8 $ 919.0 $ 857.3 (8 )% 7 % Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.21 $ 1.26 $ 1.13 (4 )% 12 % Diluted $ 1.21 $ 1.24 $ 1.11 (2 )% 12 % Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 698.9 730.1 760.2 Diluted 701.0 738.2 772.9 * Calculation not meaningful 42 Table of Contents Revenues overview 2009 compared to 2008 The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue were contributed by our consumer to consumer segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion. Consolidated revenue declined 4% during the year ended December 31, 2009. The revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions, and price decreases. Also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue by approximately 3%, as discussed below. The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia (EMEASA) region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 45% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The revenue declines were driven by most of the same factors discussed above. The acquisition of FEXCOs money transfer business did not have an impact on our revenue as we were already recognizing 100% of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at FEXCOs locations. The Americas region (including North America, Latin America, the Caribbean and South America) of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue and transaction declines due to the overall weak United States economy. Our Americas results were further impacted by pricing reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2009 which improved our transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in revenue. The global business payments segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion, also experienced revenue declines during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding prior period. Revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments businesses. Offsetting these declines in 2009 were the results of our Custom House acquisition, which contributed $30.8 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 primarily due to foreign exchange revenue from Custom House. Excluding the impact of Custom House, foreign exchange revenue decreased at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $119.5 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The impact to earnings per share during the period was less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program. The majority of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is related to the EMEASA region. 2008 compared to 2007 Consolidated revenue growth of 8% during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily driven by revenue growth internationally, particularly in the EMEASA region, due to increased money transfers at existing agent locations, and to a lesser extent, money transfers at new agent locations and due to the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the United States dollar, specifically the euro, discussed below. Our international consumer to consumer transactions that were originated outside of the United States also continued to experience strong revenue and transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. 43 Table of Contents However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on Western Union customers. In the fourth quarter, transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of 2008. In addition, the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. These factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of $96 million, over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign currency exchange rates increasing against the United States dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share. The benefit in the first three quarters of 2008 was slightly offset by the negative impact to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the United States dollar relative to certain other currencies, including the euro. However, the impact to our operating income was positive to the fourth quarter of 2008 due to our derivative hedges. Our Asia Pacific (APAC) region also experienced strong transaction and revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding previous period, including growth contributed by the inbound market to the Philippines. Revenue growth slowed in APAC during the fourth quarter 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, in part due to the weakening global economy described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in China. Within our Americas region, our United States to Mexico, United States outbound and transactions in our domestic (between and within the United States and Canada) businesses continued to be impacted by the overall weakening in the United States economy. The immigration debate and market softness, in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry, began adversely impacting the United States businesses in the second quarter of 2006. We responded to these factors by launching distribution, pricing, advertising, promotion and community outreach initiatives in 2006 and 2007. Although the United States businesses revenue decline experienced in 2008 moderated compared with 2007, we experienced increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2008, due to the weakening in the United States economy. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the corresponding previous period, due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth in international consumer to consumer transactions. As described above, foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 from the strengthening of other currencies most notably the euro, against the United States dollar. Operating expenses overview The following factors impacted both cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses during the periods presented: Restructuring and Related Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and related expenses of $62.8 million and $20.1 million are classified within cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. These restructuring and related expenses are associated with the closure of our facilities in Missouri and Texas and other reorganization plans executed in 2008. No expenses were recognized for these restructurings in 2009. 2007 Stock Compensation Charge At the time of the Spin off, First Data converted stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units (collectively, stock based awards) of First Data stock held by Western Union and First Data employees. Both Western Union and First Data 44 Table of Contents employees received converted Western Union stock based awards. All converted stock based awards, which had not vested prior to September 24, 2007, were subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the original First Data stock based awards, including change of control provisions which require full vesting upon a change of control of First Data. Accordingly, upon the completion of the acquisition of First Data on September 24, 2007 by an affiliate of KKR, all of these remaining converted unvested Western Union stock based awards vested. In connection with this accelerated vesting, we incurred a non cash pre tax charge of $22.3 million during the third quarter of 2007. Approximately one third of this charge was recorded within cost of services and two thirds was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Cost of services Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 primarily due to agent commissions, which decreased due to revenue declines, as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of FEXCO and other selective consumer to consumer commission initiatives. Also impacting cost of services was the strengthening of the United States dollar for most of 2009 compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on the translation of our expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost savings. These costs were offset by incremental operating costs, including increased technology costs and costs associated with Custom House. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 57% and 59% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 was generally due to reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of FEXCO and selective consumer to consumer agent commission initiatives, restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost savings, offset somewhat by incremental operating costs, including increased technology costs and costs associated with Custom House. In addition to the restructuring costs described above, cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007 primarily due to agent commissions which increase as revenues increase. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 59% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007 was primarily due to restructuring and related expenses of $62.8 million as described above, and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international consumer to consumer business, which carries higher cost of services compared to our United States originated businesses. Selected consumer to consumer international agent commissions have been lowered but were partially offset by certain higher commissions in the United States. In addition, a higher percentage of our global business payments services were generated from our United States electronic based payments and payments related to Pago Fcil, each of which had higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue compared to our United States cash based payments business. The increase was partially offset by lower stock compensation charges for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007, as described above and below, that did not recur in 2008. Selling, general and administrative SGA increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual described below, incremental costs associated with the acquisitions of FEXCO and Custom House including costs related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other increased operating expenses, offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires us to fund a 45 Table of Contents multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona. The accrual includes amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, we expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and to engage a monitor of that program, which are expected to cost up to $23 million over the next two to four years. SGA expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher employee compensation expenses and restructuring and related expenses of $20.1 million, offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses as well as lower stock compensation charges in 2008, as described above. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, marketing related expenditures, principally classified within SGA, were approximately 5% to 6% of revenue. Marketing related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments, as discussed in Segment Discussion, for consumer to consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments. Interest income Interest income decreased during both the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower average interest bearing cash balances. Interest expense Interest expense decreased for both the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower short term interest rates on certain debt with floating interest rates. In addition, lower average borrowing balances impacted the decline in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the previous year. Derivative (losses)/gains, net Changes in derivative (losses)/gains, net were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the prior year. Volatility in foreign currency forward rates compared to spot rates, primarily related to the euro, resulted in the decrease to income for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Other income, net Other income, net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to a $12 million reserve taken against our receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. and a decline in earnings on our equity method investments in 2009, primarily as a result of the absence of equity method earnings for FEXCO subsequent to the acquisition date. Changes in other income, net during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the previous corresponding year was primarily attributable to fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments. Income taxes Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 25.0%, 25.8% and 29.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. In addition, during 2008, we implemented additional foreign tax efficient strategies consistent with our overall tax planning which impacted our effective tax rate for all subsequent periods. 46 Table of Contents Recent proposed changes to United States tax laws, if enacted, could potentially adversely affect our future effective tax rate. We are closely monitoring the proposed changes, and the potential effect on our future effective tax rate will depend on the final form of any new law. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in 2003, whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of $522.7 million, including accrued interest and penalties. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue, and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows. The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004, of which we are a part, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleges significant additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries, and we generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these potential Western Union related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the Spin off. We agree with a number of the adjustments in the Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not agree with the Notice of Deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of approximately $114 million. As of December 31, 2009, interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments would be approximately $30 million. A substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates to our international restructuring, which took effect in the fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are attributable to 2004. On March 20, 2009, we filed a petition in the United States Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which we do not agree. We believe our overall reserves are adequate, including those associated with adjustments alleged in the Notice of Deficiency. If the IRS position in the Notice of Deficiency is sustained, our tax provision related to 2003 and later years would materially increase, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Earnings per share During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, basic earnings per share were $1.21, $1.26 and $1.13, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.21, $1.24 and $1.11, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were 37.5 million, 8.0 million and 10.4 million, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti dilutive. The increase in anti dilutive shares in 2009 was primarily due to the majority of our outstanding options having an exercise price higher than our average market price for the year ended December 31, 2009. Of the 42.8 million, 43.6 million and 59.4 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, approximately 40%, 47% and 58%, respectively, were held by employees of First Data. Earnings per share decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding previous period as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income, offset by lower weighted 47 Table of Contents average shares outstanding. Earnings per share increased during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 due to the increased net income as a result of the previously described factors and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The lower number of shares outstanding was driven by stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in both 2009 and 2008 compared to the corresponding periods. Segment Discussion We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are consumer to consumer and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as Other. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our CODM are computed in accordance with the following principles: The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments revenue compared to total revenue. Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions are included in Other. An accrual of $71.0 million for an anticipated agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009 has not been allocated to the segments. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Operating expenses overview. Restructuring and related activities of $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 have not been allocated to the segments. While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to Operating expenses overview. All items not included in operating income are excluded. The following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Consumer to consumer (a) EMEASA 45 % 44 % 40 % Americas 32 % 34 % 37 % APAC 8 % 7 % 6 % Total consumer to consumer 85 % 85 % 83 % Global business payments 14 % 14 % 15 % Other 1 % 1 % 2 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (a) The geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we 48 Table of Contents split the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed to that region. Consumer to Consumer Segment The following table sets forth our consumer to consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2009 2008 2007 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 3,373.5 $ 3,532.9 $ 3,286.6 (5 )% 7 % Foreign exchange revenue 877.1 893.1 769.3 (2 )% 16 % Other revenues 50.1 45.6 37.2 10 % 23 % Total revenues $ 4,300.7 $ 4,471.6 $ 4,093.1 (4 )% 9 % Operating income $ 1,175.5 $ 1,222.7 $ 1,078.3 (4 )% 13 % Operating income margin 27 % 27 % 26 % Key indicator: Consumer to consumer transactions 196.1 188.1 167.7 4 % 12 % The table below sets forth transaction and revenue growth/(decline) rates by region for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Consumer to consumer transaction growth/(decline) (a): EMEASA 10 % 23 % Americas (3 )% 2 % APAC 18 % 27 % Consumer to consumer revenue growth/(decline) (a): EMEASA (1 )% 16 % Americas (9 )% (1 )% APAC 5 % 22 % (a) In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to that region. When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for individual countries in the following discussion, all transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of the revenue associated with each transaction to, from and within those countries are included. The countries of India and China combined represented approximately 7%, 6% and 5% of consolidated Western Union revenues during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, represented more than approximately 6%, 7% and 7% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 49 Table of Contents Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue declined 4% on transaction growth of 4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008. The revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions, and price decreases. Also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue by approximately 2%, as discussed below. Our international consumer to consumer business experienced a revenue decline of 1% on transaction growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the United States and Canada and transactions to and from Mexico. Our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States also experienced revenue declines on transaction increases for the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of the same factors described above. Revenue in our EMEASA region declined 1% during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to most of the same factors discussed above. Our largest European markets experienced revenue declines during most of the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Our money transfer business to India for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus the same period in 2008 continued to grow with transaction growth of 22% and revenue growth of 11%. Revenue and transaction growth for both India and the Gulf States slowed throughout the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Due to the economic conditions in the Gulf States, transaction growth rates declined to single digits in the fourth quarter and we expect slowing transaction growth to impact 2010. Americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Contributing to the overall decline in the Americas region was the domestic business (transactions between and within the United States and Canada) which experienced a revenue decline of 14% on a transaction decline of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The repositioning of the domestic business, including pricing reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved our Americas and domestic transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in revenue. Our Mexico business also contributed to the overall decline in the Americas region with a revenue decline of 15% on a transaction decline of 12% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our United States domestic and Mexico business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the United States. Our Mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of certain Vigo branded agents, substantially all of which were small retailers, due to credit concerns. However, the decline in revenue for our United States outbound business moderated in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the previous nine months of 2009 as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our APAC revenue increased 5% on transaction growth of 18% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The APAC regions revenues have been impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the United States dollar, as further described below, as well as moderating transaction growth. China revenue grew 1% on 4% transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2009. Foreign exchange revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the corresponding previous period at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $101.3 million over the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The majority of our exposure is related to the EMEASA region. We have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and competitive 50 Table of Contents factors. Fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. For the year ended December 31, 2009, such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately 2% of total Western Union revenue compared to 1% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations. Send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location, migration patterns, the locations class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the 410,000 agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2009, more than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and Western Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer brands: Western Union, Orlandi Valuta and Vigosm) experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations, approximately 70% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions. 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth was 9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the same period in 2007. This increase was driven by revenue growth of 13% in our international business on transaction growth of 17%. Our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States also continued to experience strong revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2008 as a result of strong transaction growth. However, during the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue was impacted by the weakening global economy and its effect on Western Union customers. In the fourth quarter, transaction growth rates slowed sequentially compared to the first nine months of 2008. In addition, the amount of money remitted per transaction declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. These factors resulted in less transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Revenue growth in our EMEASA region was 16% on transaction growth of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the same period in 2007. The growth in our EMEASA region during the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily driven by transaction growth and the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the United States dollar, specifically the euro, as further described below. Contributing to the growth in the EMEASA region was strong transaction growth of over 60% in our money transfer business to India for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007, resulting in revenue growth of over 45%. Over the same period, revenue growth in the Gulf States continued to be strong. However, revenue growth in some European markets during the year ended December 31, 2008 slowed over the previous year, especially during the fourth quarter of 2008 as certain countries within Europe, such as Spain, experienced declines in the housing industry and rising unemployment. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in a benefit to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of $96 million, over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The positive impact to operating profit derived from foreign 51 Table of Contents currency exchange rates increasing against the United States dollar during the year was offset by the impact of foreign currency derivative losses for those foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedges and the portion of fair value that is excluded from the measure of effectiveness for these contracts designated as hedges thereby resulting in a minimal impact to overall earnings per share. Americas revenue declined 1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007 but transactions grew 2% for the same period. The United States domestic and the United States outbound revenue continued to decline, due to the overall weakening in the United States economy and rising unemployment, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Within the Americas region, revenue declines in our domestic business, which represents approximately 10% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008, continued to occur due to the factors described above. Although the domestic and United States outbound revenue declines experienced in 2008 moderated compared to those experienced in 2007, we did experience increased revenue declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2008, due to the further weakening in the United States economy. Domestic revenue declined 6% on transaction declines of 3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007. In addition, United States telephone money transfer revenues continued to decline, and website money transfer revenues were flat for the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenue in our Mexico business was down 2% on transaction declines of 1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The Mexico business continued to be impacted by the weakening in the United States economy, noted earlier, with such declines increasing in the fourth quarter of 2008. During a few weeks in the fourth quarter 2008, the value of the Mexican peso decreased dramatically against the United States dollar and, as a result, we experienced a spike in transactions as United States senders took advantage of the more favorable exchange rates. As the devaluation of the peso was sudden and unusual, we needed to acquire pesos at less favorable rates in order to meet the demand for immediate payout in Mexico, which impacted the overall decline in revenue by less than $5 million. Revenue and transaction growth in the APAC region for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was driven by strong inbound growth to the region, especially to the Philippines. China revenue and transactions grew at 13% and 11% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the corresponding period in 2007, respectively. Revenue growth rates slowed to China during the third quarter of 2008, with revenue declining in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, in part due to the weakening economic situation described previously and the decline in high revenue transactions from small entrepreneurs that typically make purchases in China. Foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of growth in international consumer to consumer transactions. As described above, foreign exchange revenue also benefited during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 from the exchange rate between other currencies against the United States dollar, despite the negative impact of currency rate fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer to consumer operating income decreased 4% during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the decline in revenue, incremental costs, including increased technology costs and the acquisition of FEXCO, offset somewhat by reduced agent commissions, savings realized from the 2008 restructurings and better leveraging of our marketing expenses, as described earlier. The operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 was consistent with 2008. 2008 compared to 2007 Consumer to consumer operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily driven by higher revenue and related profits from increased transactions internationally and 52 Table of Contents lower stock based compensation expenses. Of the $22.3 million accelerated stock based compensation vesting charge in 2007 taken in connection with the change in control of First Data, that did not recur in 2008, $18.9 million was allocated to this segment in 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, the operating income increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our United States businesses, and higher employee compensation expenses. The ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business, which carries lower profit margins than in our United States originated business, also impacted consumer to consumer operating income during the year ended December 31, 2008. As described earlier in the revenues overview and due to the same factors, operating income growth for the consumer to consumer segment was lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 than that experienced in the previous nine months. Consumer to consumer operating income margin also increased during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense, as described above. This increase was partially offset by revenue declines in our United States businesses and the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business, which carries lower profit margins than in our United States originated business as noted earlier. However, we have been experiencing a convergence between international operating profits margins and profit margins of our United States originated businesses. Global Business Payments Segment The following table sets forth our global business payments segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2009 2008 2007 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 621.9 $ 668.1 $ 665.5 (7 )% 0 % Foreign exchange revenue 33.2 3.2 2.0 * * Other revenues 36.6 48.5 52.4 (25 )% (7 )% Total revenues $ 691.7 $ 719.8 $ 719.9 (4 )% 0 % Operating income $ 171.9 $ 199.4 $ 223.7 (14 )% (11 )% Operating income margin 25 % 28 % 31 % Key indicator: Global business payments transactions 414.8 412.1 404.5 1 % 2 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenues 2009 compared to 2008 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the global business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments businesses, partially offset by revenue generated from our recent acquisition of Custom House, as described below, and slight growth in the Pago Fcil business. We believe many United States consumers who would use our services are having difficulty paying their bills and are unable to obtain credit, resulting in our handling fewer bill payments. Due to a continued challenging United States economy and competitive pressure, we expect to see revenue declines in our United States consumer to business service offerings in 2010 similar to the declines we experienced in 2009. Although the segments revenues were primarily generated in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2009, we expect the proportion of international revenue, specifically foreign exchange revenue, will grow in future periods as a percentage of total revenue due to our acquisition of Custom House. 53 Table of Contents On September 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Canada based Custom House, a provider of international business to business payment services. Custom House facilitates cross border, cross currency payment transactions. The significant majority of Custom Houses revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments. The credit risk arising from these spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely mitigated, as in the majority of cases Custom House requires the receipt of funds from customers before releasing the associated cross currency payment. In addition, this business writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for their customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. The significant majority of Custom Houses revenue is generated from transactions involving different currencies, in which Custom House generates revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by Custom House to the customer and the rate at which Custom House is able to acquire currency or forward and option contracts. This foreign exchange revenue is recorded at the time the customer initiates a transaction with Custom House. The acquisition of Custom House contributed $30.8 million to total revenue, primarily included in foreign exchange revenue, and approximately 200,000 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2009. Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by our Pago Fcil cash based and United States electronic based bill payments businesses. Both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction than our United States cash based bill payment business. The transaction growth was offset by a decline in the United States cash based bill payments business. 2008 compared to 2007 During the year ended December 31, 2008, overall revenue was flat compared to the corresponding period in 2007, as revenue growth in the Pago Fcil business was offset by a decline in United States cash based bill payment revenue. The global business payments segment, including the United States electronic based bill payments business which experienced flat revenues year over year, was adversely impacted in the last half of 2008 due to the weakening economy in the United States. Some consumers who were likely to use our services were having difficulty paying their bills and were unable to obtain credit in any form, resulting in us handling fewer bill payments. Operating income 2009 compared to 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to operating income declines related to the United States based bill payments business and operating and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Custom House, offset slightly by the savings generated from the 2008 restructurings. The decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the decline in the United States cash based bill payments business which has a higher operating income margin than our South America and electronic businesses. 2008 compared to 2007 Operating income for the global business payments segment decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to operating income declines in the United States based bill payments businesses, partially offset by growth in Pago Fcil payments. Operating income margins also declined as United States electronic based and Pago Fcil payments, which cumulatively represented a higher percentage of global business payments revenues in 2008 compared to 2007, have lower operating margins than the declining higher margin United States cash based bill payments business. Partially offsetting operating income declines for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 was lower stock based compensation expenses as described in the consumer to consumer operating income discussion. 54 Table of Contents Other The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2009 2008 (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues $ 91.2 $ 90.6 $ 87.2 1 % 4 % Operating income $ 6.3 $ 15.8 $ 20.0 (60 )% (21 )% Operating income margin 7 % 17 % 23 % Revenues 2009 compared to 2008 Revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is comprised primarily of our money order services business. In the fourth quarter, we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue recognized related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on the outstanding money order balances as described below. However, we now derive investment income from actual interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal securities. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Through a combination of the revenue generated from these investment securities and the anticipated interest expense savings resulting from these interest rate swaps, we estimate that we should be able to retain, a materially comparable after tax rate of return through 2011 as we were receiving under the agreement with IPS. However, the results of interest expense savings related to the swaps will be reflected in interest expense and will not impact operating income. Effective October 1, 2009, in accordance with the agreement signed on July 18, 2008, IPS, a subsidiary of First Data, assigned and transferred to us certain operating assets used by IPS to issue Western Union branded money orders and approximately $860 million of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities. On the Transition Date, we assumed IPSs role as issuer of the money orders, including its obligation to pay outstanding money orders, and terminated the existing agreement whereby IPS paid Western Union a fixed return of 5.5% on the outstanding money order balances. Following the Transition Date, we invested the cash received from IPS in high quality, investment grade securities, primarily tax exempt United States state and municipal securities, in accordance with applicable regulations, which are the same as those currently governing the investment of our United States originated money transfer principal. 2008 compared to 2007 Revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the same period in 2007 due to revenue growth in our prepaid services business generated outside of the United States. Operating income 2009 compared to 2008 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 as described above. 2008 compared to 2007 For the year ended December 31, 2008, the decrease in operating income was driven by operating income declines related to our money order services business, costs incurred to develop mobile money transfer services and our prepaid business within the United States, offset by increased revenue and related profits from our prepaid services business outside of the United States. 55 Table of Contents Further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, driven primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, timing of income tax payments, and collections on receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters, and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant population, and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters. In 2010, we are considering making a $250 million refundable tax deposit relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities arising from our 2003 international restructuring. By making the deposit, interest charges related to the amount of the deposit will cease. To the extent the deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax liabilities, it is refundable with interest. A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions. The assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions include those located in countries outside of the United States containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained by a regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the United States in accordance with applicable state regulations. Significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including dividends and share repurchases, through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations. In addition, we have capacity to borrow on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which was undrawn at December 31, 2009 and expires in September 2012. Cash and Investment Securities As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7 billion, of which $906 million was held by our foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash balances to fluctuate. Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services and money orders before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations. Investment securities, included in settlement assets, were $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2009. Effective October 1, 2009, IPS assigned and transferred to us certain operating assets used by IPS to issue Western Union branded money orders and approximately $860 million of cash sufficient to satisfy all outstanding money order liabilities which contributed to the increase in our investment securities from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Most state regulators in the United States require us to maintain specific high quality, investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement 56 Table of Contents obligations in accordance with applicable regulations. We do not hold investment securities for trading purposes, and all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value. Under the Payment Services Directive (PSD) in the European Union, we expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities, which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current portfolio. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments, including diversifying our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2009, there were no investments with a single issuer or individual securities representing more than 10% of our investment securities portfolio. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $1,218.1 million, $1,253.9 million and $1,103.5 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to lower net income, offset by working capital fluctuations in 2009 including the settlement accrual and the timing of tax payments. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased from 2007 to 2008 due to higher net income and working capital fluctuations in 2008. Financing Resources As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions): 2009 2008 Due in less than one year: Commercial paper $ $ 82.9 Term loan (a) 500.0 Due in greater than one year: 5.400% notes, net of discount, due 2011 (b) 1,033.9 1,042.8 6.500% notes, net of discount, due 2014 (c) 498.6 5.930% notes, net of discount, due 2016 (d) 1,012.5 1,014.4 6.200% notes, net of discount, due 2036 497.5 497.4 Other borrowings 6.0 6.0 Total borrowings $ 3,048.5 $ 3,143.5 (a) The term loan due in December 2009 (Term Loan) was paid and financed with the issuance of the 6.500% notes due 2014 (2014 Notes) on February 26, 2009. (b) At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held interest rate swaps related to the 5.400% notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) with an aggregate notional amount of $750 million and $550 million, respectively. The carrying value of the 2011 Notes at December 31, 2009 and 2008 contained $34.3 million and $42.7 million, respectively, of hedge accounting adjustments related to active swaps as well as the unamortized portion of previously terminated swaps. These hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to interest expense over the life of the 2011 Notes. (c) The 2014 Notes were issued on February 26, 2009 and the proceeds were used to repay the Term Loan. (d) The carrying value of the 2016 Notes at December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $12.8 million and $15.4 million, respectively, of hedge accounting adjustments. The remaining unamortized portion of this previously terminated swap will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the 2016 Notes. 57 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2009. Our commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2008 had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.1% and a weighted average initial term of 27 days. Revolving Credit Facility Our revolving credit facility expires in September 2012 and includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on the total facility is payable quarterly regardless of usage. In addition, to the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate commitments, a utilization fee of 5 basis points as of December 31, 2009 based upon such ratings is payable to the lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings. The interest rate margin, facility fee and utilization fee are all based on certain of our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings and had $1.5 billion available to borrow. Our revolving credit facility, which is diversified through a group of 15 participating institutions, is used to provide general liquidity for us and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately 20%. The substantial majority of the banks within this group were rated at least an A or better as of December 31, 2009. If the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased, or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted. Term Loan On December 5, 2008, we entered into a senior, unsecured, 364 day term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million with a syndicate of lenders. The Term Loan was repaid and financed with the issuance of the 2014 Notes on February 26, 2009. Notes On February 26, 2009, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes to repay the balance of the Term Loan which was scheduled to mature in December 2009. Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semiannually on February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. On November 17, 2006, we issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of our unsecured fixed and floating rate notes, comprised of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due 2008 (the Floating Rate Notes), $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.400% Notes due 2011 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.200% Notes due 2036 (the 2036 Notes). The Floating Rate Notes were paid upon maturity in November 2008. Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 17 and November 17 each year. We may redeem the 2011 Notes and 58 Table of Contents the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. On September 29, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and overall business risks. Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin, facility fee and utilization fee, all of which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions in our 2014 Notes and certain of our derivative contracts which would require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2009: December 31, 2009 SP Moodys Fitch Short term rating A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured A A3 A Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following: Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated; We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings; Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease; Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and Our agent relationships may be adversely impacted, particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices. The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants which, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2011 Notes, 2016 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain a restriction on subsidiary indebtedness and none of the notes include a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation expense, (d) amortization expense, (e) any other non cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net 59 Table of Contents income for such period and (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in accordance with United States GAAP for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 10:1 for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow, and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes. Cash Priorities Liquidity Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with our current credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available to support the needs of our business. Capital Expenditures The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $98.9 million, $153.7 million and $192.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contract costs vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during 2009, 2008 and 2007 included investments in our information technology, purchased and developed software and, in 2008 and 2007, the renovation of certain facilities. Acquisition of Businesses On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada based Custom House, a provider of international business to business payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million for 100% of the common shares of this business and acquired cash of $2.5 million. On February 24, 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of European based FEXCO Group Holdings (FEXCO Group) one of our largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group and paid 123.1 million ($157.4 million) as consideration for 100% of the common shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of $11.8 million. In December 2008, we acquired 80% of our existing money transfer agent in Peru for a purchase price of $35.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid was $29.7 million, net of a holdback reserve of $3.0 million and cash acquired of $2.3 million. On August 1, 2008, we acquired the money transfer assets from our existing money transfer agent in Panama for a purchase price of $18.3 million, which is net of cash acquired. The consideration paid was $14.3 million, net of a holdback reserve of $4.0 million. We expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies, particularly outside of the United States, that complement our existing businesses worldwide. Share Repurchases and Dividends At December 31, 2009, common stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion have been authorized by the Board of Directors through December 31, 2012. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 24.8 million, 58.1 million and 34.7 million shares, respectively, have been repurchased for $400.0 million, $1,313.9 million and $726.5 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $16.10, $22.60 and $20.93 per share, respectively. 60 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share representing $41.2 million in total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, our Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share representing $28.4 million and $30.0 million, respectively, in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in December of each respective year. Equity Investments In and Loans to Certain Key Agents In October 2007, we entered into agreements totaling $18.3 million to convert our non participating interest in a joint venture with our Singapore agent, Hersing Corporation Ltd., into a fully participating 49% equity interest and extended the agent relationship at more favorable commission rates to Western Union. As a result, we earn a pro rata share of profits and have enhanced voting rights. We also have the right to add additional agent relationships in Singapore under this agreement. In October 2007, we completed an agreement to acquire a 25% ownership interest in GraceKennedy Money Services Caribbean SRL (GraceKennedy), an agent in Jamaica (which also acts as our agent in several other Caribbean countries), and to extend the term of the agent relationship for $29.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid resulted in $20.2 million of identifiable intangible assets, including capitalized contract costs, which are being amortized over seven to 10 years. From time to time, we also make advances and loans to agents. Most significantly, in the first quarter 2006, we signed a six year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a four year loan of $140.0 million to the agent, of which $33.1 million, $40.0 million and $30.0 million were repaid in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The remaining loan receivable balance relating to this agent as of December 31, 2009 was $16.9 million and was fully repaid in January 2010. As opportunities arise, we expect we will continue to strategically invest in agents to further strengthen our business. Debt Service Requirements Our 2010 debt service requirements will include interest payments on all outstanding indebtedness and may include payments on any future borrowings under our commercial paper program. We have the ability to use existing financing sources, such as our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program, to meet obligations as they arise. Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Pension Plans We have two frozen defined benefit pension plans (Plans) for which we have a recorded unfunded pension obligation of $124.2 million as of December 31, 2009. Due to the closure of one of our facilities in Missouri and a recent agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, we funded $4.1 million into one of our subsidiarys pension plans during 2009. No contributions were made to these plans by Western Union during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Pursuant to final guidance issued by the IRS in September 2009, we made certain interest rate elections under the Pension Protection Act which will require 61 Table of Contents us to fund approximately $15 million to the plans in 2010, which is less than was previously anticipated. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $10 million for a total contribution of $25 million to the plans in 2010. Our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was December 31, 2009. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions: 1) expected long term return on plan assets; and 2) discount rate. Western Union employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification, re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. Our expected long term return on plan assets was 7.50% for 2009 and 2008. The expected long term return on plan assets is 6.50% for 2010. A 25 basis point change in the assumed return for 2010 would impact our annual pension expense by approximately $0.8 million. The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the plans to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 5.30% and 6.26% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have an impact of less than $0.1 million to our annual pension expense. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Borrowings, including interest (a) $ 4,490.5 $ 157.0 $ 1,318.9 $ 717.0 $ 2,297.6 Unrecognized tax benefits (b) 522.7 Purchase obligations (c) 154.9 42.7 52.2 30.0 30.0 Estimated pension funding (d) 120.6 14.9 47.3 38.8 19.6 Operating leases 107.7 28.3 37.3 22.6 19.5 Foreign currency derivative contracts (e) 80.6 70.4 10.2 Other (f) 81.6 75.1 4.0 2.5 $ 5,558.6 $ 388.4 $ 1,469.9 $ 810.9 $ 2,366.7 (a) We have estimated our interest payments based on (i) the assumption that no commercial paper borrowings will be outstanding beyond 2009 and (ii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes. (b) The timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control. In 2010, we are considering making a $250 million refundable tax deposit relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities arising from our 2003 international restructuring. By making the deposit, interest charges related to the amount of the deposit will cease. To the extent the deposit is not ultimately used to satisfy federal tax liabilities, it is refundable 62 Table of Contents with interest. Due to the uncertainty surrounding this tax deposit, the amount has not been reflected in the table above. (c) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a termination penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. (d) We have estimated our pension plan funding requirements, including interest, using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates. The actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $10 million to the plans in 2010, which has not been reflected in the table above. (e) Represents the liability position of our foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2009, which will fluctuate based on market conditions. (f) This line item primarily includes the expected payment of $71.0 million related to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona, including amounts to be paid to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona. The table above excludes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and the engagement of a monitor of that program of approximately $23 million to be incurred over the next two to four years also related to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona due to the uncertainty over the timing of payments. This balance also represents accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of December 31, 2009. Other Commercial Commitments We had $88.0 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2009, with expiration dates through 2015, certain of which contain a one year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. 63 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition. Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Income Taxes Reinvestment of foreign earnings Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments. With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined United States federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely. At December 31, 2009, no provision had been made for United States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of approximately $2.0 billion, which are expected to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely. Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 64 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Income tax contingencies We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003. Our tax reserves reflect managements judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of t he United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for the years 2002 through 2004, which include our taxable results for those years. Refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these audits.Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection with the Spin off from First Data, we believe we have appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us. Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2009 were $522.7 million, including interest and penalties. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, particularly with respect to our 2003 restructuring of our international operations, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 65 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Derivative Financial Instruments We utilize derivatives to (a) minimize our exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross currency business to business payments by writing derivatives to customers and entering into offsetting derivatives with established financial institution counterparties, or by holding sufficient foreign currency cash balances to cover those transactions. We recognize all derivatives in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.Cash Flow hedges Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted money transfer revenues and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss ar e reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in Derivative (losses)/gains, net.Fair Value hedges Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense. The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements.The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis.If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results.As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative pre tax unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $24.6 million.As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a $47.1 million gain. 66 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Other Intangible Assets We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as well as acquired intangible assets and software.We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value (normally measured by discounted cash flows) is required. The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.The estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions including among other things revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans. Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset.If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge. We did not record any impairment charges related to other intangible assets during the three year period ended December 31, 2009.The net carrying value of our other intangible assets at December 31, 2009 was $489.2 million. Goodwill Impairment Testing We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill, by comparing the reporting units fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds i ts implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.Reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace and other economic factors.The determination of the reporting units also requires judgment. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change.If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it could impact our reported earnings in the periods such charge occurs.The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2009 was $2,143.4 million which represented approximately 29% of our consolidated assets.We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2009.The fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts for the three years ended December 31, 2009. 67 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. For most acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as agent networks, customer relationships, tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of one year or less as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Purchase price allocation methodology requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. During the last three years, we completed the following significant acquisitions: In September 2009, we acquired Custom House for $371.0 million. In February 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of FEXCO for $243.6 million. In 2008, we acquired an 80% interest in our existing money transfer agent in Peru and the money transfer assets of an agent in Panama for a total of $53.3 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information related to the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed during the last three years. If estimates or assumptions used to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made, the allocation of purchase price between goodwill and intangibles could significantly differ. Such a difference would impact future earnings through amortization expense of these intangibles. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments could arise, as discussed further in Goodwill Impairment Testing and Other Intangible Assets above. For the acquisitions discussed above, goodwill of $504.1 million and intangibles of $208.7 million were recognized. New Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2010, we adopted new accounting requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities. Variable interest entities are those entities that require additional financial support beyond that provided by traditional equity holders. The new consolidation guidance will require consideration of whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact each entities economic performance. We have not yet completed our assessment of this guidance; however, the impact of adopting these new requirements is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 68 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We provide consumer to consumer money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany loans. In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consumer to consumer revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international consumer to consumer operations. With the acquisition of Custom House in the third quarter of 2009, our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management has increased due to the nature of this business. The significant majority of Custom Houses revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments. This business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Custom House aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre tax annual income of approximately $27 million and $24 million, respectively, based on our forecast of consumer to consumer unhedged 2010 exposure to foreign currency. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. Interest Rates We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a total value at December 31, 2009 of $2.7 billion. Approximately $2.0 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. These assets primarily include money market funds and state and 69 Table of Contents municipal variable rate securities and are included in our consolidated balance sheets within cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets. To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as settlement assets. Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Substantially all of the remainder of our interest bearing assets consist of highly rated state and municipal obligations, the majority of which are fixed rate instruments. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment services awaiting redemption classified within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed rate interest bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available for sale within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our total stockholders equity/(deficiency) on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2009, $750 million of our total $3,048.5 million in borrowings was effectively floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing our fixed rate debt to LIBOR based floating rate debt, with average spreads of approximately 200 basis points above LIBOR. Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. No commercial paper borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2009. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs, and optimize returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. At December 31, 2009, our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings outstanding, including our hedges, was approximately 5.1%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre tax income of approximately $8 million and $12 million annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on December 31, 2009 and 2008 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting benefit/reduction to pre tax income of approximately $20 million and $13 million annually, respectively. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. Credit Risk Our interest earning assets include investment securities, substantially all of which are state and municipal debt obligations, which are classified in settlement assets and accounted for as available for sale securities, and money market fund investments, which are classified in cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. On September 15, 2008, we requested redemption of our shares in the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. (the Fund), a money market fund, totaling $298.1 million. In 2009, we received partial distributions totaling $255.5 million from the Fund. We continue to vigorously pursue collection of the remaining balance and believe we have a right to full payment of the remaining amount based on the written and verbal representations from the Manager and our legal position. However, given the increased uncertainty surrounding the numerous third party legal claims associated with the Fund, we reserved $12 million 70 Table of Contents representing the estimated impact of a pro rata distribution of the Fund during 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had a remaining receivable balance of $30.6 million, net of the related reserve, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. If further deterioration occurs in the underlying assets in the Fund, or if the Fund incurs significant legal and or administrative costs during the distribution process, we may record additional reserves related to the remaining receivable balance, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market investments and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. Since January 1, 2009, we also limit our investment level to no more than $100 million with respect to individual funds. We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk in bill payment and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our internet services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to chargebacks, insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses. Our losses associated with agent and consumer bad debts have been less than 1% of our revenues in all periods presented. We continue to monitor the credit worthiness of our agents, and due to the challenging economy, we have closed agents at higher rates than in prior years, primarily small retailers in the United States. Closing agents may impact transactions and revenues. As a result of our acquisition of Custom House, we are now exposed to credit risk relating to derivative financial instruments written by us to our customers. The duration of these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. To mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis. In addition, we may require certain customers to post collateral based on the fair value of the customers contract and their risk profile. The credit risk arising from our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely mitigated, as in most cases we require the receipt of funds from our customers before releasing the associated cross currency payment. 71 Table of Contents
