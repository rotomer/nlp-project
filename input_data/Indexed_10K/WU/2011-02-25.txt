ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors and Forward looking Statements. Overview We are a leading provider of money movement services, operating in two business segments: Consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross border transfers that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and, in certain countries, intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Global business payments the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. In September 2009, we acquired Canada based Custom House, Ltd. (Custom House), a provider of international business to business payment services, which is included in this segment. Custom House, which has been rebranded Western Union Business Solutions (Business Solutions) in September 2010, facilitates cross border, cross currency payment transactions. The international expansion and other key strategic initiatives have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment. However, the majority of the segments revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other and primarily include our money order services, and represented 2% or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Prior to October 1, 2009, the Companys money orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (IPS), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation (First Data), to consumers at retail locations primarily in the United States and Canada. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders. Also included in Other are expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings, including costs to develop mobile money transfer services, new prepaid service offerings and costs incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Significant Financial and Other Highlights Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2010 included: We generated $5,192.7 million in total consolidated revenues compared to $5,083.6 million in the prior year, representing a year over year increase of 2%. The acquisition of Custom House contributed $111.0 million and $30.8 million to revenue for 2010 and 2009, respectively. We incurred $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses as described within Operating expenses overview. We expect to incur approximately $50 million in additional expenses in 2011 for a total of approximately $110 million related to the actions announced on May 27, 2010 and as subsequently revised. No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in 2009. 40 Table of Contents We generated $1,300.1 million in consolidated operating income compared to $1,282.7 million in the prior year, representing an increase of 1%. The current year results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above. The prior year results included an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from an agreement and settlement which includes the resolution of all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and a multi state agreement to fund a not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border (the settlement accrual). Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended December 31, 2010, which is flat year over year. The current year results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above, while the prior year results include the settlement accrual mentioned above. Consolidated net income was $909.9 million, representing an increase of 7% from 2009. The current year results include $39.3 million in restructuring and related expenses, net of tax. The prior year results include the settlement accrual of $53.9 million, net of tax. Our consumers transferred $76 billion in consumer to consumer principal, of which $69 billion related to cross border principal, which represented an increase of 6% in both consumer to consumer principal and cross border principal over the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were $994.4 million, a decrease of 18% over 2009. This decrease was primarily the result of a $250 million refundable tax deposit we made relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued for in our financial statements. We issued $250 million of aggregate principal amount of our 6.200% notes due 2040 (2040 Notes) during the year ended December 31, 2010. We exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our 5.400% notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) for $324.9 million aggregate principal amount of 5.253% (effective rate of 5.7%) notes due 2020 (2020 Notes) during the year ended December 31, 2010. Our strategic priorities for ensuring our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our retail channels, expanding our electronic channels to offer more choice and gain new consumers, developing new products and services for our consumers and improving our processes and productivity to help drive growth and improve our profitability. Significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include: Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue. The impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program. 41 Table of Contents Spin off from First Data We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax free distribution to First Data shareholders (Spin off) through this previously owned subsidiary. Basis of Presentation The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Transaction fees Transaction fees are charged for sending money transfers and for global business payments services. Consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent and received. Transaction fees represented 78% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Foreign exchange revenues In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different currencies, we generate revenues based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. Foreign exchange revenues growth has historically been primarily driven by growth in international cross currency transactions. As a result of the acquisition of Custom House, our foreign exchange revenues have increased. Foreign exchange revenues represented 20% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Commission and other revenues Commission and other revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer, money order and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets and enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator program (a recurring mortgage payment service program). Commission and other revenues represented 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010. As described above, prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were issued by IPS, from whom we received a commission. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders and no longer receive a commission from IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income derived from interest generated on money order settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets similar to our money transfer and payment services settlement assets. Cost of services Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represent approximately 70% of total cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses within these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative, or SGA, primarily consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses. Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans previously made to several existing agents. Interest expense Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings, including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps. 42 Table of Contents Derivative losses, net Represents the portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, which includes (a) differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates and (b) gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge. Although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement (i.e., spot rate changes), the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer to consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our international business to business payments operations. The impact of these contracts is classified within foreign exchange revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Other income, net Other income, net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity method investments and other income and expenses. Results of Operations The following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our Companys segments have been eliminated. We incurred expenses of $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 for restructuring and related activities, which have not been allocated to segments. No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in the corresponding period in 2009 and we incurred expenses of $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. While these items are identifiable to our segments, they are not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to Operating expenses overview. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $71.0 million settlement accrual, which was not allocated to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Selling, general and administrative expenses. 43 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. % Change Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 4,055.3 $ 4,036.2 $ 4,240.8 % (5 )% Foreign exchange revenues 1,018.8 910.3 896.3 12 % 2 % Commission and other revenues 118.6 137.1 144.9 (13 )% (5 )% Total revenues 5,192.7 5,083.6 5,282.0 2 % (4 )% Expenses: Cost of services 2,978.4 2,874.9 3,093.0 4 % (7 )% Selling, general and administrative 914.2 926.0 834.0 (1 )% 11 % Total expenses 3,892.6 3,800.9 3,927.0 2 % (3 )% Operating income 1,300.1 1,282.7 1,355.0 1 % (5 )% Other income/(expense): Interest income 2.8 9.4 45.2 (70 )% (79 )% Interest expense (169.9 ) (157.9 ) (171.2 ) 8 % (8 )% Derivative losses, net (2.5 ) (2.8 ) (6.9 ) * * Other income, net 14.7 0.1 16.6 * * Total other expense, net (154.9 ) (151.2 ) (116.3 ) 2 % 30 % Income before income taxes 1,145.2 1,131.5 1,238.7 1 % (9 )% Provision for income taxes 235.3 282.7 319.1 (17 )% (12 )% Net income $ 909.9 $ 848.8 $ 919.0 7 % (8 )% Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.37 $ 1.21 $ 1.26 13 % (4 )% Diluted $ 1.36 $ 1.21 $ 1.24 12 % (2 )% Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 666.5 698.9 730.1 Diluted 668.9 701.0 738.2 * Calculation not meaningful Revenues overview The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues were contributed by our consumer to consumer segment for all periods presented, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion. 2010 compared to 2009 Consolidated revenue increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 due to consumer to consumer transaction growth and the acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million to revenue in 2010 and $30.8 million in 2009. Transaction growth and incremental Custom House revenue were offset by price decreases, primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business (transactions between and within the United States and Canada) commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, declines in our United States bill payments businesses, geographic and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has a lower revenue per transaction, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue. The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia (EMEASA) region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 44% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced flat 44 Table of Contents revenue despite transaction growth. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar in the region compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue, and many of the same factors described above. The Americas region (including North America, Latin America, the Caribbean and South America) of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 31% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced revenue increases due to strong transaction growth, although the increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of 2009. The global business payments segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion, also experienced revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to our acquisition of Custom House, which was partially offset by declines in our United States bill payments businesses. Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 primarily due to foreign exchange revenues contributed from our acquisition of Custom House. In addition to the impact of Custom House, foreign exchange revenues in the consumer to consumer segment also grew, driven primarily by revenue from the international business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction of transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $36.8 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region. 2009 compared to 2008 Consolidated revenue declined 4% during the year ended December 31, 2009. The revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions, and price decreases. Also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue by approximately 3%, as discussed below. The EMEASA region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 45% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue declines and slower transaction growth rates during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The revenue declines were driven by most of the same factors discussed above. The acquisition of FEXCOs money transfer business did not have an impact on our revenue as we were already recognizing 100% of the revenue arising from money transfers originating at FEXCOs locations. The Americas region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009, experienced revenue and transaction declines due to the overall weak United States economy. Our Americas results were further impacted by pricing reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2009 which improved our transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in revenue. The global business payments segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion, also experienced revenue declines during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding prior period. Revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments businesses. Offsetting these declines in 2009 were the results of our Custom House acquisition, which contributed $30.8 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 primarily due to foreign exchange revenues from Business Solutions. Excluding the impact of Business Solutions, foreign exchange revenues decreased at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 45 Table of Contents 2009 of $119.5 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The impact to earnings per share during the period was less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program. The majority of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is related to the EMEASA region. Operating expenses overview The following factors impacted both cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses during the periods presented: Restructuring and Related Activities On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan) designed to reduce our overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities, primarily within the United States and Europe, to regional operating centers upon completion of the Restructuring Plan. In conjunction with this decision and subsequent revisions, we expect to incur approximately $50 million in additional expenses in 2011 related to the Restructuring Plan. The total expense for 2010 and 2011 of approximately $110 million consists of approximately $80 million for severance and employee related benefits, approximately $10 million for facility closures, including lease terminations; and approximately $20 million for other expenses. Included in these estimated expenses are approximately $2 million of non cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. Subject to complying with and undertaking the necessary individual and collective employee information and consultation obligations as may be required by local law for potentially affected employees, we expect all of these activities to be completed by the third quarter of 2011. Total cost savings of approximately $8 million were generated in 2010 and approximately $50 million is expected to be generated in 2011. Cost savings of approximately $70 million per year are expected to be generated beginning in 2012, following completion of the Restructuring Plan. For the year ended December 31, 2010, restructuring and related expenses of $15.0 million are classified within cost of services and $44.5 million are classified within selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income. No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, restructuring and related expenses of $62.8 million and $20.1 million are classified within cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. These restructuring and related expenses are associated with the closure of our facilities in Missouri and Texas and other reorganization plans executed in 2008. No expenses were recognized for these restructurings in 2009. Cost of services Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to incremental costs, including those related to Custom House, our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services; agent commissions, which primarily increase in relation to revenue increases; and restructuring and related expenses of $15.0 million, offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 57% for both of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as incremental operating costs, including costs associated with our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services, and restructuring and related expenses were offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense. Cost of services decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 primarily due to agent commissions, which decreased due to revenue declines, as well as reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of FEXCO and other selective consumer to consumer commission initiatives. Also impacting cost of services was the strengthening of the United States dollar for most of 2009 compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on the translation of our expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost savings. These costs were offset by incremental operating costs, including increased technology costs and costs associated with Custom House. Cost of 46 Table of Contents services as a percentage of revenue was 57% and 59% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the corresponding period in 2008 was generally due to reduced commissions resulting from the acquisition of FEXCO and selective consumer to consumer agent commission initiatives, restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 and the related 2009 cost savings, offset somewhat by incremental operating costs, including increased technology costs and costs associated with Custom House. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual that was recorded in 2009, as described below, lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies, offset by incremental costs associated with Custom House and our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment Services Directive, restructuring and related expenses of $44.5 million and higher employee compensation costs. SGA increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual described below, incremental costs associated with the acquisitions of FEXCO and Custom House including costs related to evaluating and closing these acquisitions and other increased operating expenses, offset by better leveraging of our marketing expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in 2008 which did not recur in 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State and requires us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico will participate with Arizona. The accrual includes amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, we expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and have engaged a monitor for those programs, which are expected to cost up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, marketing related expenditures, principally classified within SGA, were approximately 4%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of revenue. Marketing related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments, as discussed in Segment Discussion, for consumer to consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments. Total other expense, net Total other expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from our $250 million note issuance and financing costs incurred in connection with our note exchange, and a decrease in interest income due to lower short term interest rates and the repayment of a note receivable due from an agent. These amounts were partially offset by the recovery of $6.3 million of the $12 million reserve recorded in the prior year against our receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund due to the final settlement. Total other expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower short term interest rates and lower average interest bearing cash balances, the reserve taken against our receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund, Ltd. mentioned above and a decline in earnings on our equity method investments in 2009, primarily as a result of the absence of equity method earnings for FEXCO subsequent to the February 2009 acquisition date. Income taxes Our effective tax rates on pre tax income were 20.5%, 25.0% and 25.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived, 47 Table of Contents and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. In addition, during 2010, we have also benefitted from cumulative and ongoing tax planning benefits, including benefits related to certain previous foreign acquisitions, and from certain IRS settlements related to 2002 through 2004. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in 2003. As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $607.9 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related benefits. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows. The IRS completed its examination of the United States federal consolidated income tax returns of First Data for 2003 and 2004, of which we are a part, and issued a Notice of Deficiency in December 2008. The Notice of Deficiency alleges significant additional taxes, interest and penalties owed with respect to a variety of adjustments involving us and our subsidiaries, and we generally have responsibility for taxes associated with these potential Western Union related adjustments under the tax allocation agreement with First Data executed at the time of the spin off. We agree with a number of the adjustments in the Notice of Deficiency; however, we do not agree with the Notice of Deficiency regarding several substantial adjustments representing total alleged additional tax and penalties due of approximately $114 million. As of December 31, 2010, interest on the alleged amounts due for unagreed adjustments would be approximately $36 million. A substantial part of the alleged amounts due for these unagreed adjustments relates to our international restructuring, which took effect in the fourth quarter 2003, and, accordingly, the alleged amounts due related to such restructuring largely are attributable to 2004. On March 20, 2009, we filed a petition in the United States Tax Court contesting those adjustments with which we do not agree. In September 2010, IRS Counsel referred the case to the IRS Appeals Division for possible settlement. We believe our overall reserves are adequate, including those associated with adjustments alleged in the Notice of Deficiency. If the IRS position in the Notice of Deficiency is sustained, our tax provision related to 2003 and later years would materially increase, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, we made a $250 million refundable tax deposit relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. The $250 million refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction to Income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010. Earnings per share During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, basic earnings per share were $1.37, $1.21 and $1.26, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.36, $1.21 and $1.24, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were 34.0 million, 37.5 million and 8.0 million, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti dilutive. The increase in anti dilutive shares in 2010 and 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the majority of our outstanding options having an exercise price higher than our average market price for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the 37.5 million, 42.8 million and 43.6 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, approximately 35%, 40% and 47%, respectively, were held by employees of First Data. 48 Table of Contents Earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the corresponding previous period as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Earnings per share decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income, offset by lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The lower number of shares outstanding was due to stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises in both 2010 and 2009 compared to the corresponding periods in the prior years. Segment Discussion We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are consumer to consumer and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as Other. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our CODM are computed in accordance with the following principles: The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments revenue compared to total revenue. Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions are included in Other. We incurred expenses of $59.5 million and $82.9 million for restructuring and related activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, respectively, which were not allocated to segments. No expenses were recognized for restructurings and related activities in 2009. While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to Operating expenses overview. During 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from the multi state agreement and settlement, which was not allocated to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Operating expenses overview. All items not included in operating income are excluded. The following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consumer to consumer (a) EMEASA 44% 45% 44% Americas 31% 32% 34% APAC 9% 8% 7% Total consumer to consumer 84% 85% 85% Global business payments 14% 14% 14% Other 2% 1% 1% 100% 100% 100% 49 Table of Contents (a) The geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed to that region. Consumer to Consumer Segment The following table sets forth our consumer to consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. % Change Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 3,434.3 $ 3,373.5 $ 3,532.9 2 % (5 )% Foreign exchange revenues 905.8 877.1 893.1 3 % (2 )% Other revenues 43.3 50.1 45.6 (14 )% 10 % Total revenues $ 4,383.4 $ 4,300.7 $ 4,471.6 2 % (4 )% Operating income $ 1,243.3 $ 1,175.5 $ 1,222.7 6 % (4 )% Operating income margin 28 % 27 % 27 % Key indicator: Consumer to consumer transactions 213.7 196.1 188.1 9 % 4 % The table below sets forth transaction and revenue growth/(decline) rates by region for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Consumer to consumer transaction growth/(decline) (a): EMEASA 5 % 10 % Americas 11 % (3 )% APAC 14 % 18 % Consumer to consumer revenue growth/(decline) (a): EMEASA % (1 )% Americas 2 % (9 )% APAC 13 % 5 % (a) In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to that region. When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for individual countries in the following discussion, all transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of the revenue associated with each transaction to, from and within those countries are included. The countries of India and China combined represented approximately 7%, 7% and 6% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, represented more than approximately 6%, 6% and 7% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues 2010 compared to 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year, consumer to consumer money transfer revenue grew 2% primarily due to transaction growth of 9%. Transaction growth was offset by price decreases, primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, geographic and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue by approximately 1%. Our international consumer to consumer business experienced revenue growth of 3% on transaction growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the United States and Canada and transactions to and from Mexico. Our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States also experienced revenue growth on transaction increases for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenue in our EMEASA region remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year despite transaction growth of 5%. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors described above. Our European market experienced transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. In addition, for the full year ended December 31, 2010, revenue and transactions in the Gulf States declined moderately compared to the same period in 2009, however, both revenue and transactions grew in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the comparable period in the prior year. India had transaction growth of 4% and revenue growth of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the same period in 2009. Americas revenue increased 2% on transaction growth of 11% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to the pricing actions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our domestic business experienced revenue declines of 6% on transaction growth of 28% for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the same factors. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our domestic business experienced revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth of 29% as we reached the anniversary of the pricing reductions taken in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our United States outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Mexico business revenue was flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 on transaction growth of 2%. APAC revenue increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to transaction growth of 14%. Chinas revenue increased 10% on transaction growth of 7% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 grew compared to the prior year, driven primarily by revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $32.3 million over the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region. We have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account a variety of factors. Fee decreases and foreign exchange actions generally can reduce margins in the short term, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. For the year ended December 31, 2010, such fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately 4% of our total revenue compared to 2% and 1% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the full year 2010, approximately three fourths of these actions relate to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business. The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new agent locations will help 51 Table of Contents drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations. Send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location, migration patterns, the locations class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the more than 445,000 agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2010, more than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and Western Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer brands: Western Union, Orlandi Valutasm and Vigo) experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations, approximately 70% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions. 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer to consumer money transfer revenue declined 4% on transaction growth of 4% for the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008. The revenue decline was attributable to the weak global economy and slowing transaction growth, and to a lesser extent, geographic mix, product mix including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has lower revenue per transaction than cross border transactions, and price decreases. Also impacting the revenue decline was the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies for the majority of the year, which adversely impacted revenue by approximately 2%, as discussed below. Our international consumer to consumer business experienced a revenue decline of 1% on transaction growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States also experienced revenue declines on transaction increases for the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of the same factors described above. Revenue in our EMEASA region declined 1% during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to most of the same factors discussed above. Our largest European markets experienced revenue declines during most of the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. Our money transfer business to India for the year ended December 31, 2009 versus the same period in 2008 continued to grow with transaction growth of 22% and revenue growth of 11%. Revenue and transaction growth for both India and the Gulf States slowed throughout the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Due to the economic conditions in the Gulf States, transaction growth rates declined to single digits in the fourth quarter. Americas revenue and transactions declined for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Contributing to the overall decline in the Americas region was the domestic business which experienced a revenue decline of 14% on a transaction decline of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The repositioning of the domestic business, including pricing reductions taken in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved our Americas and domestic transaction volumes, but contributed to the decline in revenue. Our Mexico business also contributed to the overall decline in the Americas region with a revenue decline of 15% on a transaction decline of 12% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our United States domestic and Mexico business revenue declined due to the weak economy in the United States. Our Mexico revenues were also impacted by our closure of certain Vigo branded agents, substantially all of which were small retailers, due to credit concerns. However, the decline in revenue for our United States outbound business moderated in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the previous nine months of 2009 as a result of transaction growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our APAC revenue increased 5% on transaction growth of 18% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The APAC regions revenues have been impacted by translating foreign currency denominated revenues into the United States dollar, as further described below, as well as moderating transaction growth. China revenue grew 1% on 4% transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2009. 52 Table of Contents Foreign exchange revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the corresponding previous period at a rate relatively consistent with the decrease in our revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $101.3 million over the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. Operating income 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer to consumer operating income increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense, offset by higher employee compensation costs and incremental costs associated with our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment Services Directive. The increase in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from these same factors. 2009 compared to 2008 Consumer to consumer operating income decreased 4% during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the decline in revenue, incremental costs, including increased technology costs and the acquisition of FEXCO, offset somewhat by reduced agent commissions, savings realized from the 2008 restructurings and better leveraging of our marketing expenses, as described earlier. The operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 was consistent with 2008. Global Business Payments Segment The following table sets forth our global business payments segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. % Change Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 578.0 $ 621.9 $ 668.1 (7 )% (7 )% Foreign exchange revenues 113.0 33.2 3.2 * * Other revenues 30.7 36.6 48.5 (16 )% (25 )% Total revenues $ 721.7 $ 691.7 $ 719.8 4 % (4 )% Operating income $ 122.5 $ 171.9 $ 199.4 (29 )% (14 )% Operating income margin 17 % 25 % 28 % Key indicator: Global business payments transactions 404.9 414.8 412.1 (2 )% 1 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenues 2010 compared to 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2010, global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million of revenue in 2010 versus $30.8 million in 2009, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and growth in the Pago Fcil business. These increases were offset by revenue declines in our United States bill payments businesses as many United States consumers who would use our services continue to have difficulty paying their bills and continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form, resulting in us handling fewer bill payments. The ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the 53 Table of Contents United States and competitive pressures, which resulted in lower cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products, also contributed to the revenue declines. The transaction declines during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 were due to declines in our United States bill payments businesses. 2009 compared to 2008 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the global business payments segment revenue was adversely impacted by the weak economic situation in the United States, which resulted in a revenue decline in our United States cash and electronic bill payments businesses, partially offset by $30.8 million in revenue generated from our September 1, 2009 acquisition of Custom House and slight growth in the Pago Fcil business. The segments revenues were primarily generated in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2009. Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 was driven by our Pago Fcil cash based and United States electronic based bill payments businesses. Both of these businesses carry a lower revenue per transaction than our United States cash based bill payment business. The transaction growth was offset by a decline in the United States cash based bill payments business. Operating income 2010 compared to 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines related to the United States based bill payments business, and investing and operating costs, including amortization expense, associated with the acquisition of Custom House. The decline in operating income margin in the segment is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the acquisition of Custom House and declines in our United States bill payments businesses. 2009 compared to 2008 For the year ended December 31, 2009, operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to operating income declines related to the United States based bill payments business and operating and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Custom House, offset slightly by the savings generated from the 2008 restructurings. The decline in operating income margin in the segment is due to the factors described above and continues to be impacted by the decline in the United States cash based bill payments business which has a higher operating income margin than our South America and electronic businesses. Other The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. % Change Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Revenues $ 87.6 $ 91.2 $ 90.6 (4 )% 1 % Operating income $ (6.2 ) $ 6.3 $ 15.8 * (60 )% Operating income margin * 7 % 17 % * Calculation not meaningful Revenues 2010 compared to 2009 Revenue, generated primarily from our money order services business, declined for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year. We experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned 54 Table of Contents related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on outstanding money order balances as we did for the first three quarters of 2009. We now derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities. These securities generally have a lower rate of return than we were receiving under our previous agreement with IPS. In 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps on certain of our fixed rate notes to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Through a combination of the revenue generated from the new investment securities and the anticipated interest expense savings resulting from the interest rate swaps, we estimate that we should be able to retain a materially comparable after tax rate of return through 2011 as we had been receiving under the agreement with IPS. 2009 compared to 2008 Revenue remained relatively consistent with prior year and is comprised primarily of our money order services business. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned related to our money order services business due to the change in our agreement with IPS described above. Operating income 2010 compared to 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our money order services business, as described above, and an increase in promotional marketing activities related to our prepaid business in the United States. In 2009, we also incurred additional costs associated with evaluating and closing acquisitions compared to 2010. 2009 compared to 2008 During the year ended December 31, 2009, the decrease in operating income was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions and a decline in our money order services business due to the decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 as described above. Further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, timing of income tax payments, including our refundable tax deposit described further in Cash Flows from Operating Activities and collections on receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters, and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant population, and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters. A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use, except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions. The assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions of approximately $210 million include those located in countries outside of the United States containing restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries and cash and investment balances that are maintained by a regulated subsidiary to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the United States in accordance with applicable state regulations. Significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity. 55 Table of Contents We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including the pending acquisition of Angelo Costa S.r.l., dividends, and share repurchases, through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations. In addition, we have capacity to borrow up to $1.5 billion in the aggregate under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, which were not drawn on as of and during the year ended December 31, 2010. The revolving credit facility expires in September 2012. Cash and Investment Securities As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion was held by our foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash balances to fluctuate. Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations. Investment securities, classified within settlement assets, were $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. Substantially all of these investments are state and municipal debt securities. Most state regulators in the United States require us to maintain specific high quality, investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations. Substantially all of our investment securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value. Under the Payment Services Directive (PSD) in the European Union, we expect to have a similar portfolio of investment securities, which we will manage in a similar manner and under similar guidelines as our current portfolio. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments, including diversifying our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2010, the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2010, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security was less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $994.4 million, $1,218.1 million and $1,253.9 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to a $250.0 million refundable tax deposit made relating to potential United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such potential tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to lower net income, offset by working capital fluctuations in 2009, including the settlement accrual and timing of tax payments. 56 Table of Contents Financing Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions): December 31, 2010 Due in less than one year (a): 5.400% notes (effective rate of 2.7%) due November 2011 (b) (c) $ 696.3 Due in greater than one year (a): 6.500% notes (effective rate of 5.5%) due 2014 500.0 5.930% notes due 2016 (d) 1,000.0 5.253% notes due 2020 (b) 324.9 6.200% notes due 2036 (d) 500.0 6.200% notes due 2040 (e) 250.0 Other borrowings 5.9 Total borrowings at par value 3,277.1 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments, net (a) 36.6 Unamortized discount, net (b) (23.8 ) Total borrowings at carrying value (f) $ 3,289.9 (a) We utilize interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of our notes from fixed rate payments to short term LIBOR based variable rate payments in order to manage our overall exposure to interest rates. The changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the related note. These hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in interest expense over the life of the related notes, and cause the effective rate of interest to differ from the notes stated rate. (b) On March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of the 5.400% notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) for 5.253% unsecured notes due 2020 (2020 Notes). The 5.7% effective interest rate of the 2020 Notes differs from the stated rate as the notes have a par value of $324.9 million. The $21.2 million difference between the carrying value and the par value is being accreted over the life of the 2020 Notes. See below for additional detail relating to the note exchange. (c) The effective interest rate related to the 2011 Notes includes the impact of the interest rate swaps entered into in conjunction with the assumption of the money order investments from IPS. (d) The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant. (e) On June 21, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 6.200% unsecured notes due 2040 (the 2040 Notes). In anticipation of this issuance, we entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate of the debt issuance, and recorded a loss on the swaps of $7.5 million, which increased the effective rate to 6.3%, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the 2040 Notes. See below for additional detail relating to the debt issuance. (f) At December 31, 2010, our weighted average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 5.2%. Commercial Paper Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. We had no commercial paper borrowings as of and during the year ended December 31, 2010. Revolving Credit Facility Our revolving credit facility expires in September 2012 and includes a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). 57 Table of Contents Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 19 basis points. A facility fee of 6 basis points on the total facility is payable quarterly regardless of usage. The facility fee percentage is determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, to the extent the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 50% of the related aggregate commitments, a utilization fee of 5 basis points as of December 31, 2010 based upon such ratings is payable to the lenders on the aggregate outstanding borrowings. The interest rate margin, facility fee and utilization fee are all based on certain of our credit ratings. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings on this facility and had $1.5 billion available to borrow. Our revolving credit facility, which is diversified through a group of 15 participating institutions, is used to provide general liquidity for us and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.5 billion is approximately 20%. The substantial majority of the banks within this group were rated at least an A or better as of December 31, 2010. If the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased, or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted. Notes On June 21, 2010, we issued $250 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040. Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semiannually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points. On March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our 2011 Notes for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020. Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into interest expense over the life of the notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points. On February 26, 2009, we issued $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our 2014 Notes. Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semiannually on February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. On November 17, 2006, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.400% Notes due 2011 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.200% Notes due 2036 (the 2036 Notes). Interest with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2036 Notes is payable semiannually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on fixed per annum interest rates of 5.400% and 6.200%, respectively. We may redeem the 2011 Notes and the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. On September 29, 2006, we issued $1 billion of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on a fixed per annum interest rate of 5.930%. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and overall business risks. 58 Table of Contents Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin, facility fee and utilization fee, all of which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions in our 2014 Notes, 2040 Notes and certain of our derivative contracts which would require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2010: December 31, 2010 SP Moodys Fitch Short term rating A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured A A3 A Ratings outlook Stable Stable Stable These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following: Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated; We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings; Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease; Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and Our agent relationships may be adversely impacted, particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices. The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants which, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2011 Notes, 2016 Notes, 2020 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation expense, (d) amortization expense, (e) any other non cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net income for such period and (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in accordance with United States GAAP for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 9:1 for the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow, and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes. Cash Priorities Liquidity Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with our current credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available to support the needs of our business. 59 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment, and purchased and developed software was $113.7 million, $98.9 million and $153.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during 2010, 2009 and 2008 included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software. Acquisition of Businesses In December 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 70% interest which we currently do not own in Angelo Costa S.r.l. (Costa), one of our largest money transfer agents in Europe. We will acquire the 70% interest for cash of 100 million (approximately $133 million based on currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010), less a working capital deficiency adjustment to be determined at closing. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2011, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions. On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada based Custom House, a provider of international business to business payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million for all of the common shares of this business and acquired cash of $2.5 million. On February 24, 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of European based FEXCO Group Holdings (FEXCO Group), one of our largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group and paid 123.1 million ($157.4 million) as consideration for all of the common shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of $11.8 million. In December 2008, we acquired 80% of our existing money transfer agent in Peru for a purchase price of $35.0 million. The aggregate consideration paid was $29.7 million, net of a holdback reserve of $3.0 million and cash acquired of $2.3 million. On August 1, 2008, we acquired the money transfer assets from our existing money transfer agent in Panama for a purchase price of $18.3 million, which is net of cash acquired. The consideration paid was $14.3 million, net of a holdback reserve of $4.0 million. We expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies, particularly outside of the United States, to further complement and strengthen our existing businesses worldwide. Share Repurchases and Dividends During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 35.6 million, 24.8 million and 58.1 million, respectively, of shares were repurchased for $584.5 million, $400.0 million and $1,313.9 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $16.44, $16.10 and $22.60 per share, respectively. At December 31, 2010, $415.5 million remains available under share repurchase authorizations approved by our Board of Directors. On February 1, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion of common stock repurchases through December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share in each of the first three quarters representing $165.3 million in total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share representing $41.2 million in total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors declared an annual cash dividend of $0.04 per common share representing $28.4 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective month the dividend was declared, except for the September 2010 declared dividend, which was paid in October 2010. Debt Service Requirements Our 2011 debt service requirements will include $696.3 million of our 5.400% notes maturing in November 2011, payments on future borrowings under our commercial paper program, if any, and interest payments on all 60 Table of Contents outstanding indebtedness. However, as market conditions allow, we may refinance all or a portion of the 2011 Notes with new financing sources. We have the ability to use existing financing sources, including our cash, Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program, to meet obligations as they arise. Based on market conditions at the time such refinancing could occur, we may not be able to obtain new financing under similar conditions as historically reported. Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Pension Plan On December 31, 2010, we merged our two frozen defined benefit pension plans into one Plan (the Plan). The Plan assets were held in a master trust and were identical in terms of their benefit entitlements and other provisions (except for participant eligibility requirements) and consequently, the financial effect of the merger was not significant. Our Plan had a recorded unfunded pension obligation of $112.8 million as of December 31, 2010. In 2010 we made approximately $25 million in contributions to the Plan, including a discretionary contribution of $10 million. Due to the closure of one of our facilities in Missouri and an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, we funded $4.1 million during 2009. No contributions were made to the Plan during the year ended December 31, 2008. We will be required to fund approximately $22 million to the Plan in 2011 and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $3 million. Our most recent measurement date for our pension plans was December 31, 2010. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions: 1) expected long term return on plan assets; and 2) discount rate. We employ a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification, re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. Our expected long term return on plan assets was 6.50% for 2010 and 7.50% for 2009. The expected long term return on plan assets is 7.00% for 2011. In early 2011 we revised our target asset allocation to approximately 15% in equity investments, 60% in fixed income securities and 25% in alternative investment strategies in order to increase diversification. The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 4.69% and 5.30% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense. 61 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Items related to amounts included on our balance sheet: Borrowings, including interest (a) $ 5,166.8 $ 876.7 $ 314.1 $ 752.2 $ 3,223.8 Unrecognized tax benefits (b) 671.1 Estimated pension funding (c) 124.6 22.1 45.0 38.3 19.2 Foreign currency derivative contracts (d) 80.9 69.7 9.6 1.6 Other (e) 12.6 4.7 5.2 2.7 Other Contractual Obligations: Purchase obligations (f) 148.9 52.5 47.0 34.4 15.0 Operating leases 105.9 29.9 38.4 22.6 15.0 Other (g) 152.0 140.0 12.0 $ 6,462.8 $ 1,195.6 $ 471.3 $ 851.8 $ 3,273.0 (a) We have estimated our interest payments based on (i) the assumption that we will continue to have no commercial paper borrowings outstanding (ii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes, although we intend to refinance in 2011 the remaining balance of $696.3 million of our 5.400% Notes which are scheduled to mature in November 2011 and (iii) an estimate of future interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements based on projected LIBOR rates. (b) Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control. (c) We have estimated our pension plan funding requirements, including interest, using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates. The unfunded pension liability included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the present value of the estimated pension plan funding requirements disclosed above. The actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $3.0 million to the plan in 2011, which has not been reflected in the table above. (d) Represents the liability position of our foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2010, which will fluctuate based on market conditions. (e) This line item relates to accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of December 31, 2010. (f) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a terminations penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. Obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. (g) This line item primarily relates to the agreement we entered into on December 31, 2010 to acquire the remaining 70% interest, which we currently do not own, in Angelo Costa S.r.l., one of our largest money transfer agents in Europe. We will acquire the 70% interest for cash of 100 million (approximately $133 million based on currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010), less a working capital adjustment 62 Table of Contents to be determined at closing. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2011, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions. This line item also includes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border, which are expected to cost up to $19 million over the next three years pursuant to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. Other Commercial Commitments We had $85 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at December 31, 2010, with expiration dates through 2015, the majority of which contain a one year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. 63 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition. Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Income Taxes Reinvestment of foreign earnings Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments. With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined United States federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely. At December 31, 2010, no provision had been made for United States federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of approximately $2.5 billion, which are expected to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely.Upon distribution of those earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 64 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Income tax contingencies We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations, which were restructured in 2003. Our tax reserves reflect managements judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2010 were $607.9 million, including interest and penalties, net of related benefits. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, particularly with respect to our 2003 restructuring of our international operations, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the spin off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection with the spin off from First Data, we believe we have appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us. 65 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Derivative Financial Instruments We utilize derivatives to (a) minimize our exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross currency business to business payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges.Cash Flow hedges Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted money transfer revenues and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting t he change in fair value of the hedged item. The portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in Derivative (losses)/gains, net.Fair Value hedges Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense. The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements.The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly.If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results.As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative pre tax unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $31.8 million.As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a $36.6 million gain. 66 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Other Intangible Assets We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as well as acquired intangible assets and software.We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value (normally measured by discounted cash flows) is required. The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract.The estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions including among other things revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans. Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset.If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge.The net carrying value of our other intangible assets at December 31, 2010 was $438.0 million. 67 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Goodwill Impairment Testing We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill, by comparing the reporting units fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds i ts implied fair value, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.Reporting units are driven by the level at which segment management reviews operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment (e.g., Consumer to Consumer money transfer) and in others it is one level below the operating segment (e.g., Business Solutions, which is included in our global business payments segment). We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace and other economic factors.The determination of the reporting units also requires judgment. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change.If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the periods such charge occurs.The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2010 was $2,151.7 million which represented approximately 27% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2010, goodwill of $1,619.9 million and $264.3 million resides in our Consumer to Consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively.For the Consumer to Consumer reporting unit, the fair value of the business greatly exceeds its ca rrying amount that providing sensitivity is not meaningful. For the Business Solutions reporting unit, a decline in estimated fair value of up to 15% could occur before triggering an impairment of goodwill. A decline of 30% would trigger an impairment of approximately $55 million. We expect that such a fair value decline would be driven primarily by actual and forecasted revenues that do not meet expectations. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2010. 68 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.For most acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as agent networks, customer relationships, tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of one year or less as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Purchase price allocation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. During the last three years, we completed the following significant acquisitions: In September 2009, we acquired Custom House for $371.0 million. In February 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of FEXCO for $243.6 million. See Note 4, Acquisitions, to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information related to the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed during the last three years. If estimates or assumptions used to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made, the allocation of purchase price between goodwill and intangibles could significantly differ. Such a difference would impact future earnings through amortization expense of these intangibles. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments could arise, as discussed further in Goodwill Impairment Testing and Other Intangible Assets above. For all of our acquisitions during the three years ended December 31, 2010, goodwill of $496.2 million and intangibles of $208.7 million were recognized. 69 Table of Contents Effect if Actual Results Differ from Description Judgments and Uncertainties Assumptions Restructuring and Related Expenses We have engaged in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. We also evaluate impairment issues associated with restructuring activities.Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and incremental costs associated with restructuring and related activities, including severance, outplacement and other employee related benefits; facility closure and migration of IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to existing Company facilities and third party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs and acceleration of depreciation. These costs represent managements best estimate, until all such amounts are paid and settled. As such, these costs require assumptions about the activities that may change over time.The decision to include a cost in the restructuring disclosure requires an assessment of whether the cost is direct and incremental to the productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. This assessment can require judgment depending on the nature of the cost.The timing of recording these costs was determined by the applicable accounting guidance. This judgment significantly impacted the timing of the recognition of restructuring and related expenses on a quarterly basis and between the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. The restructuring and related expenses are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring and related expenses could be materially impacted.For the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses, of which $35.4 million remains unpaid. We expect to incur approximately $50 million in additional restructuring and related expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. 70 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We provide consumer to consumer money transfer services in 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany loans. In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consumer to consumer revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international consumer to consumer operations. With the acquisition of Custom House in the third quarter of 2009, our foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management has increased due to the nature of this business. The significant majority of Custom Houses revenue, now known as Western Union Business Solutions (Business Solutions), is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments. This business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Our Business Solutions business aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre tax annual income of approximately $32 million and $27 million, respectively, based on our forecast of unhedged exposure to foreign currency at those dates. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. Interest Rates We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a total value at December 31, 2010 of $3.3 billion. Approximately $2.5 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. These assets primarily include money market funds and state and municipal variable rate securities 71 Table of Contents and are included in our consolidated balance sheets within cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets. To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as settlement assets. Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Substantially all of the remainder of our interest bearing assets consist of fixed rate instruments, the substantial majority of which are highly rated state and municipal debt securities. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment services awaiting redemption classified within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed rate interest bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available for sale within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our total stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2010, $1.2 billion of our total $3.3 billion in borrowings was effectively floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing our fixed rate debt to LIBOR based floating rate debt, with average spreads of approximately 500 basis points above LIBOR. Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. No commercial paper borrowings were outstanding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs, and optimize returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets, as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. At December 31, 2010, our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings outstanding, including our hedges, was approximately 5.2%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre tax income of approximately $12 million and $8 million annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on December 31, 2010 and 2009 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting benefit/reduction to pre tax income of approximately $25 million and $20 million annually, respectively. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. Credit Risk Our interest earning assets include investment securities, substantially all of which are state and municipal debt securities, which are classified in settlement assets and accounted for as available for sale securities, and money market fund investments, which are classified in cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. Since January 1, 2009, we also limit our investment level to no more than $100 million with respect to individual money market funds. 72 Table of Contents We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk in bill payment and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our internet services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to chargebacks, insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses. Our losses associated with bad debts have been less than 1% of our revenues in all periods presented. We are also exposed to credit risk relating to derivative financial instruments written by us to our customers in our Business Solutions business. The duration of these derivative contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. To mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis and we may require certain customers to post collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the customers contract and their risk profile. The credit risk arising from our spot foreign currency exchange contracts is largely mitigated, as in most cases we require the receipt of funds from our customers before releasing the associated cross currency payment. 73 Table of Contents
