ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains certain statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See Risk Factors and Forward looking Statements. Overview We are a leading provider of money movement services, operating in two business segments: Consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency, real time money transfer processing systems. This service is available for international cross border transfers that is, the transfer of funds from one country to another and, in certain countries, intra country transfers that is, money transfers from one location to another in the same country. Global business payments the processing of payments from consumers or businesses to other businesses. Our business payments services allow consumers to make payments to a variety of organizations including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. Our existing Western Union Business Solutions business (Business Solutions) and Travelex Global Business Payments (TGBP), which was acquired in November 2011, are also included in this segment. These businesses facilitate business to business payments, primarily for cross border, cross currency transactions. The majority of the segments revenue was generated in the United States during all periods presented. However, international expansion and other key strategic initiatives, including TGBP, have resulted in international revenue continuing to increase in this segment. Businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as Other and represented 2% or less of consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Significant Financial and Other Highlights Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2011 included: We generated $5,491.4 million in total consolidated revenues compared to $5,192.7 million in the prior year, representing a year over year increase of 6%. The acquisition of TGBP contributed $35.2 million to revenue for 2011. We incurred $46.8 million and $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses as described within Operating expenses overview in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We generated $1,385.0 million in consolidated operating income compared to $1,300.1 million in the prior year, representing an increase of 7%. The results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above. 47 Table of Contents Our operating income margin was 25% during the year ended December 31, 2011, which is flat year over year. These results include the restructuring and related expenses mentioned above. We completed three acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2011: In April 2011, we completed the acquisition of one of our largest agents, European based Angelo Costa, S.r.l. (Costa), for cash consideration of $135.7 million. We recognized a pre tax gain of $29.4 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interest in Costa to fair value. In October 2011, we completed the acquisition of one of our largest agents, European based Finint S.r.l. (Finint), for cash consideration of $139.4 million. We recognized a pre tax gain of $20.5 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interest in Finint to fair value. In November 2011, we completed the acquisition of the business to business payment business known as TGBP from Travelex Holdings Limited for cash consideration of $967.8 million. In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS Agreement) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter. Consolidated net income was $1,165.4 million and $909.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing a year over year increase of 28%. In addition to the tax benefit described above, the results include $32.0 million and $39.3 million in restructuring and related expense, net of tax, respectively. Additionally, for 2011, we recognized gains of $12.7 million and $18.3 million, net of tax, related to our acquisitions of Finint and Costa, respectively, and $13.5 million, net of tax, related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition. Our consumers transferred $81 billion and $76 billion in consumer to consumer principal for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $73 billion and $69 billion related to cross border principal, which represented an increase of 7% in both consumer to consumer principal and cross border principal over the prior year. Consolidated cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,174.9 million and $994.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 were impacted by a $250 million tax deposit we made relating to United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. Our strategic priorities for ensuring our long term success include accelerating profitable growth in our retail channels, developing new products and services for our consumers, including expanding our electronic channel offerings to offer more choice and gain new consumers, expanding our business to business payments solutions, and improving our processes and productivity to help drive growth and improve our profitability. Significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations include: Transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses. Transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by, among other things, the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, a reduction in the size of the migrant population, interruptions in migration 48 Table of Contents patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws, economic development patterns or political events, could adversely affect our transaction volume. For discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods, refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below. Revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers, the principal sent per transaction and by the variance in the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. We intend to continue to implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account growth opportunities and including competitive factors. Decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins in the near term, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. A majority of our cost structure is comprised of agent commissions, which are generally variable and fluctuate as revenues fluctuate. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and other currencies impact our transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue. The impact to earnings per share is less than the revenue impact due to the translation of expenses and our foreign currency hedging program. Spin off from First Data We were incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Data on February 17, 2006. On September 29, 2006, First Data distributed all of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses and its interest in a Western Union money transfer agent, as well as its related assets, including real estate, through a tax free distribution to First Data shareholders (Spin off) through this previously owned subsidiary. Basis of Presentation The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Components of Revenues and Expenses The following briefly describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in Item 8, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Transaction fees Transaction fees are charged for sending consumer to consumer money transfers and for global business payments services. Consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent and received. Transaction fees represented 77% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. Foreign exchange revenues In certain consumer to consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different currencies, we generate revenues based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency. In our consumer to consumer business, foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by international consumer to consumer cross currency transactions. Also, as a result of the acquisitions of Custom House, Ltd. (Custom House) and TGBP, our foreign exchange revenues have increased. Foreign exchange revenues represented 21% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. 49 Table of Contents Other revenues Other revenues primarily consist of commissions and fees we receive in connection with the sale of money orders, investment income primarily derived from interest generated on consumer to consumer money transfer, money order and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets and enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our Equity Accelerator program (a recurring mortgage payment service program). Other revenues represented 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Prior to October 1, 2009, our money orders were issued by Integrated Payment Systems Inc. (IPS), a subsidiary of First Data, from whom we received a commission. Effective October 1, 2009, we assumed the responsibility for issuing money orders and no longer receive a commission from IPS. We now recognize fees and investment income derived from interest generated on money order settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets similar to our consumer to consumer money transfer and payment services settlement assets. Cost of services Cost of services primarily consists of agent commissions, which represent approximately 70% of total cost of services, and expenses for call centers, settlement operations, and related information technology costs. Expenses within these functions include personnel, software, equipment, telecommunications, bank fees, depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, primarily consists of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel, as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses. Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans previously made to certain existing agents. Interest expense Interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings, including applicable amounts associated with interest rate swaps. Derivative gains/(losses), net Represents the portion of the change in fair value of foreign currency accounting hedges that is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, which includes (a) differences between changes in forward rates and spot rates and (b) gains or losses on the contract and any offsetting positions during periods in which the instrument is not designated as a hedge. We also include in this line item changes in the fair value of derivative contracts, consisting of forward contracts with maturities of less than one year entered into to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies. Although the majority of changes in the value of our hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until settlement (i.e., spot rate changes), the remaining portion of changes in value are recognized in income as they occur. Derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our consumer to consumer money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions. Gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Derivative gains and losses also do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward and option contracts used in our business to business payments operations. The impact of these contracts is classified within Foreign exchange revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other income, net Other income, net is comprised primarily of gains on revaluation of equity interests, equity earnings from equity method investments and miscellaneous income and expenses. Results of Operations The following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment results refers to the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment 50 Table of Contents results of operations, which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated Statements of Income. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our Companys segments have been eliminated. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we reached an agreement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter. For additional information, refer to Income taxes. We incurred expenses of $46.8 million and $59.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for restructuring and related activities, which have not been allocated to segments. No restructuring and related expenses were recognized in the corresponding period in 2009. While these items are identifiable to our segments, they are not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities refer to Operating expenses overview. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a $71.0 million settlement accrual, which was not allocated to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Selling, general and administrative expenses. 51 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 4,220.2 $ 4,055.3 $ 4,036.2 4% 0% Foreign exchange revenues 1,151.2 1,018.8 910.3 13% 12% Other revenues 120.0 118.6 137.1 1% (13)% Total revenues 5,491.4 5,192.7 5,083.6 6% 2% Expenses: Cost of services 3,102.0 2,978.4 2,874.9 4% 4% Selling, general and administrative 1,004.4 914.2 926.0 10% (1)% Total expenses 4,106.4 3,892.6 3,800.9 5% 2% Operating income 1,385.0 1,300.1 1,282.7 7% 1% Other income/(expense): Interest income 5.2 2.8 9.4 86% (70)% Interest expense (181.9 ) (169.9 ) (157.9 ) 7% 8% Derivative gains/(losses), net 14.0 (2.5 ) (2.8 ) * * Other income, net 52.3 14.7 0.1 * * Total other expense, net (110.4 ) (154.9 ) (151.2 ) (29)% 2% Income before income taxes 1,274.6 1,145.2 1,131.5 11% 1% Provision for income taxes 109.2 235.3 282.7 (54)% (17)% Net income $ 1,165.4 $ 909.9 $ 848.8 28% 7% Earnings per share: Basic $ 1.85 $ 1.37 $ 1.21 35% 13% Diluted $ 1.84 $ 1.36 $ 1.21 35% 12% Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 630.6 666.5 698.9 Diluted 634.2 668.9 701.0 * Calculation not meaningful Revenues overview The majority of transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues were contributed by our consumer to consumer segment for all periods presented, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion. 2011 compared to 2010 Consolidated revenue increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2011 due to consumer to consumer transaction growth and the weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which positively impacted revenue, offset by slight price reductions. The weakening of the United States dollar 52 Table of Contents compared to most other foreign currencies positively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1% in the year ended December 31, 2011. The acquisition of TGBP contributed $35.2 million or 1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia (EMEASA) region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 43% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, experienced revenue growth primarily driven by most of the same factors described above. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Gulf States continued to experience revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2011, which was partially offset by softness in Southern Europe and Russia and declines resulting from the political unrest in Libya and the Ivory Coast. The Americas region (including North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America) of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 32% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011, experienced revenue growth due to transaction growth, slightly offset by pricing reductions. Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increasing foreign exchange revenues in our consumer to consumer segment, driven primarily by the increased amount of cross border principal sent. Additionally, foreign exchange revenues were positively impacted by the acquisition of TGBP and revenue growth experienced in our existing Business Solutions business. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a benefit to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $38.0 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest benefit was related to the EMEASA region. 2010 compared to 2009 Consolidated revenue increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 due to consumer to consumer transaction growth and the acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million to revenue in 2010 and $30.8 million in 2009. Transaction growth and incremental Custom House revenue were offset by price decreases, primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business (transactions between and within the United States and Canada) commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, declines in our United States bill payments businesses, geographic and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, which has a lower revenue per transaction, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue. The EMEASA region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 44% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced flat revenue despite transaction growth. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar in the region compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue, and many of the same factors described above. The Americas region of our consumer to consumer segment, which represented 31% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010, experienced revenue increases due to strong transaction growth, although the increase was mostly offset by the impact of pricing actions taken in our domestic business in the fourth quarter of 2009. The global business payments segment, which is discussed in greater detail in Segment Discussion, also experienced revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to our acquisition of Custom House, which was partially offset by declines in our United States cash based bill payments businesses. 53 Table of Contents Foreign exchange revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 primarily due to foreign exchange revenues contributed from our acquisition of Custom House. In addition to the impact of Custom House, foreign exchange revenues in the consumer to consumer segment also grew, driven primarily by revenue from the international business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction of transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $36.8 million over the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region. Operating expenses overview Restructuring and related activities On May 25, 2010 and as subsequently revised, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan) designed to reduce our overall headcount and migrate positions from various facilities, primarily within North America and Europe, to regional operating centers. As of September 30, 2011, we had incurred all of the expenses related to this Restructuring Plan. Total expense incurred under the Restructuring Plan for the period from May 25, 2010 through December 31, 2011 was $106 million, consisting of $75 million for severance and employee related benefits, $5 million for facility closures, including lease terminations, and $26 million for other expenses. Included in these expenses are $2 million of non cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. Total cost savings of approximately $55 million were generated in 2011. Cost savings of approximately $70 million are expected to be generated in 2012 and annually thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, restructuring and related expenses of $10.6 million and $15.0 million, respectively, are classified within Cost of services and $36.2 million and $44.5 million, respectively, are classified within Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of services Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to agent commissions, which increase in relation to revenue increases, the weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a negative impact on the translation of our expenses, and incremental operating costs associated with TGBP, partially offset by commission savings resulting from the acquisitions of Finint and Costa, and the lowering of certain other agent commission rates. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 56% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to commission savings resulting from the acquisitions of Finint and Costa, offset by negative currency impacts. Cost of services increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to incremental costs, including those related to Custom House, our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services; agent commissions, which primarily increase in relation to revenue increases; and restructuring and related expenses of $15.0 million, offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 57% for both years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as incremental operating costs, including costs associated with our money order business and advancing our electronic channel initiatives, including our web and account based money transfer services, and restructuring and related expenses were offset by operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense. 54 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased expenses resulting from the acquisitions of TGBP, Finint and Costa, including deal and integration costs associated with these acquisitions, investments in strategic initiatives, and the weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which resulted in a negative impact on the translation of our expenses, partially offset by restructuring savings. SG&A decreased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the settlement accrual that was recorded in 2009, as described below, lower marketing related expenditures and operating efficiencies, offset by incremental costs associated with Custom House and our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment Services Directive, restructuring and related expenses of $44.5 million and higher employee compensation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million for an agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. On February 11, 2010, we signed this agreement and settlement, which resolved all outstanding legal issues and claims with the State of Arizona and required us to fund a multi state not for profit organization promoting safety and security along the United States and Mexico border, in which California, Texas and New Mexico are participating with Arizona. The accrual included amounts for reimbursement to the State of Arizona for its costs associated with this matter. In addition, as part of the agreement and settlement, we have made and expect to make certain investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border and a monitor has been engaged for those programs. The costs of the investments in our programs and for the monitor are expected to reach up to $23 million over the period from signing to 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, marketing related expenditures, principally classified within SG&A, were approximately 4.1%, 4.1%, and 4.7%, respectively, of revenue. Marketing related expenditures include advertising, events, loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities. When making decisions with respect to marketing investments, we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for fee adjustments, as discussed in Segment Discussion, for consumer to consumer revenues and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments. Total other expense, net Total other expense, net decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the gains of $20.5 million and $29.4 million in connection with the remeasurement of our former equity interests in Finint and Costa, respectively, to fair value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized a $20.8 million net gain on foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of less than one year entered into in order to reduce the economic variability related to the cash amounts used to fund acquisitions of businesses with purchase prices denominated in foreign currencies, primarily for the TGBP acquisition. These amounts were partially offset by increased interest expense in 2011 due to our debt issuances. Total other expense, net increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from our $250 million note issuance and financing costs incurred in connection with our note exchange, and a decrease in interest income due to lower short term interest rates and the repayment of a note receivable due from an agent. These amounts were partially offset by the recovery of $6.3 million of the $12 million reserve recorded in the prior year against our receivable from the Reserve International Liquidity Fund due to the final settlement. 55 Table of Contents Income taxes Our effective tax rates on pre tax income were 8.6%, 20.5% and 25.0% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003, as described below, slightly offset by higher taxes associated with the Finint and Costa remeasurement gains. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a cumulative tax planning benefit from certain foreign acquisitions and the settlement with the IRS of certain issues relating to the 2002 2004 tax years. We continue to benefit from an increasing proportion of profits being foreign derived, and therefore taxed at lower rates than our combined federal and state tax rates in the United States. In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we expect to make cash payments in 2012 of approximately $190 million, which are in addition to the $250 million tax deposit we made with the IRS in 2010. This deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to our related tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. The $250 million refundable tax deposit is recorded as a reduction to Income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011. Also as a result of the IRS Agreement, we recognized a tax benefit of $204.7 million related to the adjustment of reserves associated with this matter. We also expect the settlement with the IRS to result in a lower effective tax rate in future years. We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. As of December 31, 2011, the total amount of tax contingency reserves was $135.0 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related benefits. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in facts and circumstances (i.e. new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods and could impact our operating cash flows. Earnings per share During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, basic earnings per share were $1.85, $1.37 and $1.21, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.84, $1.36 and $1.21, respectively. Unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested. As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were 17.1 million, 34.0 million and 37.5 million, respectively, of outstanding options to purchase shares of Western Union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect was anti dilutive. Of the 30.7 million, 37.5 million and 42.8 million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, approximately 32%, 35% and 40%, respectively, were held by employees of First Data. Earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the corresponding previous periods, respectively, as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income, mainly from the tax related benefit discussed above, and lower weighted average shares outstanding. Earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the corresponding previous periods, respectively, as a result of the previously described factors impacting net income and lower weighted average shares outstanding. The lower number of shares outstanding was due to stock repurchases exceeding stock option exercises. 56 Table of Contents Segment Discussion We manage our business around the consumers and businesses we serve and the types of services we offer. Each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups, distribution networks and services offered. Our segments are consumer to consumer and global business payments. Businesses not considered part of these segments are categorized as Other. The business segment measurements provided to, and evaluated by, our CODM are computed in accordance with the following principles: The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Corporate and other overhead is allocated to the segments primarily based on a percentage of the segments revenue compared to total revenue. Expenses incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions are included in Other. We incurred expenses of $46.8 million and $59.5 million for restructuring and related activities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which were not allocated to segments. No expenses were recognized for restructuring and related activities in 2009. While these items were identifiable to our segments, they were not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on restructuring and related activities, refer to Operating expenses overview. During 2009, we recorded an accrual of $71.0 million resulting from the multi state agreement and settlement, which was not allocated to the segments. While this item was identifiable to our consumer to consumer segment, it was not included in the measurement of segment operating profit provided to the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. For additional information on the settlement accrual, refer to Operating expenses overview. All items not included in operating income are excluded from the segments. The following table sets forth the components of segment revenues as a percentage of the consolidated totals for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Consumer to consumer (a) EMEASA 43 % 44 % 45 % Americas 32 % 31 % 32 % APAC 9 % 9 % 8 % Total consumer to consumer 84 % 84 % 85 % Global business payments 14 % 14 % 14 % Other 2 % 2 % 1 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (a) The consumer to consumer geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue is attributed to that region. 57 Table of Contents Consumer to Consumer Segment The following table sets forth our consumer to consumer segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 3,580.2 $ 3,434.3 $ 3,373.5 4 % 2 % Foreign exchange revenues 983.1 905.8 877.1 9 % 3 % Other revenues 45.1 43.3 50.1 4 % (14 )% Total revenues $ 4,608.4 $ 4,383.4 $ 4,300.7 5 % 2 % Operating income $ 1,316.0 $ 1,243.3 $ 1,175.5 6 % 6 % Operating income margin 29 % 28 % 27 % Key indicator: Consumer to consumer transactions 225.8 213.7 196.1 6 % 9 % The table below sets forth transaction and revenue growth rates by region for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Consumer to consumer transaction growth (a): EMEASA 4 % 5 % Americas 6 % 11 % APAC 9 % 14 % Consumer to consumer revenue growth (a): EMEASA 4 % 0 % Americas 5 % 2 % APAC 11 % 13 % (a) In determining the revenue and transaction growth rates under the regional view in the above table, the geographic split is determined based upon the region where the money transfer is initiated and the region where the money transfer is paid. For transactions originated and paid in different regions, we split the transaction count and revenue between the two regions, with each region receiving 50%. For money transfers initiated and paid in the same region, 100% of the revenue and transactions are attributed to that region. When referring to revenue and transaction growth rates for individual countries in the following discussion, all transactions to, from and within those countries, and 100% of the revenue associated with each transaction to, from and within those countries are included. The countries of India and China combined represented approximately 8%, 7% and 7% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, represented more than approximately 6% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 58 Table of Contents Transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues 2011 compared to 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, consumer to consumer money transfer revenue grew 5%, on transaction growth of 6%. The weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies positively impacted our revenue growth by approximately 1%, which was offset by slight price reductions for the year ended December 31, 2011. Revenue in our EMEASA region increased 4% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to transaction growth of 4% as well as the other factors described above. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Gulf States continued to experience revenue and transaction growth for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the prior year, which was partially offset by softness in Southern Europe and Russia and declines resulting from the political unrest in Libya and the Ivory Coast. Our money transfer business to India experienced revenue growth of 11% and transaction growth of 10% for the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the prior year. Americas revenue increased 5% due to transaction growth of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Our domestic business experienced revenue growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to transaction growth of 16%. Transaction growth in our domestic business was higher than revenue growth due to transaction growth being greater in lower principal bands, which have lower revenue per transaction. Our United States outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2011. Mexico revenue increased 2% on flat transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our Mexico business is being affected by on going changes to our compliance procedures related to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. These changes are expected to cause our Mexico business to decline in 2012. Revenue in our Asia Pacific (APAC) region increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to transaction growth of 9% and the weakening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which positively impacted revenue. Chinas revenue increased 6% for year ended December 31, 2011 on transaction growth of 4% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 grew compared to the same period in 2010, driven primarily by increased amounts of cross border principal sent. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a benefit to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $39.1 million over the same period in 2010, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest benefit was related to the EMEASA region. We have historically implemented and will likely implement future strategic fee reductions and actions to adjust foreign exchange spreads, where appropriate, taking into account a variety of factors. Fee and foreign exchange reductions generally reduce revenues in the near term, but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time. In certain corridors, we may also implement fee or foreign exchange spread increases. In 2011, we adjusted our reporting of the net impact of price reductions. We now calculate the impact of price reductions against prior year transaction volumes, rather than current year transaction volumes. We believe utilizing prior year transaction volumes more appropriately differentiates between the impacts of price reductions versus other items impacting revenue. Under the new methodology, the fee decreases and foreign exchange actions were approximately 1% of total Western Union revenue for the full year 2011 compared to approximately 3% for the full year 2010, as fee reductions were slightly lower and there is some offset by modest increases in foreign currency spreads in some corridors. Under the previous methodology, we reported that the impact of price reductions in 2010 was 4%. 59 Table of Contents The majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations; new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to growth in the first few years of their operation. Increased productivity, measured by transactions per location, is often experienced as locations mature. We believe that new agent locations will help our growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money. We generally refer to locations with more than 50% of transactions being initiated (versus paid) as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations. Send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue. They contribute more transactions per location than receive locations. However, a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution and convenience for consumers. The number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location, migration patterns, the locations class of trade, hours of operation, length of time the location has been offering our services, regulatory limitations and competition. Each of the more than 485,000 agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services; however, not every location completes a transaction in a given period. For example, as of December 31, 2011, more than 85% of agent locations in the United States, Canada and Western Europe (representing at least one of our three money transfer brands: Western Union&reg;, Orlandi Valuta(SM) and Vigo&reg;) experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. In the developing regions of Asia and other areas where there are primarily receive locations, approximately 65% of locations experienced money transfer activity in the previous 12 months. We periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions. 2010 compared to 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year, consumer to consumer money transfer revenue grew 2% primarily due to transaction growth of 9%. Transaction growth was offset by price decreases, primarily related to pricing reductions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009, geographic and product mix, including a higher percentage of revenue earned from intra country activity, and the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies, which negatively impacted revenue by approximately 1%. Our international consumer to consumer business experienced revenue growth of 3% on transaction growth of 8% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our international business represents all transactions other than transactions between and within the United States and Canada and transactions to and from Mexico. Our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States also experienced revenue growth on transaction increases for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenue in our EMEASA region remained flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year despite transaction growth of 5%. Transaction growth was offset by the strengthening of the United States dollar compared to most other foreign currencies in the region and many of the same factors described above. Our European market experienced transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year. In addition, for the full year ended December 31, 2010, revenue and transactions in the Gulf States declined moderately compared to the same period in 2009, however, both revenue and transactions grew in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the comparable period in the prior year. India had transaction growth of 4% and revenue growth of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 versus the same period in 2009. Americas revenue increased 2% on transaction growth of 11% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to the pricing actions taken in the domestic business commencing in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our domestic business experienced revenue declines of 6% on transaction growth of 28% for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the same factors. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, our domestic business experienced revenue growth of 7% on transaction growth of 29% as we reached the anniversary of the pricing reductions taken in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our United States outbound business experienced both transaction and revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Mexico business revenue was flat during the year ended December 31, 2010 on transaction growth of 2%. 60 Table of Contents APAC revenue increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the prior year due to transaction growth of 14%. Chinas revenue increased 10% on transaction growth of 7% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 grew compared to the prior year, driven primarily by revenue from our international consumer to consumer business outside of the United States. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and currencies other than the United States dollar have resulted in a reduction to transaction fees and foreign exchange revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $32.3 million over the same period in the previous year, net of foreign currency hedges, that would not have occurred had there been constant currency rates. The largest impact was related to the EMEASA region. Operating income 2011 compared to 2010 Consumer to consumer operating income increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to revenue growth. The change in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was primarily due to restructuring savings and revenue leverage, partially offset by negative currency impacts, including the effect of foreign currency hedges, and spending on initiatives. 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer to consumer operating income increased 6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies, primarily decreased bad debt expense, offset by higher employee compensation costs and incremental costs associated with our retail expansion in Europe pursuant to the Payment Services Directive. The increase in operating income margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from these same factors. Global Business Payments Segment The following table sets forth our global business payments segment results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (dollars and transactions in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues: Transaction fees $ 587.8 $ 578.0 $ 621.9 2% (7)% Foreign exchange revenues 168.1 113.0 33.2 49% * Other revenues 28.8 30.7 36.6 (6)% (16)% Total revenues $ 784.7 $ 721.7 $ 691.7 9% 4% Operating income $ 140.4 $ 122.5 $ 171.9 15% (29)% Operating income margin 18% 17% 25% Key indicator: Global business payments transactions 425.0 404.9 414.8 5% (2)% * Calculation not meaningful 61 Table of Contents Revenues 2011 compared to 2010 During the year ended December 31, 2011, global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of TGBP, which contributed $35.2 million of revenue, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and revenue growth in international bill payments, Business Solutions, and United States electronic bill payments, partially offset by a decline in United States cash based bill payments. Transaction growth during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 was due to growth in our international bill payments and United States electronic bill payments businesses. 2010 compared to 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2010, global business payments segment revenue was positively impacted by our acquisition of Custom House, which contributed $111.0 million of revenue in 2010 versus $30.8 million in 2009, primarily included in foreign exchange revenues, and growth in the Pago F&aacute;cil business. These increases were offset by revenue declines in our United States cash based bill payments businesses as many United States consumers who would use our services continued to have difficulty paying their bills and continue to be unable to obtain credit in any form, resulting in us handling fewer bill payments. The ongoing trend away from cash based bill payments in the United States and competitive pressures, which resulted in lower cash and electronic volumes and a shift to lower revenue per transaction products, also contributed to the revenue declines. The transaction declines during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 were due to declines in our United States bill payments businesses. Operating income 2011 compared to 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2011, operating income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue increases, a decrease in integration expenses related to the acquisition of Custom House, decreased debit card bank fees due to the recent Durbin legislation, and restructuring savings, partially offset by declines in our United States cash based bill payments business, which has a higher margin than other payment services in the segment, and integration and amortization expenses related to the acquisition of TGBP. The changes in operating income margins in the segment are due to the same factors mentioned above. 2010 compared to 2009 For the year ended December 31, 2010, operating income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to declines related to the United States cash based bill payments business, and investing and operating costs, including amortization expense, associated with the acquisition of Custom House. The decline in operating income margin in the segment is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the acquisition of Custom House and declines in our United States cash based bill payments business. 62 Table of Contents Other The following table sets forth other results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Years Ended December 31, % Change 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 (dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 98.3 $ 87.6 $ 91.2 12 % (4 )% Operating (loss)/income $ (24.6 ) $ (6.2 ) $ 6.3 * * * Calculation not meaningful Revenues 2011 compared to 2010 Revenue grew for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to volume increases in our prepaid business. 2010 compared to 2009 Revenue, generated primarily from our money order services business, declined for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year. We experienced a decrease in the amount of revenue earned related to our money order services business as we no longer receive a fixed return of 5.5% from IPS on outstanding money order balances as we did for the first three quarters of 2009. We now derive investment income from interest generated on our money order settlement assets, which are primarily held in United States tax exempt state and municipal debt securities. These securities generally have a lower rate of return than we were receiving under our previous agreement with IPS. Operating (loss)/income 2011 compared to 2010 During the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in operating loss was primarily due to deal costs associated with the TGBP acquisition. 2010 compared to 2009 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the decrease in operating income was due to the decrease in revenue from our money order services business, as described above, and an increase in promotional marketing activities related to our prepaid business in the United States. In 2009, we also incurred additional costs associated with evaluating and closing acquisitions compared to 2010. Further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue, operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 63 Table of Contents 2012 Changes in Reportable Segments In connection with the acquisition of TGBP, recent management changes, and other key strategic initiatives, we will implement a new segment structure to assess performance and allocate resources, beginning in the first quarter of 2012. The changes in our segment structure primarily relate to the separation of the Global Business Payments segment into two new reportable segments, Consumer to Business and Business Solutions. A summary of how the segments will be structured follows: Segment Description Consumer to Consumer Money transfer services between consumers, primarily through a global network of third party agents. Consumer to Business Processing of payments from consumers to businesses and other organizations, including utilities, auto finance companies, mortgage servicers, financial service providers, government agencies and other businesses. Business Solutions Business to business payment solutions, primarily for cross border, cross currency transactions, including services provided under our existing Western Union Business Solutions business and TGBP, which was acquired in November 2011. Other Businesses that have not been classified into one of our other segments. These businesses primarily include our money order and prepaid services businesses. Capital Resources and Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities, primarily from net income and fluctuations in working capital. Our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings, timing of income tax payments, including our tax deposit described further in Cash Flows from Operating Activities, and collections on receivables, among other items. The majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarters which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarters. Our future cash flows could be impacted by a variety of factors, some of which are out of our control, including changes in economic conditions, especially those impacting the migrant population and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits, including the resolution of outstanding tax matters. A significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries, some of which are regulated entities. These subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash to the parent company for general corporate use except for assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions. Assets subject to legal or regulatory restrictions, totaling approximately $230 million as of December 31, 2011, include assets outside of the United States subject to restrictions from being transferred outside of the countries where they are located. We are also required to maintain cash and investment balances in our regulated subsidiaries related to certain of our money transfer and other payment obligations. Significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our business needs, including approximately $190 million of tax payments we expect to make in 2012 as a result of the IRS Agreement, dividends and share repurchases, through our existing cash balances and our ability to generate cash flows through operations. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.65 billion revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) and had $297.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which left $1,353.0 million remaining that was available to borrow on the Revolving Credit Facility. 64 Table of Contents Cash and Investment Securities As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion, of which $476 million was held by our foreign entities. Our ongoing cash management strategies to fund our business needs could cause United States and foreign cash balances to fluctuate. Repatriating foreign funds to the United States would, in many cases, result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the United States. We expect to use foreign funds to expand and fund our international operations and to acquire businesses internationally. In many cases, we receive funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle the payment of those transactions. These funds, referred to as Settlement assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are not used to support our operations. However, we earn income from investing these funds. We maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments, classified as Cash and cash equivalents within Settlement assets, to fund settlement obligations. Investment securities, classified within Settlement assets, were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. Substantially all of these investments are highly rated state and municipal debt securities. Most state regulators in the United States require us to maintain specific highly rated, investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk. We regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by investing in highly rated securities and diversifying our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, the majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. Our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration. As of December 31, 2011, all investments with a single issuer and each individual security was less than 10% of our investment securities portfolio. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $1,174.9 million, $994.4 million and $1,218.1 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 2010, we made a $250.0 million tax deposit relating to United States federal tax liabilities, including those arising from our 2003 international restructuring, which have been previously accrued in our consolidated financial statements. Making the deposit limits the further accrual of interest charges with respect to such tax liabilities, to the extent of the deposit. 65 Table of Contents Financing Resources As of December 31, 2011, we had the following outstanding borrowings (in millions): Due in less than one year: Commercial paper $ 297.0 Due in greater than one year (a): Floating rate notes due 2013 (b) 300.0 6.500% notes (effective rate of 5.5%) due 2014 500.0 5.930% notes due 2016 (c) 1,000.0 3.650% notes (effective rate of 4.4%) due 2018 (d) 400.0 5.253% notes due 2020 (c) 324.9 6.200% notes due 2036 (c) 500.0 6.200% notes due 2040 (c) 250.0 Other borrowings 8.8 Total borrowings at par value 3,580.7 Fair value hedge accounting adjustments, net (a) 23.9 Unamortized discount, net (21.4 ) Total borrowings at carrying value (e) $ 3,583.2 (a) We utilize interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to effectively change the interest rate payments on a portion of our notes from fixed rate payments to short term LIBOR based variable rate payments in order to manage our overall exposure to interest rates. The changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps result in an offsetting hedge accounting adjustment recorded to the carrying value of the related note. These hedge accounting adjustments will be reclassified as reductions to or increases in Interest expense over the life of the related notes and cause the effective rate of interest to differ from the notes stated rate. (b) On March 7, 2011, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due March 7, 2013 (2013 Notes). Interest is payable quarterly at a per annum interest rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (1.11% as of December 31, 2011) and is reset quarterly. See below for additional detail relating to the debt issuance. (c) The difference between the stated interest rate and the effective interest rate is not significant. (d) On August 22, 2011, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 3.650% unsecured fixed rate notes due 2018 (2018 Notes). In anticipation of this issuance, we entered into interest rate lock contracts to fix the interest rate of the debt issuance, and recorded a loss on the contracts of $21.6 million, which increased the effective rate to 4.4%, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into Interest expense over the life of the 2018 Notes. See below for additional detail relating to the debt issuance. (e) As of December 31, 2011, our weighted average effective rate on total borrowings was approximately 4.8%. Commercial Paper Program Pursuant to our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes in an amount not to exceed $1.5 billion outstanding at any time, reduced to the extent of borrowings outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Our commercial paper borrowings may have maturities of up to 397 days from date of issuance. 66 Table of Contents Interest rates for borrowings are based on market rates at the time of issuance. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2011 had a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately 0.6% and a weighted average term of 9 days. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $89.7 million and the maximum balance outstanding was $784.1 million. Proceeds from our commercial paper borrowings were used for general liquidity. We had $297.0 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Revolving Credit Facility On September 23, 2011, we entered into a credit agreement which expires January 2017 providing for unsecured financing facilities in an aggregate amount of $1.65 billion, including a $250.0 million letter of credit sub facility and a $150.0 million swing line sub facility. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that was set to expire in September 2012. Interest due under the Revolving Credit Facility is fixed for the term of each borrowing and is payable according to the terms of that borrowing. Generally, interest is calculated using a selected LIBOR rate plus an interest rate margin of 90 basis points. A facility fee of 10 basis points is also payable quarterly on the total facility, regardless of usage. Both the interest rate margin and facility fee percentage are based on certain of our credit ratings. The purpose of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is diversified through a group of 17 participating institutions, is to provide general liquidity and to support our commercial paper program, which we believe enhances our short term credit rating. The largest commitment from any single financial institution within the total committed balance of $1.65 billion is approximately 12%. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $1.65 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had $297.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, which left $1,353.0 million remaining that was available to borrow on the Revolving Credit Facility. If the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility decreased, or if the Revolving Credit Facility were eliminated, the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted. Notes On August 22, 2011, we issued $400.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due August 22, 2018 for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt. Interest with respect to the 2018 Notes is payable semi annually in arrears on February 22 and August 22 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 3.650%. We may redeem the 2018 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 35 basis points. On March 7, 2011, we issued $300.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured floating rate notes due March 7, 2013 for general corporate purposes. Interest with respect to the 2013 Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on each March 7, June 7, September 7 and December 7, beginning June 7, 2011, at a per annum interest rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 58 basis points (reset quarterly). On June 21, 2010, we issued $250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due June 21, 2040 (2040 Notes). Interest with respect to the 2040 Notes is payable semi annually on June 21 and December 21 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2040 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 30 basis points. On March 30, 2010, we exchanged $303.7 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2011 (2011 Notes) for unsecured notes due April 1, 2020 (2020 Notes). Interest with respect to the 2020 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum 67 Table of Contents interest rate of 5.253%. In connection with the exchange, note holders were given a 7% premium ($21.2 million), which approximated market value at the exchange date, as additional principal. As this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, this premium was not charged to expense. Rather, the premium, along with the offsetting hedge accounting adjustments, will be accreted into Interest expense over the life of the notes. We may redeem the 2020 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 15 basis points. On February 26, 2009, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due February 26, 2014 (2014 Notes). Interest with respect to the 2014 Notes is payable semi annually on February 26 and August 26 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.500%. We may redeem the 2014 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. On November 17, 2006, we issued $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due November 17, 2036 (2036 Notes). Interest with respect to the 2036 Notes is payable semi annually on May 17 and November 17 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 6.200%. We may redeem the 2036 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 25 basis points. On September 29, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on October 1, 2016 (2016 Notes). Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi annually on April 1 and October 1 each year based on the fixed per annum interest rate of 5.930%. We may redeem the 2016 Notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par or a price based on the applicable treasury rate plus 20 basis points. Credit Ratings and Debt Covenants The credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in our overall business, managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms. Factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings, cash flow generation, leverage, available liquidity and the overall business. Our Revolving Credit Facility contains an interest rate margin and facility fee which are determined based on certain of our credit ratings. In addition, we are subject to certain provisions in our 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2040 Notes and certain of our derivative contracts which could require settlement or collateral posting in the event of a change in control combined with a downgrade below investment grade. We do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings. The table below summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011: S&P Moodys Fitch Short term rating A 2 P 2 F2 Senior unsecured A A3 A Ratings outlook Stable Negative Stable These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade or a negative outlook provided by the rating agencies could result in the following: Our access to the commercial paper market may be limited, and if we were downgraded below investment grade, our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated; 68 Table of Contents We may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings; Our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease; Regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends; and Our business relationships may be adversely impacted. Consistent with the prior facility, the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict our ability to sell or transfer assets or enter into a merger or consolidate with another company, grant certain types of security interests, incur certain types of liens, impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. Our notes are subject to similar covenants except that only the 2016 Notes, 2020 Notes and the 2036 Notes contain covenants limiting or restricting subsidiary indebtedness and none of our notes are subject to a covenant that limits our ability to impose restrictions on subsidiary dividends. Also consistent with the prior facility, the Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a consolidated adjusted EBITDA interest coverage ratio of greater than 2:1 (ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income plus the sum of (a) interest expense, (b) income tax expense, (c) depreciation expense, (d) amortization expense, (e) any other non cash deductions, losses or changes made in determining net income for such period and (f) extraordinary losses or charges, minus extraordinary gains, in each case determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for such period, to interest expense) for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 9:1 for the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. A violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due, thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes. Cash Priorities Liquidity Our objective is to maintain strong liquidity and a capital structure consistent with our current credit ratings. We have existing cash balances, cash flows from operating activities, access to the commercial paper markets and our Revolving Credit Facility available to support the needs of our business. Capital Expenditures The total aggregate amount paid for contract costs, purchases of property and equipment and purchased and developed software was $162.5 million, $113.7 million and $98.9 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amounts paid for new and renewed agent contracts vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of new and renewed contract signings. Other capital expenditures during 2011, 2010 and 2009 included investments in our information technology infrastructure and purchased and developed software. Acquisition of Businesses On November 7, 2011, we acquired TGBP from Travelex Holdings Limited for cash consideration of &pound;603 million ($967.8 million), which included acquired cash of $40.0 million and an initial working capital adjustment. The final consideration is subject to an additional working capital adjustment. On October 31, 2011, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in Finint, one of our largest money transfer agents in Europe, for cash consideration of 99.6 million ($139.4 million). We previously held a 30% equity interest in Finint. 69 Table of Contents On April 20, 2011, we acquired the remaining 70% interest in Costa, one of our largest money transfer agents in Europe, for cash consideration of 95 million ($135.7 million), which included a reduction of 5 million ($7.1 million) for an initial working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement. The final consideration is subject to an additional working capital adjustment. We previously held a 30% equity interest in Costa. On September 1, 2009, we acquired Canada based Custom House, a provider of international business to business payment services, for cash consideration of $371.0 million for all of the common shares of this business and acquired cash of $2.5 million. On February 24, 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of European based FEXCO Group Holdings (FEXCO Group), one of our largest agents providing services in a number of European countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden and Ireland. We surrendered our 24.65% interest in FEXCO Group and paid 123.1 million ($157.4 million) as consideration for all of the common shares of the money transfer business and acquired cash of $11.8 million. Share Repurchases and Dividends During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, 40.3 million, 35.6 million and 24.8 million, respectively, of shares were repurchased for $800.0 million, $584.5 million and $400.0 million, respectively, excluding commissions, at an average cost of $19.83, $16.44 and $16.10 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, $615.5 million remains available under share repurchase authorizations approved by our Board of Directors through December 31, 2012. On February 7, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on March 30, 2012. During 2011, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share in each of the last three quarters and $0.07 per common share in the first quarter representing $194.2 million in total dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per common share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per common share in each of the first three quarters representing $165.3 million in total dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share representing $41.2 million in total dividends. These amounts were paid to shareholders of record in the respective month the dividend was declared, except for the September 2011 and 2010 declared dividends, which were paid in October 2011 and 2010, respectively. Debt Service Requirements Our 2012 debt service requirements will include payments on existing borrowings and any future borrowings under our commercial paper program and interest payments on all outstanding indebtedness. We have the ability to use existing financing sources, including our Revolving Credit Facility or commercial paper program, and cash generated from operations to meet our debt obligations as they come due. Our ability to continue to grow the business, make acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, and service our debt will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries, our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify acquisitions that align with our long term strategy. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 70 Table of Contents Pension Plan Our defined benefit pension plan had recorded unfunded pension obligations of $112.7 million and $112.8 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions of approximately $25 million to the Plan, including discretionary contributions of $3 million and $10 million, respectively. Due to the closure of one of our facilities in Missouri and an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, we funded $4.1 million during 2009. We will be required to fund approximately $20 million to the Plan in 2012 and may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $5 million. Our most recent measurement date for our pension plan was December 31, 2011. The calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions: 1) expected long term return on plan assets; and 2) discount rate. We employ a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long term historical risk, return, and co variance relationships between equities, fixed income securities, and alternative investments are considered consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined. Consideration is given to diversification, re balancing and yields anticipated on fixed income securities held. Historical returns are reviewed within the context of current economic conditions to check for reasonableness and appropriateness. We then apply this rate against a calculated value for our plan assets. The calculated value recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. Our expected long term return on plan assets was 7.00% for 2011 and 6.50% for 2010. The expected long term return on plan assets is 7.00% for 2012. As of December 31, 2011, pension plan target allocations were approximately 15% in equity investments, 60% in debt securities and 25% in alternative investment strategies (e.g. hedge funds, royalty rights and private equity funds). Hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to: commodities/currencies, equity long short, relative value, multi strategy, event driven, and global macro. The Plan holds derivative contracts directly which consist of standardized obligations to buy or sell United States treasury bonds or notes at predetermined future dates and prices which are transacted on regulated exchanges. Additionally, derivatives are held indirectly through funds in which the Plan is invested. Derivatives are used by the Plan to help reduce the Plans exposure to interest rate volatility and to provide an additional source of return. Cash held by the Plan is used to satisfy margin requirements on the derivatives. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset and liability studies. The discount rate assumption is set based on the rate at which the pension benefits could be settled effectively. The discount rate is determined by matching the timing and amount of anticipated payouts under the Plan to the rates from an AA spot rate yield curve. The curve is derived from AA bonds of varying maturities. The discount rate assumption for our benefit obligation was 3.72% and 4.69% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 100 basis point change to both the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact to our annual pension expense. 71 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Items related to amounts included on our balance sheet: Borrowings, including interest (a) $ 5,388.1 $ 474.5 $ 1,113.6 $ 1,260.3 $ 2,539.7 IRS Agreement (b) 190.0 190.0 Estimated pension funding (c) 84.7 20.2 43.2 21.3 Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 144.4 Foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts (e) 86.6 86.4 0.2 Other (f) 30.2 22.0 6.8 1.4 Other Contractual Obligations: Purchase obligations (g) 41.7 22.7 16.7 2.3 Operating leases 142.7 38.8 53.0 31.8 19.1 Other (h) 23.7 16.7 7.0 $ 6,132.1 $ 871.3 $ 1,240.5 $ 1,317.1 $ 2,558.8 (a) We have estimated our interest payments based on (i) commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and the assumption that these commercial paper borrowings will be repaid upon maturity and that no new issuances will occur in 2012, (ii) the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our notes, and (iii) an estimate of future interest rates on our floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements based on projected LIBOR rates. (b) In December 2011, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all of the issues related to the restructuring of our international operations in 2003. As a result of the IRS Agreement, we expect to make cash payments to the IRS and various state tax authorities in 2012 totaling approximately $190 million to cover the remaining portion of the additional tax and interest. (c) We have estimated our pension plan funding requirements, including interest, using assumptions that are consistent with current pension funding rates. The unfunded pension liability included in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the present value of the estimated pension plan funding requirements disclosed above. The actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution of up to approximately $5 million to the plan in 2012, which has not been reflected in the table above. (d) Unrecognized tax benefits include associated interest and penalties. The timing of related cash payments for substantially all of these liabilities is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control. (e) Represents the liability position of our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011, which will fluctuate based on market conditions. (f) This line item relates to accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of December 31, 2011. (g) Many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice and with a terminations penalty. Termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation. 72 Table of Contents Obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are, therefore, estimated in the above amounts. Historically, we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations. (h) This line item includes certain additional investments in our compliance programs along the United States and Mexico border, which are expected to cost up to $19 million over the next two years pursuant to the agreement and settlement with the State of Arizona and other states. This line item also includes the pending acquisition of the French assets of TGBP. Due to pending regulatory matters, this acquisition for cash consideration of &pound;3 million (approximately $4.7 million based on currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011) has not been finalized as of December 31, 2011. This acquisition is expected to close in 2012, subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of closing conditions. Other Commercial Commitments We had approximately $120 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees as of December 31, 2011, with expiration dates through 2015, the majority of which contain a one year renewal option. The letters of credit and bank guarantees are primarily held in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements. We expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to expiration in most circumstances. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 73 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies and estimates, described below, are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments. We believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates is essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Income Taxes Reinvestment of foreign earnings Income taxes, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations. We provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the required analyses and judgments. With respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, we have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined United States federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the United States indefinitely. No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes on certain of our outside tax basis differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of approximately $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2011, which we expect to reinvest outside the United States indefinitely. Upon distribution of these earnings to the United States in the form of actual or constructive dividends, we would be subject to United States income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits), state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the period such distribution occurred. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 74 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Income tax contingencies We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We have established contingency reserves for a variety of material, known tax exposures. Our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve. With respect to these reserves, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Pursuant to the tax allocation agreement signed in connection with the Spin off from First Data, we believe we have appropriately apportioned the taxes between First Data and us. Our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2011 were $135.0 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related benefits. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are required to indemnify First Data for taxes incurred as a result of the Spin off being taxable to First Data, it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 75 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Derivative Financial Instruments We utilize derivatives to (a) minimize our exposure related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and (b) facilitate cross currency business to business payments by writing derivatives to customers. We recognize all derivatives in Other assets and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value. Certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception, and others are not designated as accounting hedges. Cash Flow hedges Cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted revenues, as well as, from time to time, hedges of the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt. Derivative fair value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings, to the extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item. The portions of the change in fair value that are either considered ineffective or are excluded from the measure of effectiveness are recognized immediately in Derivative gains/(losses), net. Fair Value hedges Fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt, through interest rate swaps. The changes in fair value of these hedges, along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense. The accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements. The details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risks being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness, if any, will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item, and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis. If the hedge is no longer deemed effective, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. While we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported results. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative pre tax unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss from such cash flow hedges that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was $3.9 million. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative debt adjustments from our fair value hedges that would be reflected in earnings if such hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting was a $23.9 million gain. 76 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Other Intangible Assets We capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as well as acquired intangible assets and software. We evaluate such intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets may be compared with their carrying values to determine if a write down to fair value (normally measured by the present value technique) is required. The capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given agent contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract. The estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with each asset requires us to make estimates and assumptions including among other things revenue growth rates, and operating margins based on our budgets and business plans. Disruptions to contractual relationships, significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with contracts, or other issues significantly impacting the future cash flows associated with the contract would cause us to evaluate the recoverability of the asset. If an event described above occurs and causes us to determine that an asset has been impaired, that could result in an impairment charge. The net carrying value of our other intangible assets as of December 31, 2011 was $847.4 million. 77 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Goodwill Impairment Testing An impairment assessment of goodwill is conducted annually at the reporting unit level. This assessment of goodwill is performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. Reporting units are driven by the level at which management reviews segment operating results. In some cases, that level is the operating segment (e.g., consumer to consumer money transfer) and in others it is one level below the operating segment (e.g., Business Solutions, which is included in our global business payments segment). Our impairment assessment begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The initial qualitative assessment includes comparing the overall financial performance of the reporting units against the planned results. Additionally, each reporting units fair value is assessed under certain events and circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and other relevant entity specific events. If it is determined in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the standard two step quantitative impairment test is performed. First, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated or determined using discounted cash flows and is compared to its carrying value. If the first step indicates the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the second step is required. The second step is to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill by allocating the determined fair value to all the reporting units assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The remaining fair value of the reporting unit, if any, is deemed to be the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill above its implied fair value. The determination of the reporting units and which reporting units to include in the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment. Also, all of the assumptions used in the qualitative assessment require judgment. For the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of reporting units through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including, among other items, revenue growth rates, operating margins, and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected regulatory, marketplace, and other economic factors. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events. In addition, as our business or the way we manage our business changes, our reporting units may also change. If an event described above occurs and causes us to recognize a goodwill impairment charge, it would impact our reported earnings in the periods such charge occurs. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2011 was $3,198.9 million which represented approximately 35% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2011, goodwill of $1,945.3 million and $1,014.7 million resides in our consumer to consumer and Business Solutions reporting units, respectively. For the consumer to consumer reporting unit, the fair value of the business greatly exceeds its carrying amount. TGBP was recently purchased and represents a significant majority of the goodwill related to the Business Solutions reporting unit. A fair value decline could occur if actual and forecasted cash flows do not meet expectations. Such a decline would likely result in an impairment, which could be significant. We have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended December 31, 2011. 78 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Acquisitions Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets less liabilities and noncontrolling interests is recorded as goodwill. For most acquisitions, we engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as agent networks, customer relationships, tradenames and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of one year or less as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Purchase price allocation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities primarily using discounted cash flows and replacement cost analysis. During the last three years, we completed the following acquisitions: In November 2011, we acquired TGBP for $967.8 million. In October 2011, we acquired Finint for total value of $187.2 million. In April 2011, we acquired Costa for total value of $181.9 million. In September 2009, we acquired Custom House for $371.0 million. In February 2009, we acquired the money transfer business of FEXCO Group for $243.6 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions, to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, for more information related to the purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed during the last three years. If estimates or assumptions used to complete the initial purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made in the final valuation, the allocation of purchase price between goodwill and intangibles could significantly differ. Such a difference would impact future earnings through amortization expense of these intangibles. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments could arise, as discussed further in Goodwill Impairment Testing and Other Intangible Assets above. For all of our acquisitions during the three years ended December 31, 2011, goodwill of $1,509.0 million and intangibles of $608.9 million were recognized. 79 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ fromAssumptions Restructuring and Related Expenses We have engaged in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. We also evaluate impairment issues associated with restructuring activities. Restructuring and related expenses consist of direct and incremental costs associated with restructuring and related activities, including severance, outplacement and other employee related benefits; facility closure and migration of our IT infrastructure; and other expenses related to the relocation of various operations to new or existing Company facilities and third party providers, including hiring, training, relocation, travel, and professional fees. Also included in the facility closure expenses are non cash expenses related to fixed asset and leasehold improvement write offs and accelerated depreciation at impacted facilities. These costs represent managements best estimate, until all such amounts are paid and settled. As such, these costs require assumptions about the activities that may change over time. The decision to include a cost in the restructuring disclosure requires an assessment of whether the cost is direct and incremental to the productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures. This assessment can require judgment depending on the nature of the cost. The timing of recording these costs was determined by the applicable accounting guidance. This judgment significantly impacted the timing of the recognition of restructuring and related expenses on a quarterly basis and between the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. The restructuring and related expenses are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring and related expenses could be materially impacted. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we incurred $46.8 million and $59.5 million of restructuring and related expenses, respectively. $13.9 million of these expenses remained unpaid as of December 31, 2011. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and credit risk related to our agents and customers. A risk management program is in place to manage these risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We provide consumer to consumer money transfer services in more than 200 countries and territories. We manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process. We settle with the vast majority of our agents in United States dollars or euros. However, in certain circumstances, we settle in other currencies. We typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients; thus, we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies. The foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within 24 hours after they are initiated. To mitigate this risk further, we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities from a few days up to one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts, typically with terms of less than one year at inception, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions and intercompany loans. In certain consumer money transfer and global business payments transactions involving different send and receive currencies, we generate revenue based on the 80 Table of Contents difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency, helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations. We promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies. We use longer term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consumer to consumer revenues denominated primarily in the euro, and to a lesser degree the British pound, Canadian dollar and other currencies. We use contracts with maturities of up to 36 months at inception to mitigate some of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on forecasted revenues, with a targeted weighted average maturity of approximately one year. We believe the use of longer term foreign currency forward contracts provides predictability of future cash flows from our international consumer to consumer operations. We have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management due to the nature of our Western Union Business Solutions (Business Solutions) business, which includes our Travelex Global Business Payments business (TGBP), which was acquired in November 2011. The significant majority of this business revenue is from exchanges of currency at the spot rate enabling customers to make cross currency payments. In certain countries, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments. The duration of these derivatives contracts is generally nine months or less. Business Solutions aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. The foreign exchange risk is actively managed. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, a hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the United States dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated would have resulted in a decrease/increase to pre tax annual income of approximately $33 million and $32 million, respectively, based on our forecast of consumer to consumer unhedged exposure to foreign currency at those dates. There are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis, primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous, that the unhedged exposure is static, and that we would not hedge any additional exposure. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise, which may positively or negatively affect income. Interest Rates We invest in several types of interest bearing assets, with a total value as of December 31, 2011 of $2.7 billion. Approximately $1.8 billion of these assets bear interest at floating rates and are therefore sensitive to changes in interest rates. These assets primarily include money market funds and state and municipal variable rate securities and are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Cash and cash equivalents and Settlement assets. To the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption, they are classified as Settlement assets. Earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Substantially all of the remainder of our interest bearing assets consist of highly rated state and municipal debt securities, the majority of which are fixed rate instruments. These investments may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment services awaiting redemption classified within Settlement assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As interest rates rise, the fair value of these fixed rate interest bearing securities will decrease; conversely, a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair values of the securities. We have classified these investments as available for sale within Settlement assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, recorded these instruments at their fair value with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of the applicable deferred income tax effect, being added to or deducted from our Total stockholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 81 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we had $300.0 million of floating notes, which had an effective interest rate of 1.11% or 58 basis points above three month LIBOR. Additionally, $500.0 million of our total $3.6 billion of fixed rate borrowings at par value are effectively floating rate debt through interest rate swap agreements, changing this fixed rate debt to LIBOR based floating rate debt, with weighted average spreads of approximately 600 basis points above LIBOR. Borrowings under our commercial paper program mature in such a short period that the financing is effectively floating rate. Commercial paper borrowings of $297.0 million were outstanding as of the year ended December 31, 2011. Our commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2011 had a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately 0.6% and a weighted average term of 9 days. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the average commercial paper balance outstanding was $89.7 million and the maximum balance outstanding was $784.1 million. We review our overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset or liability position in each, also considering the duration of the individual positions. We manage this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk, reduce costs and improve returns. Our exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt. The latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances (i.e., fixed versus floating). We use interest rate swaps designated as hedges to increase the percentage of floating rate debt, subject to market conditions. As of December 31, 2011, our weighted average effective rate was approximately 4.8%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease/increase to pre tax income of approximately $11 million and $12 million annually based on borrowings on December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The same 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates, if applied to our cash and investment balances on December 31, 2011 and 2010 that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, would result in an offsetting benefit/reduction to pre tax income of approximately $18 million and $25 million annually, respectively. There are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous. As a result, the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes, including changes in credit risk regarding our investments, which may positively or negatively affect income. In addition, the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time. We will also be further impacted by changes to future interest rates as we refinance our debt or by reinvesting proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Credit Risk Our interest earning assets include investment securities, substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt securities, which are classified in Settlement assets and accounted for as available for sale securities, and money market fund investments, which are classified in Cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our investment securities had credit ratings of AA or better from a major credit rating agency. To manage our exposures to credit risk with respect to investment securities, money market investments, derivatives and other credit risk exposures resulting from our relationships with banks and financial institutions, we regularly review investment concentrations, trading levels, credit spreads and credit ratings, and we attempt to diversify our investments among global financial institutions. We also limit our investment level in any individual money market fund to no more than $100 million. We are also exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from agents in the money transfer, walk in bill payment and money order settlement process. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk directly from consumer transactions particularly through our Internet services and electronic channels, where transactions are originated through means other than cash, and therefore are subject to chargebacks, insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud. We perform a credit review before each agent signing and conduct periodic analyses. 82 Table of Contents We are exposed to credit risk in our Business Solutions business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) receivables from certain customers for which beneficiaries are paid prior to receiving cleared funds from the customer (known as early release). For the derivatives, the duration of these contracts is generally nine months or less. The credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. For early release customers, collection ordinarily occurs within a few days. To mitigate risk, we perform credit reviews of the customer on an ongoing basis, and, for our derivatives, we may require certain customers to post collateral or increase collateral based on the fair value of the customers contract and their risk profile. Our losses associated with bad debts have been less than 1% of our revenues in all periods presented. 83 Table of Contents
