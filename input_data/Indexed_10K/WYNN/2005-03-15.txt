Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we refinanced Wynn Las Vegas debt structure. In connection therewith, we discharged our obligations under the Second Mortgage Notes and the $28.1 million remaining in the interest reserve account established for the payment of interest on the Second Mortgage Notes was used, along with the proceeds of the offering of $1.3 billion of First Mortgage Notes and other funds, to repay or discharge outstanding debt. Accordingly, all of the Second Mortgage Notes proceeds have been fully utilized as of December 31, 2004. None of the proceeds of either the initial public offering of our common stock or the issuance of the Notes were paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors, officers, partners or affiliates or any of their associates, or any persons or entities owning 10% or more of our common stock other than the salaries, bonuses and directors fees associated with the normal performance of their duties in such respective capacity for the development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Valvino, a development stage company, was formed in April 2000 as a Nevada limited liability company originally to acquire land and design, develop and finance Wynn Las Vegas. On September 24, 2002, Wynn Resorts, a development stage company, became the parent company of Valvino when all the members of Valvino contributed 210,834 shares comprising 100% of the membership interests of Valvino to Wynn Resorts in exchange for 40,000,000 shares of the common stock of Wynn Resorts. The following reflects the selected consolidated financial data of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries or its predecessor Valvino and its subsidiaries.

You should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. Overview Since inception, we have been primarily a casino resort development company. Our efforts have been devoted principally to the development and construction activities described below with respect to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, our casino resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), respectively. Wynn Las Vegas will occupy approximately 197 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and will utilize an additional 18 acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In November 2004, we announced plans for Encore, which will occupy approximately 20 acres of land adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Macau will initially utilize approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A. from the government of Macau in Macaus inner harbor area. We began construction of Wynn Las Vegas in October 2002 and the project is nearing substantial completion. Wynn Las Vegas will have its grand opening on April 28, 2005. We are developing the budget plans and specifications for Encore. We commenced construction on Wynn Macau in June 2004, and in September 2004 obtained the financing necessary to fund its budgeted development, construction and preopening costs. We expect to open Wynn Macau in the third quarter of 2006. There are significant risks associated with any major construction project, and unexpected developments or delays could occur. Our consolidated financial statements also include results from the ownership and operation of our corporate aircraft and the operation of an art gallery, through May 6, 2004, displaying works from The Wynn Collection, which consists of works of fine art from the personal art collection of Stephen A. and Elaine P. Wynn. Through June 2002, we also operated the golf course located on the site of the former Desert Inn in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas The construction of Wynn Las Vegas is nearing substantial completion and remains within the project budget. The contractor has completed the majority of the work and is currently in the process of completing the exterior site work and interior finishes. In support of our pre opening efforts, we are currently occupying the following portions of Wynn Las Vegas under a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) issued by the Clark County Building Department: The Wynn Theater; Meeting and convention facilities; Warehouse and receiving; Engineering and shop areas; and A portion of the administrative offices. We have been accepting room reservations by telephone since January 2005 and on line since February 2005 (at www.wynnlasvegas.com). We also have been booking conventions for more than a year. 49 Wynn Las Vegas project budget, excluding the incremental cost for Encore, was, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.7 billion, including the cost of acquiring approximately 235 acres of land, costs of design and construction, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $2.0 billion of project costs for Wynn Las Vegas primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes), and a portion of our former credit facilities. We estimated that approximately $670.0 million would be needed as of that date to complete Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2004, we contributed $400.0 million to Wynn Las Vegas,LLC from the proceeds of the November 2004 offering of 7.5 million shares of our common stock. Also, on December 14, 2004, we effected a series of transactions to refinance Wynn Las Vegas debt and raise additional funds for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. These transactions included, among other things, issuance of $1.3 billion of 6.625% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes), a tender offer for all of the outstanding Second Mortgage Notes, discharge of the remaining Second Mortgage Notes, and replacement of our previous credit facilities with new credit facilities. The new credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% on the revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and LIBOR plus 2.125% on the term loan facility (the Term Loans). The refinancing lowered our overall cost of borrowing and provided the financial flexibility to allow for the further development of our real estate assets. The $400.0 million contribution from our common stock offering, a portion of the remaining proceeds of our First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities are expected to provide sufficient funds to complete and open Wynn Las Vegas. In addition, we have a $50.0 million completion guarantee balance and a $30.0 million liquidity reserve available for Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Resorts is not a guarantor of the new financing and is not obligated to apply any of its funds to the Wynn Las Vegas project, although it has more than $300.0 million in cash that can be made available. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas The Company continues to refine the scope and design of Encore. Previously, Encore was to include a hotel tower with approximately 1,500 mini suites, a small amount of ancillary gaming space, restaurants, a spa, swimming pools, additional retail and approximately 30,000 square feet of meeting rooms. It was expected to cost no more than $900 million and to open in the second half of 2007. As initially planned, Encore was an addition to Wynn Las Vegas. Due to anticipated demand for Wynn Las Vegas, continued strength in the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, the Company anticipates a significant increase in the scope of Encore, elevating it to the status of a free standing casino resort; one which is integrated with Wynn Las Vegas through its public space. Although the scope and design of the project have not been finalized and remain subject to board of director approval, we now expect that Encore will include approximately 2,000 full suites in its hotel tower meaning separate living rooms and bedrooms in each unit as well as significant additional casino, convention and meeting space, additional entertainment venues, restaurants, a spa and salon, swimming pools and retail space. We currently anticipate that Encore will open in the first half of 2008. We expect that the remaining proceeds from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs sale of first mortgage notes on December 14, 2004, together with availability under its existing credit facilities and cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.4 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. The availability of notes proceeds and funds under the credit agreement in excess of $100 million is subject to approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications by the majority of arrangers or lenders. Once we have finalized the scope and plans for Encore, we will seek necessary consents and approvals from our lenders and noteholders. 50 Wynn Macau We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first hotel and casino resort in Macau, under a 20 year concession agreement with the government of Macau granted in June 2002 to our indirect subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A. Although we continue to refine the design of the resort, including potential expansion and improvements, Wynn Macau is currently expected to occupy approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A., and include approximately 600 hotel rooms, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 28,000 square feet of retail space, and a spa, salon and entertainment facilities. In September 2004, we acquired all of the 17.5% indirect economic interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. that were formerly held by third parties in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of our common stock. Consequently, we now own 100% of the economic interest and control 90% of the voting interest of Wynn Macau, S.A. indirectly through various subsidiaries. Macau law requires that the position of executive director and at least 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A. be held by a resident of Macau. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, a Macau permanent resident who is the executive director of Wynn Macau, S.A., owns 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A., although he has only nominal (up to 1 Macau pataca) dividend participation rights. Design and construction of Wynn Macau is progressing on schedule and within budget. The resort is expected to open in the third quarter of 2006. Detailed interior design work is continuing, with the majority of architectural and structural design work now complete. Construction is progressing well with piling and other in ground activities substantially complete. Superstructure works are well underway with the hotel tower reaching the fourth floor level. Construction activities since groundbreaking include the following: Piling work is complete; Construction of basement plant and tunnel areas is substantially complete; The hotel tower structure has reached the fourth floor level; Structural floor slabs for the main casino area are approximately 90% complete; and Approximately 1,500 tons of structural steel has been erected in the main casino area and the second floor office area. Wynn Macaus project budget is approximately $704.0 million. This includes land acquisition costs of approximately $40.6 million, construction and design costs of approximately $425.0 million, plus capitalized interest, preopening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies, but excludes up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments that are anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $123.2 million of project costs and estimated that approximately $580.8 million would be required as of that date to complete Wynn Macau. These costs are being, and will continue to be, funded from the existing cash balances of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions, intercompany loans (including up to $122.0 million from Wynn Las Vegas, LLC as provided under its existing indebtedness) and or subordinated funding, as well as the available senior secured credit facility described more fully below. In September 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. obtained the financing necessary to carry out its development plans and maintain the financial capacity to adequately operate its gaming business in Macau. From a combination of capital contributions and intercompany loans bearing an annual interest rate of 6.25%, we have invested, or will invest, a total of approximately $230.0 million into the Wynn Macau project. In addition, we intend to make an additional subordinated intercompany loan for approximately $122.0 million at an interest rate of 7.5%. The remaining $352.0 million to fund the budgeted project costs will be provided in the form of a base term loan as part of a $397.0 million senior secured bank facility entered into by Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition to the base term loan and to cover any potential owner generated cost overruns, we have established a $30.0 million contingent equity funding source in the form of an intercompany loan and have available a $30.0 million 51 contingent debt facility. The senior secured bank facility also includes a working capital facility of $15.0 million. Agreements governing the senior bank facility specify the sequencing of funding sources. Prior to borrowing under the senior bank facility, we must first utilize the majority of the cash balances funded to the Wynn Macau project. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated by its casino concession agreement, and has obtained, a 700.0 million pataca (approximately $87.5 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) that is effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this required guarantee will be reduced to 300.0 million patacas (approximately $37.5 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. As part of the security for the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited with BNU, $50.0 million from equity funds provided by Wynn Resorts for the Wynn Macau project. This guarantee collateral will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A., after the remaining base equity financing set aside by us has been spent. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies, including the estimated lives of our depreciable assets, our annual evaluation of assets for impairment and the purchase price allocations made in connection with acquisitions, require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. As of, and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004, management does not believe there are any highly uncertain matters or other underlying assumptions that would have a material effect on the statement of financial position or results of operations of the Company if actual results differ from our estimates. Critical accounting policies currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements primarily relate to expensing pre opening costs as incurred, capitalizing construction costs, including portions of interest attributable to certain qualifying assets, and other policies related to our development stage status. During the period of the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, direct costs such as those expected to be incurred for the design and construction of the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau hotels and casinos, the Wynn Las Vegas championship golf course and the Wynn Las Vegas water based entertainment production, including interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment will increase significantly. Depreciation expense related to the capitalized construction costs will not be recognized until the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon completion of construction and commencement of operation of Wynn Las Vegas in April 2005 and Wynn Macau in the last half of 2006, depreciation expense recognized based on the estimated useful life of the corresponding asset will have a significant effect on the results of our operations. Results of Operations We will commence operations on April 28, 2005 when Wynn Las Vegas opens to the public. However, we currently are a development stage company. As is customary for a development stage company, revenues are minimal and consequently, we have incurred losses in each period from inception to December 31, 2004. These losses have increased commensurate with increased staff salaries and other pre opening expenses as the Wynn 52 Las Vegas and Wynn Macau projects have progressed. The acceleration of these costs was expected and was included in the project budgets. We do not expect that our operating results prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will be indicative of operating results thereafter. Our operations will no longer include water sales revenues because the last customers, the remaining homes along the Desert Inn golf course were acquired by us in the first quarter of 2004, and our water utility was deregulated and dissolved in the last quarter of 2004. Although we ceased operations of our art gallery and the related retail store as of May 6, 2004, we intend to recommence these operations once Wynn Las Vegas opens. We expect that the revenues associated with these ancillary businesses will be immaterial compared to the revenues that will be associated with the lodging, gaming, dining, entertainment, retail and other operations of our casino resorts. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004, of approximately $205.6 million, a 320% increase over the net loss of approximately $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to increased development activities, such as increased staffing, and financing activities, such as the loss on early retirement of debt. Our minimal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased approximately $36.0 million, or 67%, to $90.0 million, as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Preopening costs increased by $34.5 million to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $46.8 million for 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in pre opening activities, including staffing increases, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Management expects pre opening costs to continue to increase as the development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau progress. In 2004, we sold our existing corporate aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in loss on the sale of assets of approximately $643,000. In addition, depreciation expenses increased as a result of the two aircraft purchases. The increased depreciation of approximately $1.2 million for 2004 compared to 2003 and the additional losses on the sale of assets, primarily the former aircraft, are the primary components of the remaining increase in total expenses over the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we benefited from certain significant collections of Desert Inn casino marker receivables totaling approximately $4.2 million. The marker receivables were acquired by us as part of the Desert Inn purchase in June 2000. This gain was used to reduce the carrying value of land in 2004. Other than the marker collections, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 for the future development of a parking facility produced a net loss of approximately $651,000. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately $118.1 million to an expense of approximately $116.8 million from income of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. This loss is attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as part of the refinancing discussed below (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing), we 53 recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflects the tender price on approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the writeoffs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2004 there was a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense, and an approximately $1.7 million decrease in interest income. Lower interest income is primarily attributable to the decrease in average amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas, while the interest expense decreased due to increased capitalization of interest expense commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas. Comprehensive income decreased from a gain of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to a gain of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the increase and decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our two interest rate swaps entered into during the second quarter of 2003 combined with (for 2004 only) the change in the fair value of two new interest rate swaps that we entered into in connection with the refinancing on December 14, 2004. When we refinanced the Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the interest rate swaps associated with our former credit facilities and entered into two new interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. Although we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million on terminating the former swaps, we are amortizing this amount from other comprehensive income into earnings over the original life of the former swap contracts (December 2006). Both our former and our new interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value are charged, to the extent the hedge is effective (as defined in the accounting pronouncements), directly to comprehensive income. The fair value approximates the amount we would pay or receive if these contracts were settled at the valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments, and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $48.9 million, a $17.2 million or 54% increase over the net loss of approximately $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due to increased development activities. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Consequently, all periods presented were reclassified to conform to this presentation. As a result, the aircraft revenue in 2002 reflects third party charter revenue. The corporate aircraft owned by us subsequent to February 2002, when we sold our first corporate aircraft, have not been licensed for charter services. Accordingly, we no longer have third party charter revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $643,000 increased approximately $99,000 or 18% from total revenues of approximately $544,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to increased patronage of the art gallery and related retail store. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $19.0 million, or 54%, to $54.0 million, as compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to an approximately $22.2 million or 90% increase in pre opening costs to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $3.2 million from approximately $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages, including non recurring employee separation expenses of approximately $1.4 million, and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in 54 pre opening activities as compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect pre opening costs to continue to increase as development of Wynn Las Vegas, and Wynn Macau pre development activities, progress. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses is a result of most current buildings and improvements becoming fully depreciated in June of 2003. Other income/(expense) net for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased by approximately $507,000 to income of approximately $1.3 million from approximately $1.8 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $7.1 million to approximately $9.0 million or 376% over the interest expense of approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due primarily to the commitment fees related to certain of the unused outstanding debt facilities entered into in October 2002. Offsetting the increase in interest expense is an increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of approximately $6.6 million to approximately $10.3 million or 178% over interest income of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the significant increase in invested cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity. Certain trends that may affect development activities and future results of operations In the near term, our development activities may be impacted by various economic factors, including, among other things, the availability and cost of materials, the availability of labor resources, interest rate levels and, specifically in connection with Wynn Macau, foreign exchange rates and legislative and regulatory issues relating to gaming and taxes. The strength and profitability of our business after our casino resorts open will depend on consumer demand for casino resorts, in general, and for the specific types of luxury amenities that Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will offer. Adverse changes in consumer preferences, discretionary income and general economic conditions, as well as fears of recession, reduced consumer confidence in the economy, the possibility of continued terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East, a resurgence of SARS or another infectious disease or a natural disaster such as the Tsunami that struck southeast Asia in December 2004, could reduce customer demand for the products and services we will offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources We have financed each of our development projects separately at the subsidiaries that will own and operate them. As of December 31, 2004, we have corporate management and development overhead and two construction projects: Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $330.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. In excess of $300 million of these funds are uncommitted and available for general corporate purposes. In addition, we had approximately $942.4 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. The substantial majority of this amount is restricted for the development and construction of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau, and certain other specific costs in accordance with agreements governing our debt facilities, including but not limited to $698.6 million restricted for the construction, development and preopening expenses of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore, $134.1 million restricted for the development, construction and preopening expenses of Wynn Macau (including a $50.0 million performance bond collateral deposit), $80.0 million restricted for a Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved), approximately $29.7 million restricted for the next four semi annual interest payments through July 15, 2007, on our 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2015 (the Debentures) and small amounts committed for certain sales tax and other deposits. Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Companys debt facilities. 55 Financing for Wynn Las Vegas and Encore As of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.0 billion of the total Wynn Las Vegas project cost, (including the cost of the land, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged Second Mortgage Notes, and our previous debt facilities. On December 14, 2004, as described in more detail below, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas debt structure and raised the additional funds needed to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the intended expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of financial maturity. In addition, it provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets. In May 2004, we amended documents governing our former credit facilities to release from certain development and other restrictions, the approximately 20 acres on which the remaining buildings of the former Desert Inn Resort and Casino then stood, so that the land would be available for what is to become Encore. The land was then used to collateralize a $143.4 million borrowing (the Land Loan) under a credit agreement bearing interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 5.5%. The proceeds of the Land Loan were used to fund a portion of the costs of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore. Later in May 2004, we completed a public offering of seven million shares of our common stock at a price of $38.75 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $268.2 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes, as discussed below, and the remaining portion of the net proceeds to help finance Wynn Macau. On June 14, 2004, pursuant to the indenture governing the Second Mortgage Notes, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (collectively, the Issuers), redeemed approximately $122.4 million of the $370 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes outstanding. The total price of the redemption was approximately $138.9 million, equal to 112.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with the redemption, we wrote off approximately $7.0 million of the unamortized original issue discount and approximately $3.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes. Accordingly, we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt in the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $25.6 million to reflect the write offs and the $14.7 million redemption premium. In November and December 2004, we completed the sale of 8,625,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $61.00 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $521.2 million. Of the net proceeds, $400.0 million was directly contributed to the Wynn Las Vegas project. The remaining amounts will be used for general corporate purposes. During 2004, we continued to borrow available amounts under our former credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, we completed a refinancing of our indebtedness whereby the Issuers: Issued $1.3 billion of First Mortgage Notes; Redeemed $237.4 million of the outstanding $247.6 million of Second Mortgage Notes; Repaid the outstanding $143.4 million balance on the Land Loan described above; Repaid the outstanding $250.0 million balance of term loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $208.6 million balance of revolving credit loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $70.3 million balance of loans under our previous furniture, fixtures and equipment loan facility (the FF& E Facility); 56 Entered into a new $1.0 billion credit facility (See New Credit Facilities, below); Terminated the two former interest rate swap agreements hedging the interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of variable rate borrowings under our previous credit facilities; and Entered into two new interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $400 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. In connection with this refinancing, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $97.2 million. This loss consists of the Second Mortgage Notes tender premium and associated consent fees of approximately $62.9 million, prepayment penalties on the FF&E Facility of approximately $1.6 million, the writeoff of the tendered portion of the original issue discount relating to the Second Mortgage Notes of approximately $12.6 million and writeoffs of debt issue costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes and the former debt facilities of approximately $20.1 million. The refinancing lowers our long term interest expense and also provides the financial flexibility for the further development of our real property assets. Also, in connection with the termination of the two former interest rate swaps noted above, we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million. The gain realized from the former swaps is being amortized out of other comprehensive income into earnings through December 2006 (the life of the original swaps). We will fund the costs to complete Wynn Las Vegas (estimated to be approximately $670.0 million at December 31, 2004) pursuant to the Disbursement Agreement, described below (see Disbursement Agreement), that we entered into with the agent for the lenders under the new credit facilities and the trustee under the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes. Under the Disbursement Agreement, we will use funds in the following order of priority: First, by using any cash on hand, including restricted cash available for this purpose, until exhaustion thereof; Second, by using any remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, and the proceeds of borrowings under the new credit facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the new credit facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the new credit facilities; and Fourth, by using the funds made available to us on a gradual basis from the $50 million completion guarantee deposit account and the $30 million liquidity reserve account. We expect to have sufficient funds from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities to complete construction of Wynn Las Vegas without using any funds from the completion guarantee or liquidity reserve account. Any construction delays or scope changes with respect to Wynn Las Vegas may result in having to utilize these funds or in our borrowing additional funds under the new credit facilities. Through December 31, 2004, we have funded approximately $26.3 million of costs associated with the design and predevelopment of Encore. Until such time as the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have been submitted by us and approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities pursuant to the terms of the disbursement agreement, the new disbursement agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million to pay for development costs for Encore. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved by June 30, 2005, then we expect to fund construction of Encore with remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, borrowings under our new credit facilities and future cash flows from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas. We will fund the costs of development and construction of Encore pursuant to the disbursement agreement, with funds utilized in the same order of priority as indicated above for Wynn Las Vegas. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are not approved by June 30, 2005, the amount available under the new credit facilities, and the amount of indebtedness that the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes will permit us to incur for this purpose, will be reduced by $550.0 million. 57 We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. Our two new interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under our new credit facilities in accordance Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). As of December 31, 2004, we recorded approximately $583,000 in other assets to reflect their fair value. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive if these contracts were settled at December 31, 2004. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Financing for Wynn Macau As of December 31, 2004, approximately $123.2 million of the total Wynn Macau project cost, (including the cost of the land payments, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital and the proceeds from intercompany loans. On September 14, 2004, we completed the financing for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement or CTA) and related ancillary agreements for a senior secured bank facility of $397.0 million. The senior secured bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of $382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until previously funded base equity (in the form of intercompany loans bearing 6.25% annual interest) of $230.0 million and scheduled subordinated funding (in the form of an intercompany loans bearing interest at 7.5%) of $122.0 million have been expended for the construction and development of Wynn Macau. Commencing on September 14, 2007, the principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments. During the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal is due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.00% of the principal is due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.00% of the principal is due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.00% of the principal is due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal is due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011, with annual interest charged at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) (as denominated) plus 3.5%. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it are charged annual interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%. The loans are secured by a collateral package consisting of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Wynn Resorts that are direct or indirect shareholders of Wynn Macau, S.A. have executed a guarantee of the loans and pledged their shares in Wynn Macau, S.A. or upstream intermediate companies, as the case may be, as additional security. Existing cash balances from Wynn Resorts, including amounts spent to date on Wynn Macau and $50 million deposited with Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) as collateral for a bank guarantee as discussed further below, provide the $230 million of base equity to Wynn Macau, S.A, required under the financing documents. In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase $122 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the contributions and loans and the subordinated notes must be expended for Wynn Macau project costs prior to borrowing under the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts provided $30 million of contingent funds that is available to pay additional costs of construction, if necessary. 58 The CTA contains capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants, customary for a limited recourse project financing, as well as restrictions on the use of up front premia derived from subconcessions (See Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project below for further information). In September 2004, in connection with the financing of the Wynn Macau project, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into a Bank Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement with BNU for a guarantee in the amount of 700.0 million patacas (approximately US$87.5 million). This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. To secure the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited $50.0 million of the $230.0 million base equity funding with BNU, which deposit will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A. after the remainder of its base equity has been spent. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the senior bank facilities, Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. The guarantee is further secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed approximately 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Expected Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2004 of our expected long term indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Long Term Indebtedness Total Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years First Mortgage Notes $ 1,300.0 $ $ $ $ 1,300.0 Convertible Subordinated Debentures(1) 250.0 250.0 Term Loans(2) 26.6 26.6 Second Mortgage Notes(3) 10.1 10.1 Other Long Term Obligations(4) 14.9 0.8 1.6 1.6 10.9 Total long term indebtedness 1,601.6 0.8 11.7 1.6 1,587.5 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years Construction contracts(5) $ 805.9 $ 383.8 $ 422.1 $ $ Wynn Macau senior bank facility(6) 397.0 22.1 97.0 277.9 Term Loans(2) 373.4 373.4 Revolver(7) Employment agreements(8) 91.8 24.3 37.0 9.2 21.3 Leasehold interest in land(9) 37.4 9.5 16.3 11.6 Operating leases 12.3 2.0 1.9 0.7 7.7 Estimated interest payments on long term debt(10) 1,244.7 131.9 280.1 274.8 557.9 Total commercial commitments $ 2,962.5 $ 551.5 $ 779.5 $ 393.3 $ 1,238.2 (1) Represents the full obligation under the Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Debentures are convertible, at the holders option, into a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. 59 (2) As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowed approximately $26.5 million of the available $400.0 million under the Term Loans. We are contractually required to borrow the remaining availability of $373.4 million by March 14, 2005. The Term Loans mature on December 14, 2011. (3) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. (4) Represents approximately $14.7 million owing pursuant to loans for one of our corporate aircraft and an annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The aircraft notes bear interest at 5.67% and require monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in 2011. The annuity bears interest at an annual rate of 8% and requires payment of $5,000 per month until February 2009. (5) Represents obligations under our signed construction contracts with Marnell Corrao, Wadsworth Golf Construction Company, Bomel Construction Company, Inc., Leighton/China State and certain other construction companies in connection with the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. We expect to satisfy some of the payment obligations under these contracts using amounts borrowed under the long term indebtedness shown above. Construction contracts and other related purchase commitments relating to Wynn Macau exceed the requirement to spend 4.0 billion patacas (approximately $500.0 million) by 2009 and consequently are expected to satisfy this obligation. (6) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior secured bank facility. However, we anticipate that we will borrow the available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macay by the third quarter of 2006. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011. (7) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under the Revolver. The $600.0 million available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore. The Revolver matures on December 14, 2009. (8) We have entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management, and certain key employees. These agreements generally have three to five year terms, typically indicate a base salary with specified annual increases, and often contain provisions for guaranteed bonuses. If we terminate certain executives without cause or if certain executives terminate employment with us for good reason following a change of control (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts), we will pay the executive a separation payment in a lump sum, which typically is equal to the base salary of the remaining term of the employment contract plus foregone bonuses, plus certain other payments. Amounts represent the aggregate contractual salaries and guaranteed bonuses during the periods specified in the agreements. (9) In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for the 20 year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2004, we had 10 semi annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest as specified in the land concession contract. (10) Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments, anticipated LIBOR rates based upon expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected levels of borrowings and the timing of repayments. New Credit Facilities On December 14, 2004, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for secured revolving credit and term loan facilities in the 60 aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. The credit facilities consist of a revolving credit facility (the Revolver) in the amount of $600.0 million and a term loan facility (the Term Loans) in the amount of $400.0 million. The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loans will mature on December 14, 2011. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to draw half of the Term Loans by February 14, 2005 and the remaining half of the Term Loans by March 14, 2005. The amount available under the new credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have not been approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the New Credit Agreement by June 30, 2005. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, prepayment of loans under the Term Loans, or any combination of the two. For purposes of calculating interest, loans under the new credit facilities will be designated, at the election of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as Eurodollar Loans or, in certain circumstances, Base Rate Loans. Eurodollar Loans under the Revolver and Term Loans are expected to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and LIBOR plus 2.125%, respectively. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. Base Rate Loans are expected to bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin 1.25% or 1.125% under the Revolver and Term Loans, respectively. Interest on Base Rate Loans is payable quarterly in arrears. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for revolving loans will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum for Eurodollar Loans and 0.25% to 1.5% per annum for Base Rate Loans. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will pay, quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the annual fee that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum. For unborrowed amounts under the term loan facility, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects to pay, quarterly in arrears, 1.00% per annum on the daily average of the unborrowed amounts under the Term Loans. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the new credit facilities are expected to accrue fees at the borrowing margins payable on Eurodollar Loans as described above, plus a customary fronting fee. In addition, certain fees will be payable on the closing date to certain lenders and other parties to the New Credit Agreement. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt) and, subject to a reinvestment period, asset sale and insurance or condemnation proceeds, in each case with specified exceptions. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas also will be required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio. Mandatory prepayments from asset sales and insurance and condemnation proceeds will be applied to repay the Term Loans and First Mortgage Notes and, in certain events, to repay the Revolver and reduce the revolving credit commitments. Other than with respect to a 1% premium that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay with respect to certain repayments of Term Loans occurring prior to December 14, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will have the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the new credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty. 61 Disbursement Agreement The Disbursement Agreement sets forth Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs material obligations to complete the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino resort and, if applicable, develop, construct and complete Encore (collectively, the Projects) and establishes mechanics for approval of a line item budget and a schedule for the completion of construction of Wynn Las Vegas and, if and when applicable, the construction of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement also establishes the conditions to, and the relative sequencing of, the making of advances and disbursements under the new credit facilities and from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, and establishes the obligations of the lenders and the administrative agent under the new credit facilities to advance and disburse, respectively, funds under the new credit facilities and the obligation of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee to release funds from the First Mortgage Notes proceeds account upon satisfaction of such conditions. The Disbursement Agreement also sets forth the mechanics for approving change orders and amendments to the construction budgets and the construction schedules for the Projects. The Disbursement Agreement includes certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that relate to construction of the Projects. Under the Disbursement Agreement, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is permitted to use the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and borrowings under the new credit facilities to pay for costs related to the development, construction, outfitting and opening of the Projects (including financing costs and interest during construction) and, subject to certain limitations, corporate overhead and related costs (collectively, Project Costs). Except as provided in the following paragraph, the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will not be available to pay Project Costs related to Encore until a majority of the arrangers (by number) or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities (in consultation with the construction consultant) have approved, among other things, the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications and certain construction related agreements (including certain material construction and design contracts), and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC shall have satisfied certain other conditions precedent relating to Encore. Prior to the approval of the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications, as set forth above, the Disbursement Agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate from the borrowings under the new credit facilities and the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes to pay for Project Costs related to Encore pursuant to abbreviated disbursement procedures set forth in the Disbursement Agreement. No more than $100.0 million from the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will be disbursed for application toward Project Costs related to Encore prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Thereafter, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved, the entire amount of the borrowings under the new credit facilities (subject to exceptions for working capital and other purposes, including amounts necessary for final completion of Wynn Las Vegas) and the remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will be available for application toward Project Costs related to Encore in accordance with the Disbursement Agreement. The Disbursement Agreement sets forth the order in which funds from the various sources will be made available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects that a significant portion of the funds needed to pay Project Costs in respect of Encore will come from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs operating cash flows after opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs failure to achieve operating cash flows, or obtain other funds, sufficient to fund certain of the Project Costs for Encore would prevent Wynn Las Vegas, LLC from obtaining disbursements and may cause an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement and, as a result, under the Indenture and the Credit Agreement. In order to implement the funding of disbursements, the Disbursement Agreement calls for the maintenance of certain accounts, each of which will, subject to certain exceptions, secure Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes; provided that the secured account holding the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the First Mortgage Notes, and the secured account holding the proceeds of the new credit facilities will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations to the lenders under the new credit facilities. The accounts will include a 62 companys funds account, a notes proceeds account, a bank proceeds account, a disbursement account, a cash management account, a completion guarantee deposit account and a liquidity reserve account. The Disbursement Agreement obligates Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement, the lenders under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes Trustee will be entitled to suspend their respective obligations to make any further disbursements under the Disbursement Agreement. Provisions under the Disbursement Agreement can be amended or waived by the agent for the New Credit Facilities (acting under the Credit Agreement) without the consent of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee. The Disbursement Agreement will terminate after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas or, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC has elected to construct it, after final completion of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply to Wynn Las Vegas after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas. Upon termination of the Disbursement Agreement, all amounts remaining in any Disbursement Agreement accounts other than amounts on deposit in the liquidity reserve account will be released to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the covenants contained in the Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply. Amounts remaining on deposit in the liquidity reserve account at substantial completion will be available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC under certain circumstances to pay debt service. Upon satisfaction of certain financial tests, amounts remaining in the liquidity reserve account will be applied to repay the revolving loans under the new credit facilities (without a reduction in revolving loan commitments thereunder). Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project On September 14, 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for a senior bank facility of US$397.0 million. The senior bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of US$382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). Proceeds from draws on the term loan facilities will be used for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau, S.A.s destination resort in Macau (the Project). Except for certain specified funding obligations (described below), the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until base equity of US$230.0 million and the subordinated note funding (described below) have been provided to and expended by Wynn Macau, S.A. on the Project, and the other conditions precedent customary for limited recourse project finance construction loans are satisfied. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on September 14, 2007, such that during the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal will be due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.0% of the principal will be due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.0% of the principal will be due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.0% of the principal will be due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal will be due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011 and bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5% per annum. Customary fees and expense were paid by Wynn Macau. Wynn Resorts has provided US$230.0 million of equity funding to be applied to Project costs (including amounts spent to date on the Project and the US$50.0 million deposited with BNU and described below). In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase US$122.0 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the equity funding and subordinated notes must be expended for Project costs prior to funding of the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts has provided US$30.0 million of contingent equity that is available to pay additional 63 costs of construction. Other than the equity, subordinated funding, contingent equity support and clawbacks of certain restricted payments made during the loan term, the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. Wynn Macau, S.A. is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under certain circumstances with certain proceeds from equity issuances (at the Wynn Macau, S.A. level), asset sales, eminent domain, excess cash flow, insurance and subconcessions. Additionally, if substantially all of the Project is lost, damaged, destroyed or declared a total loss, the indebtedness may be accelerated. Other Liquidity Matters New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas or other international or domestic markets, whether through acquisition, investment or development. For example, we have submitted a proposal pursuant to a Request for Concept recently solicited by the Singapore government, for an integrated resort development with a casino in that jurisdiction. This or any other development would require us to obtain additional financing, which could be comprised of a combination of debt and equity. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through a line of subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. In addition, Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Furthermore, if completion of the Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening of our respective resorts will increase correspondingly. Following the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we expect Wynn Las Vegas to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under the new credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the new credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot ensure that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 64 The following table provides information about our long term indebtedness as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Date FaceAmount CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value (in thousands) 6.625% Mortgage Notes December 2014 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,293,500 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures July 2015 250,000 250,000 764,375 Term Loans, interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%, (approximately 4.575% at December 31, 2004) December 2011 26,564 26,564 26,564 12% Second Mortgage Notes(1) November 2010 10,142 9,611 11,359 Note payable airplane; interest at 5.67% September 2011 14,659 14,659 14,659 Note payable land parcel; interest at 8.0% February 2009 212 212 212 $ 1,601,577 $ 1,601,046 $ 2,110,669 (1) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. The estimated fair value reflects the face value of the Second Mortgage Notes reflected at the 112% redemption price at November 1, 2006). The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2004 on our expected long term indebtedness See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR rate at December 31, 2004 equal to 2.45% is used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 0.7 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1,571.0 $ 1,575.0 Average interest rate 5.81 % 5.81 % 5.82 % 5.82 % 5.70 % 5.67 % 5.70 % Variable rate $ $ $ 22.2 $ 26.3 $ 207.4 $ 651.3 $ 907.2 Average interest rate N/A N/A 2.67 % 2.45 % 3.93 % 3.67 % 3.62 % Consistent with our obligation under our former credit facilities to obtain interest rate protection for at least $325 million of borrowings thereunder, in May 2003 and June 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825 million of our expected future borrowings under our former credit facilities, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 4% and LIBOR plus 5.5%, on the former revolving credit facility and the former term loan facility, respectively, and were to mature in October 2008 and October 2009, respectively. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset. The balance of $9.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to those interest rate swaps will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the original contract life of the two interest rate swaps. Also concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of our expected future borrowings under our new term 65 loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two new interest rate swap arrangements, we will receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. These effective dates of the two swaps were designed to correspond with the amounts and timing of our expected borrowings under the new term loan facility. The interest rate swaps are expected to be effective as hedging instruments as long as sufficient LIBOR based borrowings are outstanding under the new term loan facility, and effectively fixes the interest rate on borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.918%. Any ineffectiveness will increase our recorded interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two former interest rate swaps of approximately $8.8 million. Because there had been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount was reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two new interest rate swaps of approximately $583,000. Because there has been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount is reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2004. The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2004 and using estimated future LIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ 333.3 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ $ n/a Average pay rate 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % n/a Average receive rate 2.78 % 3.47 % 4.02 % 4.53 % n/a We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we incurred approximately $122.0 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2004 by approximately $2.5 million. Foreign Currency Risks The currency used in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese renminbi to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese renminbi and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current peg rate for these currencies will remain at the same level. Any change in such peg rate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on certain of our debt instruments. 66 Because Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations under the concession agreement are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenue for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Wynn Macau intends to spend any Macau patacas received on local casino operating expenses. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements. Certain information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our business strategy and development activities as well as other capital spending, financing sources, the effects of regulation (including gaming and tax regulations), expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability and competition. Any statements contained in this Form 10 K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, would, could, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, conditions precedent to funding under the agreement governing the disbursement of the proceeds of certain of our debt and equity offerings and borrowings under our credit facilities, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industry, completion of our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau casino resorts on time and within budget, our intention to fund a substantial portion of the development and construction costs of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore) with anticipated cash flows generated at Wynn Las Vegas, doing business in foreign locations such as Macau (including the risks associated with Macaus developing gaming regulatory framework), new development and construction activities of competitors, our lack of operating history, our dependence on Stephen A. Wynn and existing management, our dependence on a limited number of properties for all of our cash flow, leverage and debt service (including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates), levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, pending or future legal proceedings, changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws, changes in gaming laws or regulations (including the legalization of gaming in certain jurisdictions), applications for licenses and approvals under applicable jurisdictional laws and regulations (including gaming laws and regulations), the impact that an outbreak of an 48 infectious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the impact of a natural disaster, such as the tsunami which struck southeast Asia in December 2004, may have on the travel and leisure industry, and the consequences of the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East and any future security alerts and or terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. Further information on potential factors which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and business are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. Overview Since inception, we have been primarily a casino resort development company. Our efforts have been devoted principally to the development and construction activities described below with respect to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, our casino resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), respectively. Wynn Las Vegas will occupy approximately 197 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and will utilize an additional 18 acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In November 2004, we announced plans for Encore, which will occupy approximately 20 acres of land adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Macau will initially utilize approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A. from the government of Macau in Macaus inner harbor area. We began construction of Wynn Las Vegas in October 2002 and the project is nearing substantial completion. Wynn Las Vegas will have its grand opening on April 28, 2005. We are developing the budget plans and specifications for Encore. We commenced construction on Wynn Macau in June 2004, and in September 2004 obtained the financing necessary to fund its budgeted development, construction and preopening costs. We expect to open Wynn Macau in the third quarter of 2006. There are significant risks associated with any major construction project, and unexpected developments or delays could occur. Our consolidated financial statements also include results from the ownership and operation of our corporate aircraft and the operation of an art gallery, through May 6, 2004, displaying works from The Wynn Collection, which consists of works of fine art from the personal art collection of Stephen A. and Elaine P. Wynn. Through June 2002, we also operated the golf course located on the site of the former Desert Inn in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas The construction of Wynn Las Vegas is nearing substantial completion and remains within the project budget. The contractor has completed the majority of the work and is currently in the process of completing the exterior site work and interior finishes. In support of our pre opening efforts, we are currently occupying the following portions of Wynn Las Vegas under a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) issued by the Clark County Building Department: The Wynn Theater; Meeting and convention facilities; Warehouse and receiving; Engineering and shop areas; and A portion of the administrative offices. We have been accepting room reservations by telephone since January 2005 and on line since February 2005 (at www.wynnlasvegas.com). We also have been booking conventions for more than a year. 49 Wynn Las Vegas project budget, excluding the incremental cost for Encore, was, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.7 billion, including the cost of acquiring approximately 235 acres of land, costs of design and construction, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $2.0 billion of project costs for Wynn Las Vegas primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes), and a portion of our former credit facilities. We estimated that approximately $670.0 million would be needed as of that date to complete Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2004, we contributed $400.0 million to Wynn Las Vegas,LLC from the proceeds of the November 2004 offering of 7.5 million shares of our common stock. Also, on December 14, 2004, we effected a series of transactions to refinance Wynn Las Vegas debt and raise additional funds for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. These transactions included, among other things, issuance of $1.3 billion of 6.625% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes), a tender offer for all of the outstanding Second Mortgage Notes, discharge of the remaining Second Mortgage Notes, and replacement of our previous credit facilities with new credit facilities. The new credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% on the revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and LIBOR plus 2.125% on the term loan facility (the Term Loans). The refinancing lowered our overall cost of borrowing and provided the financial flexibility to allow for the further development of our real estate assets. The $400.0 million contribution from our common stock offering, a portion of the remaining proceeds of our First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities are expected to provide sufficient funds to complete and open Wynn Las Vegas. In addition, we have a $50.0 million completion guarantee balance and a $30.0 million liquidity reserve available for Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Resorts is not a guarantor of the new financing and is not obligated to apply any of its funds to the Wynn Las Vegas project, although it has more than $300.0 million in cash that can be made available. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas The Company continues to refine the scope and design of Encore. Previously, Encore was to include a hotel tower with approximately 1,500 mini suites, a small amount of ancillary gaming space, restaurants, a spa, swimming pools, additional retail and approximately 30,000 square feet of meeting rooms. It was expected to cost no more than $900 million and to open in the second half of 2007. As initially planned, Encore was an addition to Wynn Las Vegas. Due to anticipated demand for Wynn Las Vegas, continued strength in the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, the Company anticipates a significant increase in the scope of Encore, elevating it to the status of a free standing casino resort; one which is integrated with Wynn Las Vegas through its public space. Although the scope and design of the project have not been finalized and remain subject to board of director approval, we now expect that Encore will include approximately 2,000 full suites in its hotel tower meaning separate living rooms and bedrooms in each unit as well as significant additional casino, convention and meeting space, additional entertainment venues, restaurants, a spa and salon, swimming pools and retail space. We currently anticipate that Encore will open in the first half of 2008. We expect that the remaining proceeds from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs sale of first mortgage notes on December 14, 2004, together with availability under its existing credit facilities and cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.4 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. The availability of notes proceeds and funds under the credit agreement in excess of $100 million is subject to approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications by the majority of arrangers or lenders. Once we have finalized the scope and plans for Encore, we will seek necessary consents and approvals from our lenders and noteholders. 50 Wynn Macau We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first hotel and casino resort in Macau, under a 20 year concession agreement with the government of Macau granted in June 2002 to our indirect subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A. Although we continue to refine the design of the resort, including potential expansion and improvements, Wynn Macau is currently expected to occupy approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A., and include approximately 600 hotel rooms, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 28,000 square feet of retail space, and a spa, salon and entertainment facilities. In September 2004, we acquired all of the 17.5% indirect economic interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. that were formerly held by third parties in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of our common stock. Consequently, we now own 100% of the economic interest and control 90% of the voting interest of Wynn Macau, S.A. indirectly through various subsidiaries. Macau law requires that the position of executive director and at least 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A. be held by a resident of Macau. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, a Macau permanent resident who is the executive director of Wynn Macau, S.A., owns 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A., although he has only nominal (up to 1 Macau pataca) dividend participation rights. Design and construction of Wynn Macau is progressing on schedule and within budget. The resort is expected to open in the third quarter of 2006. Detailed interior design work is continuing, with the majority of architectural and structural design work now complete. Construction is progressing well with piling and other in ground activities substantially complete. Superstructure works are well underway with the hotel tower reaching the fourth floor level. Construction activities since groundbreaking include the following: Piling work is complete; Construction of basement plant and tunnel areas is substantially complete; The hotel tower structure has reached the fourth floor level; Structural floor slabs for the main casino area are approximately 90% complete; and Approximately 1,500 tons of structural steel has been erected in the main casino area and the second floor office area. Wynn Macaus project budget is approximately $704.0 million. This includes land acquisition costs of approximately $40.6 million, construction and design costs of approximately $425.0 million, plus capitalized interest, preopening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies, but excludes up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments that are anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $123.2 million of project costs and estimated that approximately $580.8 million would be required as of that date to complete Wynn Macau. These costs are being, and will continue to be, funded from the existing cash balances of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions, intercompany loans (including up to $122.0 million from Wynn Las Vegas, LLC as provided under its existing indebtedness) and or subordinated funding, as well as the available senior secured credit facility described more fully below. In September 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. obtained the financing necessary to carry out its development plans and maintain the financial capacity to adequately operate its gaming business in Macau. From a combination of capital contributions and intercompany loans bearing an annual interest rate of 6.25%, we have invested, or will invest, a total of approximately $230.0 million into the Wynn Macau project. In addition, we intend to make an additional subordinated intercompany loan for approximately $122.0 million at an interest rate of 7.5%. The remaining $352.0 million to fund the budgeted project costs will be provided in the form of a base term loan as part of a $397.0 million senior secured bank facility entered into by Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition to the base term loan and to cover any potential owner generated cost overruns, we have established a $30.0 million contingent equity funding source in the form of an intercompany loan and have available a $30.0 million 51 contingent debt facility. The senior secured bank facility also includes a working capital facility of $15.0 million. Agreements governing the senior bank facility specify the sequencing of funding sources. Prior to borrowing under the senior bank facility, we must first utilize the majority of the cash balances funded to the Wynn Macau project. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated by its casino concession agreement, and has obtained, a 700.0 million pataca (approximately $87.5 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) that is effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this required guarantee will be reduced to 300.0 million patacas (approximately $37.5 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. As part of the security for the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited with BNU, $50.0 million from equity funds provided by Wynn Resorts for the Wynn Macau project. This guarantee collateral will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A., after the remaining base equity financing set aside by us has been spent. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies, including the estimated lives of our depreciable assets, our annual evaluation of assets for impairment and the purchase price allocations made in connection with acquisitions, require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. As of, and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004, management does not believe there are any highly uncertain matters or other underlying assumptions that would have a material effect on the statement of financial position or results of operations of the Company if actual results differ from our estimates. Critical accounting policies currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements primarily relate to expensing pre opening costs as incurred, capitalizing construction costs, including portions of interest attributable to certain qualifying assets, and other policies related to our development stage status. During the period of the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, direct costs such as those expected to be incurred for the design and construction of the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau hotels and casinos, the Wynn Las Vegas championship golf course and the Wynn Las Vegas water based entertainment production, including interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment will increase significantly. Depreciation expense related to the capitalized construction costs will not be recognized until the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon completion of construction and commencement of operation of Wynn Las Vegas in April 2005 and Wynn Macau in the last half of 2006, depreciation expense recognized based on the estimated useful life of the corresponding asset will have a significant effect on the results of our operations. Results of Operations We will commence operations on April 28, 2005 when Wynn Las Vegas opens to the public. However, we currently are a development stage company. As is customary for a development stage company, revenues are minimal and consequently, we have incurred losses in each period from inception to December 31, 2004. These losses have increased commensurate with increased staff salaries and other pre opening expenses as the Wynn 52 Las Vegas and Wynn Macau projects have progressed. The acceleration of these costs was expected and was included in the project budgets. We do not expect that our operating results prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will be indicative of operating results thereafter. Our operations will no longer include water sales revenues because the last customers, the remaining homes along the Desert Inn golf course were acquired by us in the first quarter of 2004, and our water utility was deregulated and dissolved in the last quarter of 2004. Although we ceased operations of our art gallery and the related retail store as of May 6, 2004, we intend to recommence these operations once Wynn Las Vegas opens. We expect that the revenues associated with these ancillary businesses will be immaterial compared to the revenues that will be associated with the lodging, gaming, dining, entertainment, retail and other operations of our casino resorts. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004, of approximately $205.6 million, a 320% increase over the net loss of approximately $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to increased development activities, such as increased staffing, and financing activities, such as the loss on early retirement of debt. Our minimal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased approximately $36.0 million, or 67%, to $90.0 million, as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Preopening costs increased by $34.5 million to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $46.8 million for 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in pre opening activities, including staffing increases, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Management expects pre opening costs to continue to increase as the development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau progress. In 2004, we sold our existing corporate aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in loss on the sale of assets of approximately $643,000. In addition, depreciation expenses increased as a result of the two aircraft purchases. The increased depreciation of approximately $1.2 million for 2004 compared to 2003 and the additional losses on the sale of assets, primarily the former aircraft, are the primary components of the remaining increase in total expenses over the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we benefited from certain significant collections of Desert Inn casino marker receivables totaling approximately $4.2 million. The marker receivables were acquired by us as part of the Desert Inn purchase in June 2000. This gain was used to reduce the carrying value of land in 2004. Other than the marker collections, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 for the future development of a parking facility produced a net loss of approximately $651,000. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately $118.1 million to an expense of approximately $116.8 million from income of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. This loss is attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as part of the refinancing discussed below (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing), we 53 recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflects the tender price on approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the writeoffs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2004 there was a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense, and an approximately $1.7 million decrease in interest income. Lower interest income is primarily attributable to the decrease in average amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas, while the interest expense decreased due to increased capitalization of interest expense commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas. Comprehensive income decreased from a gain of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to a gain of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the increase and decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our two interest rate swaps entered into during the second quarter of 2003 combined with (for 2004 only) the change in the fair value of two new interest rate swaps that we entered into in connection with the refinancing on December 14, 2004. When we refinanced the Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the interest rate swaps associated with our former credit facilities and entered into two new interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. Although we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million on terminating the former swaps, we are amortizing this amount from other comprehensive income into earnings over the original life of the former swap contracts (December 2006). Both our former and our new interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value are charged, to the extent the hedge is effective (as defined in the accounting pronouncements), directly to comprehensive income. The fair value approximates the amount we would pay or receive if these contracts were settled at the valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments, and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $48.9 million, a $17.2 million or 54% increase over the net loss of approximately $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due to increased development activities. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Consequently, all periods presented were reclassified to conform to this presentation. As a result, the aircraft revenue in 2002 reflects third party charter revenue. The corporate aircraft owned by us subsequent to February 2002, when we sold our first corporate aircraft, have not been licensed for charter services. Accordingly, we no longer have third party charter revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $643,000 increased approximately $99,000 or 18% from total revenues of approximately $544,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to increased patronage of the art gallery and related retail store. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $19.0 million, or 54%, to $54.0 million, as compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to an approximately $22.2 million or 90% increase in pre opening costs to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $3.2 million from approximately $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages, including non recurring employee separation expenses of approximately $1.4 million, and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in 54 pre opening activities as compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect pre opening costs to continue to increase as development of Wynn Las Vegas, and Wynn Macau pre development activities, progress. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses is a result of most current buildings and improvements becoming fully depreciated in June of 2003. Other income/(expense) net for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased by approximately $507,000 to income of approximately $1.3 million from approximately $1.8 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $7.1 million to approximately $9.0 million or 376% over the interest expense of approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due primarily to the commitment fees related to certain of the unused outstanding debt facilities entered into in October 2002. Offsetting the increase in interest expense is an increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of approximately $6.6 million to approximately $10.3 million or 178% over interest income of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the significant increase in invested cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity. Certain trends that may affect development activities and future results of operations In the near term, our development activities may be impacted by various economic factors, including, among other things, the availability and cost of materials, the availability of labor resources, interest rate levels and, specifically in connection with Wynn Macau, foreign exchange rates and legislative and regulatory issues relating to gaming and taxes. The strength and profitability of our business after our casino resorts open will depend on consumer demand for casino resorts, in general, and for the specific types of luxury amenities that Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will offer. Adverse changes in consumer preferences, discretionary income and general economic conditions, as well as fears of recession, reduced consumer confidence in the economy, the possibility of continued terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East, a resurgence of SARS or another infectious disease or a natural disaster such as the Tsunami that struck southeast Asia in December 2004, could reduce customer demand for the products and services we will offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources We have financed each of our development projects separately at the subsidiaries that will own and operate them. As of December 31, 2004, we have corporate management and development overhead and two construction projects: Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $330.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. In excess of $300 million of these funds are uncommitted and available for general corporate purposes. In addition, we had approximately $942.4 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. The substantial majority of this amount is restricted for the development and construction of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau, and certain other specific costs in accordance with agreements governing our debt facilities, including but not limited to $698.6 million restricted for the construction, development and preopening expenses of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore, $134.1 million restricted for the development, construction and preopening expenses of Wynn Macau (including a $50.0 million performance bond collateral deposit), $80.0 million restricted for a Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved), approximately $29.7 million restricted for the next four semi annual interest payments through July 15, 2007, on our 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2015 (the Debentures) and small amounts committed for certain sales tax and other deposits. Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Companys debt facilities. 55 Financing for Wynn Las Vegas and Encore As of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.0 billion of the total Wynn Las Vegas project cost, (including the cost of the land, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged Second Mortgage Notes, and our previous debt facilities. On December 14, 2004, as described in more detail below, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas debt structure and raised the additional funds needed to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the intended expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of financial maturity. In addition, it provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets. In May 2004, we amended documents governing our former credit facilities to release from certain development and other restrictions, the approximately 20 acres on which the remaining buildings of the former Desert Inn Resort and Casino then stood, so that the land would be available for what is to become Encore. The land was then used to collateralize a $143.4 million borrowing (the Land Loan) under a credit agreement bearing interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 5.5%. The proceeds of the Land Loan were used to fund a portion of the costs of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore. Later in May 2004, we completed a public offering of seven million shares of our common stock at a price of $38.75 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $268.2 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes, as discussed below, and the remaining portion of the net proceeds to help finance Wynn Macau. On June 14, 2004, pursuant to the indenture governing the Second Mortgage Notes, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (collectively, the Issuers), redeemed approximately $122.4 million of the $370 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes outstanding. The total price of the redemption was approximately $138.9 million, equal to 112.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with the redemption, we wrote off approximately $7.0 million of the unamortized original issue discount and approximately $3.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes. Accordingly, we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt in the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $25.6 million to reflect the write offs and the $14.7 million redemption premium. In November and December 2004, we completed the sale of 8,625,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $61.00 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $521.2 million. Of the net proceeds, $400.0 million was directly contributed to the Wynn Las Vegas project. The remaining amounts will be used for general corporate purposes. During 2004, we continued to borrow available amounts under our former credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, we completed a refinancing of our indebtedness whereby the Issuers: Issued $1.3 billion of First Mortgage Notes; Redeemed $237.4 million of the outstanding $247.6 million of Second Mortgage Notes; Repaid the outstanding $143.4 million balance on the Land Loan described above; Repaid the outstanding $250.0 million balance of term loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $208.6 million balance of revolving credit loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $70.3 million balance of loans under our previous furniture, fixtures and equipment loan facility (the FF& E Facility); 56 Entered into a new $1.0 billion credit facility (See New Credit Facilities, below); Terminated the two former interest rate swap agreements hedging the interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of variable rate borrowings under our previous credit facilities; and Entered into two new interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $400 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. In connection with this refinancing, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $97.2 million. This loss consists of the Second Mortgage Notes tender premium and associated consent fees of approximately $62.9 million, prepayment penalties on the FF&E Facility of approximately $1.6 million, the writeoff of the tendered portion of the original issue discount relating to the Second Mortgage Notes of approximately $12.6 million and writeoffs of debt issue costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes and the former debt facilities of approximately $20.1 million. The refinancing lowers our long term interest expense and also provides the financial flexibility for the further development of our real property assets. Also, in connection with the termination of the two former interest rate swaps noted above, we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million. The gain realized from the former swaps is being amortized out of other comprehensive income into earnings through December 2006 (the life of the original swaps). We will fund the costs to complete Wynn Las Vegas (estimated to be approximately $670.0 million at December 31, 2004) pursuant to the Disbursement Agreement, described below (see Disbursement Agreement), that we entered into with the agent for the lenders under the new credit facilities and the trustee under the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes. Under the Disbursement Agreement, we will use funds in the following order of priority: First, by using any cash on hand, including restricted cash available for this purpose, until exhaustion thereof; Second, by using any remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, and the proceeds of borrowings under the new credit facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the new credit facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the new credit facilities; and Fourth, by using the funds made available to us on a gradual basis from the $50 million completion guarantee deposit account and the $30 million liquidity reserve account. We expect to have sufficient funds from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities to complete construction of Wynn Las Vegas without using any funds from the completion guarantee or liquidity reserve account. Any construction delays or scope changes with respect to Wynn Las Vegas may result in having to utilize these funds or in our borrowing additional funds under the new credit facilities. Through December 31, 2004, we have funded approximately $26.3 million of costs associated with the design and predevelopment of Encore. Until such time as the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have been submitted by us and approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities pursuant to the terms of the disbursement agreement, the new disbursement agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million to pay for development costs for Encore. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved by June 30, 2005, then we expect to fund construction of Encore with remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, borrowings under our new credit facilities and future cash flows from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas. We will fund the costs of development and construction of Encore pursuant to the disbursement agreement, with funds utilized in the same order of priority as indicated above for Wynn Las Vegas. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are not approved by June 30, 2005, the amount available under the new credit facilities, and the amount of indebtedness that the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes will permit us to incur for this purpose, will be reduced by $550.0 million. 57 We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. Our two new interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under our new credit facilities in accordance Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). As of December 31, 2004, we recorded approximately $583,000 in other assets to reflect their fair value. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive if these contracts were settled at December 31, 2004. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Financing for Wynn Macau As of December 31, 2004, approximately $123.2 million of the total Wynn Macau project cost, (including the cost of the land payments, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital and the proceeds from intercompany loans. On September 14, 2004, we completed the financing for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement or CTA) and related ancillary agreements for a senior secured bank facility of $397.0 million. The senior secured bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of $382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until previously funded base equity (in the form of intercompany loans bearing 6.25% annual interest) of $230.0 million and scheduled subordinated funding (in the form of an intercompany loans bearing interest at 7.5%) of $122.0 million have been expended for the construction and development of Wynn Macau. Commencing on September 14, 2007, the principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments. During the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal is due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.00% of the principal is due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.00% of the principal is due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.00% of the principal is due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal is due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011, with annual interest charged at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) (as denominated) plus 3.5%. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it are charged annual interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%. The loans are secured by a collateral package consisting of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Wynn Resorts that are direct or indirect shareholders of Wynn Macau, S.A. have executed a guarantee of the loans and pledged their shares in Wynn Macau, S.A. or upstream intermediate companies, as the case may be, as additional security. Existing cash balances from Wynn Resorts, including amounts spent to date on Wynn Macau and $50 million deposited with Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) as collateral for a bank guarantee as discussed further below, provide the $230 million of base equity to Wynn Macau, S.A, required under the financing documents. In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase $122 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the contributions and loans and the subordinated notes must be expended for Wynn Macau project costs prior to borrowing under the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts provided $30 million of contingent funds that is available to pay additional costs of construction, if necessary. 58 The CTA contains capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants, customary for a limited recourse project financing, as well as restrictions on the use of up front premia derived from subconcessions (See Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project below for further information). In September 2004, in connection with the financing of the Wynn Macau project, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into a Bank Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement with BNU for a guarantee in the amount of 700.0 million patacas (approximately US$87.5 million). This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. To secure the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited $50.0 million of the $230.0 million base equity funding with BNU, which deposit will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A. after the remainder of its base equity has been spent. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the senior bank facilities, Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. The guarantee is further secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed approximately 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Expected Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2004 of our expected long term indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Long Term Indebtedness Total Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years First Mortgage Notes $ 1,300.0 $ $ $ $ 1,300.0 Convertible Subordinated Debentures(1) 250.0 250.0 Term Loans(2) 26.6 26.6 Second Mortgage Notes(3) 10.1 10.1 Other Long Term Obligations(4) 14.9 0.8 1.6 1.6 10.9 Total long term indebtedness 1,601.6 0.8 11.7 1.6 1,587.5 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years Construction contracts(5) $ 805.9 $ 383.8 $ 422.1 $ $ Wynn Macau senior bank facility(6) 397.0 22.1 97.0 277.9 Term Loans(2) 373.4 373.4 Revolver(7) Employment agreements(8) 91.8 24.3 37.0 9.2 21.3 Leasehold interest in land(9) 37.4 9.5 16.3 11.6 Operating leases 12.3 2.0 1.9 0.7 7.7 Estimated interest payments on long term debt(10) 1,244.7 131.9 280.1 274.8 557.9 Total commercial commitments $ 2,962.5 $ 551.5 $ 779.5 $ 393.3 $ 1,238.2 (1) Represents the full obligation under the Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Debentures are convertible, at the holders option, into a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. 59 (2) As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowed approximately $26.5 million of the available $400.0 million under the Term Loans. We are contractually required to borrow the remaining availability of $373.4 million by March 14, 2005. The Term Loans mature on December 14, 2011. (3) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. (4) Represents approximately $14.7 million owing pursuant to loans for one of our corporate aircraft and an annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The aircraft notes bear interest at 5.67% and require monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in 2011. The annuity bears interest at an annual rate of 8% and requires payment of $5,000 per month until February 2009. (5) Represents obligations under our signed construction contracts with Marnell Corrao, Wadsworth Golf Construction Company, Bomel Construction Company, Inc., Leighton/China State and certain other construction companies in connection with the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. We expect to satisfy some of the payment obligations under these contracts using amounts borrowed under the long term indebtedness shown above. Construction contracts and other related purchase commitments relating to Wynn Macau exceed the requirement to spend 4.0 billion patacas (approximately $500.0 million) by 2009 and consequently are expected to satisfy this obligation. (6) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior secured bank facility. However, we anticipate that we will borrow the available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macay by the third quarter of 2006. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011. (7) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under the Revolver. The $600.0 million available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore. The Revolver matures on December 14, 2009. (8) We have entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management, and certain key employees. These agreements generally have three to five year terms, typically indicate a base salary with specified annual increases, and often contain provisions for guaranteed bonuses. If we terminate certain executives without cause or if certain executives terminate employment with us for good reason following a change of control (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts), we will pay the executive a separation payment in a lump sum, which typically is equal to the base salary of the remaining term of the employment contract plus foregone bonuses, plus certain other payments. Amounts represent the aggregate contractual salaries and guaranteed bonuses during the periods specified in the agreements. (9) In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for the 20 year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2004, we had 10 semi annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest as specified in the land concession contract. (10) Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments, anticipated LIBOR rates based upon expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected levels of borrowings and the timing of repayments. New Credit Facilities On December 14, 2004, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for secured revolving credit and term loan facilities in the 60 aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. The credit facilities consist of a revolving credit facility (the Revolver) in the amount of $600.0 million and a term loan facility (the Term Loans) in the amount of $400.0 million. The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loans will mature on December 14, 2011. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to draw half of the Term Loans by February 14, 2005 and the remaining half of the Term Loans by March 14, 2005. The amount available under the new credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have not been approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the New Credit Agreement by June 30, 2005. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, prepayment of loans under the Term Loans, or any combination of the two. For purposes of calculating interest, loans under the new credit facilities will be designated, at the election of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as Eurodollar Loans or, in certain circumstances, Base Rate Loans. Eurodollar Loans under the Revolver and Term Loans are expected to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and LIBOR plus 2.125%, respectively. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. Base Rate Loans are expected to bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin 1.25% or 1.125% under the Revolver and Term Loans, respectively. Interest on Base Rate Loans is payable quarterly in arrears. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for revolving loans will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum for Eurodollar Loans and 0.25% to 1.5% per annum for Base Rate Loans. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will pay, quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the annual fee that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum. For unborrowed amounts under the term loan facility, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects to pay, quarterly in arrears, 1.00% per annum on the daily average of the unborrowed amounts under the Term Loans. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the new credit facilities are expected to accrue fees at the borrowing margins payable on Eurodollar Loans as described above, plus a customary fronting fee. In addition, certain fees will be payable on the closing date to certain lenders and other parties to the New Credit Agreement. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt) and, subject to a reinvestment period, asset sale and insurance or condemnation proceeds, in each case with specified exceptions. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas also will be required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio. Mandatory prepayments from asset sales and insurance and condemnation proceeds will be applied to repay the Term Loans and First Mortgage Notes and, in certain events, to repay the Revolver and reduce the revolving credit commitments. Other than with respect to a 1% premium that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay with respect to certain repayments of Term Loans occurring prior to December 14, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will have the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the new credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty. 61 Disbursement Agreement The Disbursement Agreement sets forth Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs material obligations to complete the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino resort and, if applicable, develop, construct and complete Encore (collectively, the Projects) and establishes mechanics for approval of a line item budget and a schedule for the completion of construction of Wynn Las Vegas and, if and when applicable, the construction of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement also establishes the conditions to, and the relative sequencing of, the making of advances and disbursements under the new credit facilities and from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, and establishes the obligations of the lenders and the administrative agent under the new credit facilities to advance and disburse, respectively, funds under the new credit facilities and the obligation of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee to release funds from the First Mortgage Notes proceeds account upon satisfaction of such conditions. The Disbursement Agreement also sets forth the mechanics for approving change orders and amendments to the construction budgets and the construction schedules for the Projects. The Disbursement Agreement includes certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that relate to construction of the Projects. Under the Disbursement Agreement, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is permitted to use the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and borrowings under the new credit facilities to pay for costs related to the development, construction, outfitting and opening of the Projects (including financing costs and interest during construction) and, subject to certain limitations, corporate overhead and related costs (collectively, Project Costs). Except as provided in the following paragraph, the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will not be available to pay Project Costs related to Encore until a majority of the arrangers (by number) or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities (in consultation with the construction consultant) have approved, among other things, the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications and certain construction related agreements (including certain material construction and design contracts), and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC shall have satisfied certain other conditions precedent relating to Encore. Prior to the approval of the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications, as set forth above, the Disbursement Agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate from the borrowings under the new credit facilities and the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes to pay for Project Costs related to Encore pursuant to abbreviated disbursement procedures set forth in the Disbursement Agreement. No more than $100.0 million from the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will be disbursed for application toward Project Costs related to Encore prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Thereafter, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved, the entire amount of the borrowings under the new credit facilities (subject to exceptions for working capital and other purposes, including amounts necessary for final completion of Wynn Las Vegas) and the remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will be available for application toward Project Costs related to Encore in accordance with the Disbursement Agreement. The Disbursement Agreement sets forth the order in which funds from the various sources will be made available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects that a significant portion of the funds needed to pay Project Costs in respect of Encore will come from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs operating cash flows after opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs failure to achieve operating cash flows, or obtain other funds, sufficient to fund certain of the Project Costs for Encore would prevent Wynn Las Vegas, LLC from obtaining disbursements and may cause an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement and, as a result, under the Indenture and the Credit Agreement. In order to implement the funding of disbursements, the Disbursement Agreement calls for the maintenance of certain accounts, each of which will, subject to certain exceptions, secure Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes; provided that the secured account holding the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the First Mortgage Notes, and the secured account holding the proceeds of the new credit facilities will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations to the lenders under the new credit facilities. The accounts will include a 62 companys funds account, a notes proceeds account, a bank proceeds account, a disbursement account, a cash management account, a completion guarantee deposit account and a liquidity reserve account. The Disbursement Agreement obligates Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement, the lenders under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes Trustee will be entitled to suspend their respective obligations to make any further disbursements under the Disbursement Agreement. Provisions under the Disbursement Agreement can be amended or waived by the agent for the New Credit Facilities (acting under the Credit Agreement) without the consent of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee. The Disbursement Agreement will terminate after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas or, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC has elected to construct it, after final completion of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply to Wynn Las Vegas after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas. Upon termination of the Disbursement Agreement, all amounts remaining in any Disbursement Agreement accounts other than amounts on deposit in the liquidity reserve account will be released to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the covenants contained in the Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply. Amounts remaining on deposit in the liquidity reserve account at substantial completion will be available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC under certain circumstances to pay debt service. Upon satisfaction of certain financial tests, amounts remaining in the liquidity reserve account will be applied to repay the revolving loans under the new credit facilities (without a reduction in revolving loan commitments thereunder). Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project On September 14, 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for a senior bank facility of US$397.0 million. The senior bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of US$382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). Proceeds from draws on the term loan facilities will be used for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau, S.A.s destination resort in Macau (the Project). Except for certain specified funding obligations (described below), the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until base equity of US$230.0 million and the subordinated note funding (described below) have been provided to and expended by Wynn Macau, S.A. on the Project, and the other conditions precedent customary for limited recourse project finance construction loans are satisfied. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on September 14, 2007, such that during the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal will be due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.0% of the principal will be due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.0% of the principal will be due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.0% of the principal will be due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal will be due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011 and bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5% per annum. Customary fees and expense were paid by Wynn Macau. Wynn Resorts has provided US$230.0 million of equity funding to be applied to Project costs (including amounts spent to date on the Project and the US$50.0 million deposited with BNU and described below). In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase US$122.0 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the equity funding and subordinated notes must be expended for Project costs prior to funding of the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts has provided US$30.0 million of contingent equity that is available to pay additional 63 costs of construction. Other than the equity, subordinated funding, contingent equity support and clawbacks of certain restricted payments made during the loan term, the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. Wynn Macau, S.A. is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under certain circumstances with certain proceeds from equity issuances (at the Wynn Macau, S.A. level), asset sales, eminent domain, excess cash flow, insurance and subconcessions. Additionally, if substantially all of the Project is lost, damaged, destroyed or declared a total loss, the indebtedness may be accelerated. Other Liquidity Matters New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas or other international or domestic markets, whether through acquisition, investment or development. For example, we have submitted a proposal pursuant to a Request for Concept recently solicited by the Singapore government, for an integrated resort development with a casino in that jurisdiction. This or any other development would require us to obtain additional financing, which could be comprised of a combination of debt and equity. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through a line of subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. In addition, Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Furthermore, if completion of the Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening of our respective resorts will increase correspondingly. Following the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we expect Wynn Las Vegas to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under the new credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the new credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot ensure that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 64 The following table provides information about our long term indebtedness as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Date FaceAmount CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value (in thousands) 6.625% Mortgage Notes December 2014 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,293,500 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures July 2015 250,000 250,000 764,375 Term Loans, interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%, (approximately 4.575% at December 31, 2004) December 2011 26,564 26,564 26,564 12% Second Mortgage Notes(1) November 2010 10,142 9,611 11,359 Note payable airplane; interest at 5.67% September 2011 14,659 14,659 14,659 Note payable land parcel; interest at 8.0% February 2009 212 212 212 $ 1,601,577 $ 1,601,046 $ 2,110,669 (1) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. The estimated fair value reflects the face value of the Second Mortgage Notes reflected at the 112% redemption price at November 1, 2006). The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2004 on our expected long term indebtedness See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR rate at December 31, 2004 equal to 2.45% is used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 0.7 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1,571.0 $ 1,575.0 Average interest rate 5.81 % 5.81 % 5.82 % 5.82 % 5.70 % 5.67 % 5.70 % Variable rate $ $ $ 22.2 $ 26.3 $ 207.4 $ 651.3 $ 907.2 Average interest rate N/A N/A 2.67 % 2.45 % 3.93 % 3.67 % 3.62 % Consistent with our obligation under our former credit facilities to obtain interest rate protection for at least $325 million of borrowings thereunder, in May 2003 and June 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825 million of our expected future borrowings under our former credit facilities, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 4% and LIBOR plus 5.5%, on the former revolving credit facility and the former term loan facility, respectively, and were to mature in October 2008 and October 2009, respectively. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset. The balance of $9.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to those interest rate swaps will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the original contract life of the two interest rate swaps. Also concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of our expected future borrowings under our new term 65 loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two new interest rate swap arrangements, we will receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. These effective dates of the two swaps were designed to correspond with the amounts and timing of our expected borrowings under the new term loan facility. The interest rate swaps are expected to be effective as hedging instruments as long as sufficient LIBOR based borrowings are outstanding under the new term loan facility, and effectively fixes the interest rate on borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.918%. Any ineffectiveness will increase our recorded interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two former interest rate swaps of approximately $8.8 million. Because there had been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount was reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two new interest rate swaps of approximately $583,000. Because there has been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount is reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2004. The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2004 and using estimated future LIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ 333.3 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ $ n/a Average pay rate 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % n/a Average receive rate 2.78 % 3.47 % 4.02 % 4.53 % n/a We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we incurred approximately $122.0 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2004 by approximately $2.5 million. Foreign Currency Risks The currency used in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese renminbi to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese renminbi and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current peg rate for these currencies will remain at the same level. Any change in such peg rate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on certain of our debt instruments. 66 Because Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations under the concession agreement are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenue for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Wynn Macau intends to spend any Macau patacas received on local casino operating expenses. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements. Certain information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains statements that are forward looking, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our business strategy and development activities as well as other capital spending, financing sources, the effects of regulation (including gaming and tax regulations), expectations concerning future operations, margins, profitability and competition. Any statements contained in this Form 10 K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in some cases, you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, would, could, believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Such forward looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, conditions precedent to funding under the agreement governing the disbursement of the proceeds of certain of our debt and equity offerings and borrowings under our credit facilities, competition in the casino/hotel and resorts industry, completion of our Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau casino resorts on time and within budget, our intention to fund a substantial portion of the development and construction costs of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore) with anticipated cash flows generated at Wynn Las Vegas, doing business in foreign locations such as Macau (including the risks associated with Macaus developing gaming regulatory framework), new development and construction activities of competitors, our lack of operating history, our dependence on Stephen A. Wynn and existing management, our dependence on a limited number of properties for all of our cash flow, leverage and debt service (including sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates), levels of travel, leisure and casino spending, general domestic or international economic conditions, pending or future legal proceedings, changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such laws, changes in gaming laws or regulations (including the legalization of gaming in certain jurisdictions), applications for licenses and approvals under applicable jurisdictional laws and regulations (including gaming laws and regulations), the impact that an outbreak of an 48 infectious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the impact of a natural disaster, such as the tsunami which struck southeast Asia in December 2004, may have on the travel and leisure industry, and the consequences of the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East and any future security alerts and or terrorist attacks such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. Further information on potential factors which could affect our financial condition, results of operations and business are included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report. Overview Since inception, we have been primarily a casino resort development company. Our efforts have been devoted principally to the development and construction activities described below with respect to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, our casino resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, and in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), respectively. Wynn Las Vegas will occupy approximately 197 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and will utilize an additional 18 acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In November 2004, we announced plans for Encore, which will occupy approximately 20 acres of land adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Macau will initially utilize approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A. from the government of Macau in Macaus inner harbor area. We began construction of Wynn Las Vegas in October 2002 and the project is nearing substantial completion. Wynn Las Vegas will have its grand opening on April 28, 2005. We are developing the budget plans and specifications for Encore. We commenced construction on Wynn Macau in June 2004, and in September 2004 obtained the financing necessary to fund its budgeted development, construction and preopening costs. We expect to open Wynn Macau in the third quarter of 2006. There are significant risks associated with any major construction project, and unexpected developments or delays could occur. Our consolidated financial statements also include results from the ownership and operation of our corporate aircraft and the operation of an art gallery, through May 6, 2004, displaying works from The Wynn Collection, which consists of works of fine art from the personal art collection of Stephen A. and Elaine P. Wynn. Through June 2002, we also operated the golf course located on the site of the former Desert Inn in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas The construction of Wynn Las Vegas is nearing substantial completion and remains within the project budget. The contractor has completed the majority of the work and is currently in the process of completing the exterior site work and interior finishes. In support of our pre opening efforts, we are currently occupying the following portions of Wynn Las Vegas under a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) issued by the Clark County Building Department: The Wynn Theater; Meeting and convention facilities; Warehouse and receiving; Engineering and shop areas; and A portion of the administrative offices. We have been accepting room reservations by telephone since January 2005 and on line since February 2005 (at www.wynnlasvegas.com). We also have been booking conventions for more than a year. 49 Wynn Las Vegas project budget, excluding the incremental cost for Encore, was, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.7 billion, including the cost of acquiring approximately 235 acres of land, costs of design and construction, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $2.0 billion of project costs for Wynn Las Vegas primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes), and a portion of our former credit facilities. We estimated that approximately $670.0 million would be needed as of that date to complete Wynn Las Vegas. In December 2004, we contributed $400.0 million to Wynn Las Vegas,LLC from the proceeds of the November 2004 offering of 7.5 million shares of our common stock. Also, on December 14, 2004, we effected a series of transactions to refinance Wynn Las Vegas debt and raise additional funds for Encore at Wynn Las Vegas. These transactions included, among other things, issuance of $1.3 billion of 6.625% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes), a tender offer for all of the outstanding Second Mortgage Notes, discharge of the remaining Second Mortgage Notes, and replacement of our previous credit facilities with new credit facilities. The new credit facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% on the revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and LIBOR plus 2.125% on the term loan facility (the Term Loans). The refinancing lowered our overall cost of borrowing and provided the financial flexibility to allow for the further development of our real estate assets. The $400.0 million contribution from our common stock offering, a portion of the remaining proceeds of our First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities are expected to provide sufficient funds to complete and open Wynn Las Vegas. In addition, we have a $50.0 million completion guarantee balance and a $30.0 million liquidity reserve available for Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Resorts is not a guarantor of the new financing and is not obligated to apply any of its funds to the Wynn Las Vegas project, although it has more than $300.0 million in cash that can be made available. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas The Company continues to refine the scope and design of Encore. Previously, Encore was to include a hotel tower with approximately 1,500 mini suites, a small amount of ancillary gaming space, restaurants, a spa, swimming pools, additional retail and approximately 30,000 square feet of meeting rooms. It was expected to cost no more than $900 million and to open in the second half of 2007. As initially planned, Encore was an addition to Wynn Las Vegas. Due to anticipated demand for Wynn Las Vegas, continued strength in the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, the Company anticipates a significant increase in the scope of Encore, elevating it to the status of a free standing casino resort; one which is integrated with Wynn Las Vegas through its public space. Although the scope and design of the project have not been finalized and remain subject to board of director approval, we now expect that Encore will include approximately 2,000 full suites in its hotel tower meaning separate living rooms and bedrooms in each unit as well as significant additional casino, convention and meeting space, additional entertainment venues, restaurants, a spa and salon, swimming pools and retail space. We currently anticipate that Encore will open in the first half of 2008. We expect that the remaining proceeds from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs sale of first mortgage notes on December 14, 2004, together with availability under its existing credit facilities and cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.4 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. The availability of notes proceeds and funds under the credit agreement in excess of $100 million is subject to approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications by the majority of arrangers or lenders. Once we have finalized the scope and plans for Encore, we will seek necessary consents and approvals from our lenders and noteholders. 50 Wynn Macau We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first hotel and casino resort in Macau, under a 20 year concession agreement with the government of Macau granted in June 2002 to our indirect subsidiary, Wynn Macau, S.A. Although we continue to refine the design of the resort, including potential expansion and improvements, Wynn Macau is currently expected to occupy approximately 11 acres of the approximately 16 acres of land leased by Wynn Macau, S.A., and include approximately 600 hotel rooms, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 28,000 square feet of retail space, and a spa, salon and entertainment facilities. In September 2004, we acquired all of the 17.5% indirect economic interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. that were formerly held by third parties in exchange for 1,333,333 shares of our common stock. Consequently, we now own 100% of the economic interest and control 90% of the voting interest of Wynn Macau, S.A. indirectly through various subsidiaries. Macau law requires that the position of executive director and at least 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A. be held by a resident of Macau. Mr. Wong Chi Seng, a Macau permanent resident who is the executive director of Wynn Macau, S.A., owns 10% of the voting shares of Wynn Macau, S.A., although he has only nominal (up to 1 Macau pataca) dividend participation rights. Design and construction of Wynn Macau is progressing on schedule and within budget. The resort is expected to open in the third quarter of 2006. Detailed interior design work is continuing, with the majority of architectural and structural design work now complete. Construction is progressing well with piling and other in ground activities substantially complete. Superstructure works are well underway with the hotel tower reaching the fourth floor level. Construction activities since groundbreaking include the following: Piling work is complete; Construction of basement plant and tunnel areas is substantially complete; The hotel tower structure has reached the fourth floor level; Structural floor slabs for the main casino area are approximately 90% complete; and Approximately 1,500 tons of structural steel has been erected in the main casino area and the second floor office area. Wynn Macaus project budget is approximately $704.0 million. This includes land acquisition costs of approximately $40.6 million, construction and design costs of approximately $425.0 million, plus capitalized interest, preopening expenses, financing fees and construction contingencies, but excludes up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments that are anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Through December 31, 2004, we had funded approximately $123.2 million of project costs and estimated that approximately $580.8 million would be required as of that date to complete Wynn Macau. These costs are being, and will continue to be, funded from the existing cash balances of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries in the form of capital contributions, intercompany loans (including up to $122.0 million from Wynn Las Vegas, LLC as provided under its existing indebtedness) and or subordinated funding, as well as the available senior secured credit facility described more fully below. In September 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. obtained the financing necessary to carry out its development plans and maintain the financial capacity to adequately operate its gaming business in Macau. From a combination of capital contributions and intercompany loans bearing an annual interest rate of 6.25%, we have invested, or will invest, a total of approximately $230.0 million into the Wynn Macau project. In addition, we intend to make an additional subordinated intercompany loan for approximately $122.0 million at an interest rate of 7.5%. The remaining $352.0 million to fund the budgeted project costs will be provided in the form of a base term loan as part of a $397.0 million senior secured bank facility entered into by Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition to the base term loan and to cover any potential owner generated cost overruns, we have established a $30.0 million contingent equity funding source in the form of an intercompany loan and have available a $30.0 million 51 contingent debt facility. The senior secured bank facility also includes a working capital facility of $15.0 million. Agreements governing the senior bank facility specify the sequencing of funding sources. Prior to borrowing under the senior bank facility, we must first utilize the majority of the cash balances funded to the Wynn Macau project. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated by its casino concession agreement, and has obtained, a 700.0 million pataca (approximately $87.5 million) bank guarantee from Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) that is effective until March 31, 2007. The amount of this required guarantee will be reduced to 300.0 million patacas (approximately $37.5 million) for the period from April 1, 2007 until 180 days after the end of the term of the concession agreement. This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. As part of the security for the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited with BNU, $50.0 million from equity funds provided by Wynn Resorts for the Wynn Macau project. This guarantee collateral will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A., after the remaining base equity financing set aside by us has been spent. Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated to promptly, upon demand by BNU, repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies, including the estimated lives of our depreciable assets, our annual evaluation of assets for impairment and the purchase price allocations made in connection with acquisitions, require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. As of, and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004, management does not believe there are any highly uncertain matters or other underlying assumptions that would have a material effect on the statement of financial position or results of operations of the Company if actual results differ from our estimates. Critical accounting policies currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements primarily relate to expensing pre opening costs as incurred, capitalizing construction costs, including portions of interest attributable to certain qualifying assets, and other policies related to our development stage status. During the period of the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, direct costs such as those expected to be incurred for the design and construction of the Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau hotels and casinos, the Wynn Las Vegas championship golf course and the Wynn Las Vegas water based entertainment production, including interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment will increase significantly. Depreciation expense related to the capitalized construction costs will not be recognized until the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon completion of construction and commencement of operation of Wynn Las Vegas in April 2005 and Wynn Macau in the last half of 2006, depreciation expense recognized based on the estimated useful life of the corresponding asset will have a significant effect on the results of our operations. Results of Operations We will commence operations on April 28, 2005 when Wynn Las Vegas opens to the public. However, we currently are a development stage company. As is customary for a development stage company, revenues are minimal and consequently, we have incurred losses in each period from inception to December 31, 2004. These losses have increased commensurate with increased staff salaries and other pre opening expenses as the Wynn 52 Las Vegas and Wynn Macau projects have progressed. The acceleration of these costs was expected and was included in the project budgets. We do not expect that our operating results prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will be indicative of operating results thereafter. Our operations will no longer include water sales revenues because the last customers, the remaining homes along the Desert Inn golf course were acquired by us in the first quarter of 2004, and our water utility was deregulated and dissolved in the last quarter of 2004. Although we ceased operations of our art gallery and the related retail store as of May 6, 2004, we intend to recommence these operations once Wynn Las Vegas opens. We expect that the revenues associated with these ancillary businesses will be immaterial compared to the revenues that will be associated with the lodging, gaming, dining, entertainment, retail and other operations of our casino resorts. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004, of approximately $205.6 million, a 320% increase over the net loss of approximately $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to increased development activities, such as increased staffing, and financing activities, such as the loss on early retirement of debt. Our minimal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased approximately $36.0 million, or 67%, to $90.0 million, as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Preopening costs increased by $34.5 million to $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $46.8 million for 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in pre opening activities, including staffing increases, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Management expects pre opening costs to continue to increase as the development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau progress. In 2004, we sold our existing corporate aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in loss on the sale of assets of approximately $643,000. In addition, depreciation expenses increased as a result of the two aircraft purchases. The increased depreciation of approximately $1.2 million for 2004 compared to 2003 and the additional losses on the sale of assets, primarily the former aircraft, are the primary components of the remaining increase in total expenses over the prior year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we benefited from certain significant collections of Desert Inn casino marker receivables totaling approximately $4.2 million. The marker receivables were acquired by us as part of the Desert Inn purchase in June 2000. This gain was used to reduce the carrying value of land in 2004. Other than the marker collections, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 for the future development of a parking facility produced a net loss of approximately $651,000. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately $118.1 million to an expense of approximately $116.8 million from income of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. This loss is attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as part of the refinancing discussed below (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Refinancing), we 53 recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflects the tender price on approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the writeoffs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2004 there was a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense, and an approximately $1.7 million decrease in interest income. Lower interest income is primarily attributable to the decrease in average amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas, while the interest expense decreased due to increased capitalization of interest expense commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas. Comprehensive income decreased from a gain of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, to a gain of approximately $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the increase and decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our two interest rate swaps entered into during the second quarter of 2003 combined with (for 2004 only) the change in the fair value of two new interest rate swaps that we entered into in connection with the refinancing on December 14, 2004. When we refinanced the Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the interest rate swaps associated with our former credit facilities and entered into two new interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. Although we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million on terminating the former swaps, we are amortizing this amount from other comprehensive income into earnings over the original life of the former swap contracts (December 2006). Both our former and our new interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements. Accordingly, changes in the fair value are charged, to the extent the hedge is effective (as defined in the accounting pronouncements), directly to comprehensive income. The fair value approximates the amount we would pay or receive if these contracts were settled at the valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments, and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $48.9 million, a $17.2 million or 54% increase over the net loss of approximately $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due to increased development activities. In 2004, we reclassified the amounts received from certain executive officers for use of our corporate aircraft from revenues into preopening expenses to reflect these amounts as a reduction of the costs to operate our aircraft. These amounts were approximately $375,000, $615,000 and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the period from inception to December 31, 2004. Consequently, all periods presented were reclassified to conform to this presentation. As a result, the aircraft revenue in 2002 reflects third party charter revenue. The corporate aircraft owned by us subsequent to February 2002, when we sold our first corporate aircraft, have not been licensed for charter services. Accordingly, we no longer have third party charter revenues. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, of approximately $643,000 increased approximately $99,000 or 18% from total revenues of approximately $544,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to increased patronage of the art gallery and related retail store. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $19.0 million, or 54%, to $54.0 million, as compared to $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to an approximately $22.2 million or 90% increase in pre opening costs to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $3.2 million from approximately $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in pre opening costs, which consist primarily of salaries and wages, including non recurring employee separation expenses of approximately $1.4 million, and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to an increase in 54 pre opening activities as compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect pre opening costs to continue to increase as development of Wynn Las Vegas, and Wynn Macau pre development activities, progress. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses is a result of most current buildings and improvements becoming fully depreciated in June of 2003. Other income/(expense) net for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased by approximately $507,000 to income of approximately $1.3 million from approximately $1.8 million of income during the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased approximately $7.1 million to approximately $9.0 million or 376% over the interest expense of approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due primarily to the commitment fees related to certain of the unused outstanding debt facilities entered into in October 2002. Offsetting the increase in interest expense is an increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of approximately $6.6 million to approximately $10.3 million or 178% over interest income of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the significant increase in invested cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity. Certain trends that may affect development activities and future results of operations In the near term, our development activities may be impacted by various economic factors, including, among other things, the availability and cost of materials, the availability of labor resources, interest rate levels and, specifically in connection with Wynn Macau, foreign exchange rates and legislative and regulatory issues relating to gaming and taxes. The strength and profitability of our business after our casino resorts open will depend on consumer demand for casino resorts, in general, and for the specific types of luxury amenities that Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau will offer. Adverse changes in consumer preferences, discretionary income and general economic conditions, as well as fears of recession, reduced consumer confidence in the economy, the possibility of continued terrorist activities in the United States and elsewhere, the war in Iraq and other military conflicts in the Middle East, a resurgence of SARS or another infectious disease or a natural disaster such as the Tsunami that struck southeast Asia in December 2004, could reduce customer demand for the products and services we will offer, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources We have financed each of our development projects separately at the subsidiaries that will own and operate them. As of December 31, 2004, we have corporate management and development overhead and two construction projects: Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $330.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. In excess of $300 million of these funds are uncommitted and available for general corporate purposes. In addition, we had approximately $942.4 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. The substantial majority of this amount is restricted for the development and construction of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau, and certain other specific costs in accordance with agreements governing our debt facilities, including but not limited to $698.6 million restricted for the construction, development and preopening expenses of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore, $134.1 million restricted for the development, construction and preopening expenses of Wynn Macau (including a $50.0 million performance bond collateral deposit), $80.0 million restricted for a Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved), approximately $29.7 million restricted for the next four semi annual interest payments through July 15, 2007, on our 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2015 (the Debentures) and small amounts committed for certain sales tax and other deposits. Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Companys debt facilities. 55 Financing for Wynn Las Vegas and Encore As of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.0 billion of the total Wynn Las Vegas project cost, (including the cost of the land, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital, proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of our recently discharged Second Mortgage Notes, and our previous debt facilities. On December 14, 2004, as described in more detail below, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas debt structure and raised the additional funds needed to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the intended expansion of Wynn Las Vegas, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of financial maturity. In addition, it provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets. In May 2004, we amended documents governing our former credit facilities to release from certain development and other restrictions, the approximately 20 acres on which the remaining buildings of the former Desert Inn Resort and Casino then stood, so that the land would be available for what is to become Encore. The land was then used to collateralize a $143.4 million borrowing (the Land Loan) under a credit agreement bearing interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 5.5%. The proceeds of the Land Loan were used to fund a portion of the costs of Wynn Las Vegas and Encore. Later in May 2004, we completed a public offering of seven million shares of our common stock at a price of $38.75 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $268.2 million. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes, as discussed below, and the remaining portion of the net proceeds to help finance Wynn Macau. On June 14, 2004, pursuant to the indenture governing the Second Mortgage Notes, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (collectively, the Issuers), redeemed approximately $122.4 million of the $370 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes outstanding. The total price of the redemption was approximately $138.9 million, equal to 112.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In connection with the redemption, we wrote off approximately $7.0 million of the unamortized original issue discount and approximately $3.9 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes. Accordingly, we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt in the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $25.6 million to reflect the write offs and the $14.7 million redemption premium. In November and December 2004, we completed the sale of 8,625,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $61.00 per share, which, after underwriting discounts and commissions, generated net proceeds of approximately $521.2 million. Of the net proceeds, $400.0 million was directly contributed to the Wynn Las Vegas project. The remaining amounts will be used for general corporate purposes. During 2004, we continued to borrow available amounts under our former credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, we completed a refinancing of our indebtedness whereby the Issuers: Issued $1.3 billion of First Mortgage Notes; Redeemed $237.4 million of the outstanding $247.6 million of Second Mortgage Notes; Repaid the outstanding $143.4 million balance on the Land Loan described above; Repaid the outstanding $250.0 million balance of term loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $208.6 million balance of revolving credit loans under our previous credit facilities; Repaid the outstanding $70.3 million balance of loans under our previous furniture, fixtures and equipment loan facility (the FF& E Facility); 56 Entered into a new $1.0 billion credit facility (See New Credit Facilities, below); Terminated the two former interest rate swap agreements hedging the interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of variable rate borrowings under our previous credit facilities; and Entered into two new interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $400 million of term loan borrowings under the new credit facilities. In connection with this refinancing, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $97.2 million. This loss consists of the Second Mortgage Notes tender premium and associated consent fees of approximately $62.9 million, prepayment penalties on the FF&E Facility of approximately $1.6 million, the writeoff of the tendered portion of the original issue discount relating to the Second Mortgage Notes of approximately $12.6 million and writeoffs of debt issue costs associated with the Second Mortgage Notes and the former debt facilities of approximately $20.1 million. The refinancing lowers our long term interest expense and also provides the financial flexibility for the further development of our real property assets. Also, in connection with the termination of the two former interest rate swaps noted above, we received a cash settlement of approximately $9.6 million. The gain realized from the former swaps is being amortized out of other comprehensive income into earnings through December 2006 (the life of the original swaps). We will fund the costs to complete Wynn Las Vegas (estimated to be approximately $670.0 million at December 31, 2004) pursuant to the Disbursement Agreement, described below (see Disbursement Agreement), that we entered into with the agent for the lenders under the new credit facilities and the trustee under the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes. Under the Disbursement Agreement, we will use funds in the following order of priority: First, by using any cash on hand, including restricted cash available for this purpose, until exhaustion thereof; Second, by using any remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, and the proceeds of borrowings under the new credit facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the new credit facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the new credit facilities; and Fourth, by using the funds made available to us on a gradual basis from the $50 million completion guarantee deposit account and the $30 million liquidity reserve account. We expect to have sufficient funds from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and availability under our new credit facilities to complete construction of Wynn Las Vegas without using any funds from the completion guarantee or liquidity reserve account. Any construction delays or scope changes with respect to Wynn Las Vegas may result in having to utilize these funds or in our borrowing additional funds under the new credit facilities. Through December 31, 2004, we have funded approximately $26.3 million of costs associated with the design and predevelopment of Encore. Until such time as the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have been submitted by us and approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities pursuant to the terms of the disbursement agreement, the new disbursement agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million to pay for development costs for Encore. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are approved by June 30, 2005, then we expect to fund construction of Encore with remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, borrowings under our new credit facilities and future cash flows from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas. We will fund the costs of development and construction of Encore pursuant to the disbursement agreement, with funds utilized in the same order of priority as indicated above for Wynn Las Vegas. If the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications are not approved by June 30, 2005, the amount available under the new credit facilities, and the amount of indebtedness that the indenture for the First Mortgage Notes will permit us to incur for this purpose, will be reduced by $550.0 million. 57 We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. Our two new interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under our new credit facilities in accordance Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). As of December 31, 2004, we recorded approximately $583,000 in other assets to reflect their fair value. The fair value approximates the amount we would receive if these contracts were settled at December 31, 2004. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Financing for Wynn Macau As of December 31, 2004, approximately $123.2 million of the total Wynn Macau project cost, (including the cost of the land payments, capitalized interest, pre opening expenses and all financing fees) had been expended or incurred. This was funded primarily from a combination of our cash on hand from contributed capital and the proceeds from intercompany loans. On September 14, 2004, we completed the financing for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau. Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement or CTA) and related ancillary agreements for a senior secured bank facility of $397.0 million. The senior secured bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of $382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until previously funded base equity (in the form of intercompany loans bearing 6.25% annual interest) of $230.0 million and scheduled subordinated funding (in the form of an intercompany loans bearing interest at 7.5%) of $122.0 million have been expended for the construction and development of Wynn Macau. Commencing on September 14, 2007, the principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments. During the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal is due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.00% of the principal is due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.00% of the principal is due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.00% of the principal is due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal is due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011, with annual interest charged at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) (as denominated) plus 3.5%. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it are charged annual interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%. The loans are secured by a collateral package consisting of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. In addition, certain subsidiaries of Wynn Resorts that are direct or indirect shareholders of Wynn Macau, S.A. have executed a guarantee of the loans and pledged their shares in Wynn Macau, S.A. or upstream intermediate companies, as the case may be, as additional security. Existing cash balances from Wynn Resorts, including amounts spent to date on Wynn Macau and $50 million deposited with Banco National Ultramarino, S.A. (BNU) as collateral for a bank guarantee as discussed further below, provide the $230 million of base equity to Wynn Macau, S.A, required under the financing documents. In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase $122 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the contributions and loans and the subordinated notes must be expended for Wynn Macau project costs prior to borrowing under the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts provided $30 million of contingent funds that is available to pay additional costs of construction, if necessary. 58 The CTA contains capital spending limits and other affirmative and negative covenants, customary for a limited recourse project financing, as well as restrictions on the use of up front premia derived from subconcessions (See Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project below for further information). In September 2004, in connection with the financing of the Wynn Macau project, Wynn Macau, S.A. entered into a Bank Guarantee Reimbursement Agreement with BNU for a guarantee in the amount of 700.0 million patacas (approximately US$87.5 million). This guarantee, which is for the benefit of the Macau government, assures Wynn Macau, S.A.s performance under the casino concession agreement, including the payment of premiums, fines and indemnity for any material failure to perform the concession agreement. To secure the guarantee, Wynn Macau, S.A. has deposited $50.0 million of the $230.0 million base equity funding with BNU, which deposit will be drawn upon by Wynn Macau, S.A. after the remainder of its base equity has been spent. From and after repayment of all indebtedness under the senior bank facilities, Wynn Macau, S.A. is obligated, upon demand by BNU, to promptly repay any claim made on the guarantee by the Macau government. The guarantee is further secured by a second priority security interest in the senior lender collateral package. BNU will be paid an annual fee for the guarantee of not to exceed approximately 12.3 million patacas (approximately US$1.5 million). Expected Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2004 of our expected long term indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Long Term Indebtedness Total Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years First Mortgage Notes $ 1,300.0 $ $ $ $ 1,300.0 Convertible Subordinated Debentures(1) 250.0 250.0 Term Loans(2) 26.6 26.6 Second Mortgage Notes(3) 10.1 10.1 Other Long Term Obligations(4) 14.9 0.8 1.6 1.6 10.9 Total long term indebtedness 1,601.6 0.8 11.7 1.6 1,587.5 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5Years Construction contracts(5) $ 805.9 $ 383.8 $ 422.1 $ $ Wynn Macau senior bank facility(6) 397.0 22.1 97.0 277.9 Term Loans(2) 373.4 373.4 Revolver(7) Employment agreements(8) 91.8 24.3 37.0 9.2 21.3 Leasehold interest in land(9) 37.4 9.5 16.3 11.6 Operating leases 12.3 2.0 1.9 0.7 7.7 Estimated interest payments on long term debt(10) 1,244.7 131.9 280.1 274.8 557.9 Total commercial commitments $ 2,962.5 $ 551.5 $ 779.5 $ 393.3 $ 1,238.2 (1) Represents the full obligation under the Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Debentures are convertible, at the holders option, into a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. 59 (2) As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowed approximately $26.5 million of the available $400.0 million under the Term Loans. We are contractually required to borrow the remaining availability of $373.4 million by March 14, 2005. The Term Loans mature on December 14, 2011. (3) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. (4) Represents approximately $14.7 million owing pursuant to loans for one of our corporate aircraft and an annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The aircraft notes bear interest at 5.67% and require monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in 2011. The annuity bears interest at an annual rate of 8% and requires payment of $5,000 per month until February 2009. (5) Represents obligations under our signed construction contracts with Marnell Corrao, Wadsworth Golf Construction Company, Bomel Construction Company, Inc., Leighton/China State and certain other construction companies in connection with the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau. We expect to satisfy some of the payment obligations under these contracts using amounts borrowed under the long term indebtedness shown above. Construction contracts and other related purchase commitments relating to Wynn Macau exceed the requirement to spend 4.0 billion patacas (approximately $500.0 million) by 2009 and consequently are expected to satisfy this obligation. (6) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior secured bank facility. However, we anticipate that we will borrow the available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macay by the third quarter of 2006. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011. (7) As of December 31, 2004, we have not borrowed any amounts under the Revolver. The $600.0 million available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore. The Revolver matures on December 14, 2009. (8) We have entered into employment agreements with several executive officers, other members of management, and certain key employees. These agreements generally have three to five year terms, typically indicate a base salary with specified annual increases, and often contain provisions for guaranteed bonuses. If we terminate certain executives without cause or if certain executives terminate employment with us for good reason following a change of control (as these terms are defined in the employment contracts), we will pay the executive a separation payment in a lump sum, which typically is equal to the base salary of the remaining term of the employment contract plus foregone bonuses, plus certain other payments. Amounts represent the aggregate contractual salaries and guaranteed bonuses during the periods specified in the agreements. (9) In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for the 20 year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2004, we had 10 semi annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest as specified in the land concession contract. (10) Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments, anticipated LIBOR rates based upon expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected levels of borrowings and the timing of repayments. New Credit Facilities On December 14, 2004, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for secured revolving credit and term loan facilities in the 60 aggregate amount of $1.0 billion. The credit facilities consist of a revolving credit facility (the Revolver) in the amount of $600.0 million and a term loan facility (the Term Loans) in the amount of $400.0 million. The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loans will mature on December 14, 2011. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is required to draw half of the Term Loans by February 14, 2005 and the remaining half of the Term Loans by March 14, 2005. The amount available under the new credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specifications have not been approved by a majority of the arrangers or a majority of the lenders under the New Credit Agreement by June 30, 2005. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, prepayment of loans under the Term Loans, or any combination of the two. For purposes of calculating interest, loans under the new credit facilities will be designated, at the election of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, as Eurodollar Loans or, in certain circumstances, Base Rate Loans. Eurodollar Loans under the Revolver and Term Loans are expected to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% and LIBOR plus 2.125%, respectively. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. Base Rate Loans are expected to bear interest at (a) the greater of (i) the rate most recently announced by Deutsche Bank as its prime rate, or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% per annum; plus (b) a borrowing margin 1.25% or 1.125% under the Revolver and Term Loans, respectively. Interest on Base Rate Loans is payable quarterly in arrears. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for revolving loans will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum for Eurodollar Loans and 0.25% to 1.5% per annum for Base Rate Loans. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will pay, quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, the annual fee that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the revolving credit facility will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio, ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum. For unborrowed amounts under the term loan facility, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects to pay, quarterly in arrears, 1.00% per annum on the daily average of the unborrowed amounts under the Term Loans. Letters of credit issued pursuant to the new credit facilities are expected to accrue fees at the borrowing margins payable on Eurodollar Loans as described above, plus a customary fronting fee. In addition, certain fees will be payable on the closing date to certain lenders and other parties to the New Credit Agreement. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from the net proceeds of all debt offerings (other than those constituting certain permitted debt) and, subject to a reinvestment period, asset sale and insurance or condemnation proceeds, in each case with specified exceptions. After the opening of Wynn Las Vegas or, if Encore qualifies for financing under the Disbursement Agreement, after the opening of Encore, Wynn Las Vegas also will be required to make mandatory repayments of indebtedness under the new credit facilities from specified percentages of excess cash flow, which percentages may decrease and or be eliminated based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio. Mandatory prepayments from asset sales and insurance and condemnation proceeds will be applied to repay the Term Loans and First Mortgage Notes and, in certain events, to repay the Revolver and reduce the revolving credit commitments. Other than with respect to a 1% premium that Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will be required to pay with respect to certain repayments of Term Loans occurring prior to December 14, 2005, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC will have the option to prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness under the new credit facilities at any time without premium or penalty. 61 Disbursement Agreement The Disbursement Agreement sets forth Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs material obligations to complete the Wynn Las Vegas hotel and casino resort and, if applicable, develop, construct and complete Encore (collectively, the Projects) and establishes mechanics for approval of a line item budget and a schedule for the completion of construction of Wynn Las Vegas and, if and when applicable, the construction of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement also establishes the conditions to, and the relative sequencing of, the making of advances and disbursements under the new credit facilities and from the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes, and establishes the obligations of the lenders and the administrative agent under the new credit facilities to advance and disburse, respectively, funds under the new credit facilities and the obligation of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee to release funds from the First Mortgage Notes proceeds account upon satisfaction of such conditions. The Disbursement Agreement also sets forth the mechanics for approving change orders and amendments to the construction budgets and the construction schedules for the Projects. The Disbursement Agreement includes certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that relate to construction of the Projects. Under the Disbursement Agreement, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is permitted to use the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and borrowings under the new credit facilities to pay for costs related to the development, construction, outfitting and opening of the Projects (including financing costs and interest during construction) and, subject to certain limitations, corporate overhead and related costs (collectively, Project Costs). Except as provided in the following paragraph, the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will not be available to pay Project Costs related to Encore until a majority of the arrangers (by number) or a majority of the lenders under the new credit facilities (in consultation with the construction consultant) have approved, among other things, the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications and certain construction related agreements (including certain material construction and design contracts), and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC shall have satisfied certain other conditions precedent relating to Encore. Prior to the approval of the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications, as set forth above, the Disbursement Agreement will permit disbursements of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate from the borrowings under the new credit facilities and the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes to pay for Project Costs related to Encore pursuant to abbreviated disbursement procedures set forth in the Disbursement Agreement. No more than $100.0 million from the proceeds of the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes will be disbursed for application toward Project Costs related to Encore prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Thereafter, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved, the entire amount of the borrowings under the new credit facilities (subject to exceptions for working capital and other purposes, including amounts necessary for final completion of Wynn Las Vegas) and the remaining proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will be available for application toward Project Costs related to Encore in accordance with the Disbursement Agreement. The Disbursement Agreement sets forth the order in which funds from the various sources will be made available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. Wynn Las Vegas, LLC expects that a significant portion of the funds needed to pay Project Costs in respect of Encore will come from Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs operating cash flows after opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs failure to achieve operating cash flows, or obtain other funds, sufficient to fund certain of the Project Costs for Encore would prevent Wynn Las Vegas, LLC from obtaining disbursements and may cause an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement and, as a result, under the Indenture and the Credit Agreement. In order to implement the funding of disbursements, the Disbursement Agreement calls for the maintenance of certain accounts, each of which will, subject to certain exceptions, secure Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes; provided that the secured account holding the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations under the First Mortgage Notes, and the secured account holding the proceeds of the new credit facilities will secure only Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs obligations to the lenders under the new credit facilities. The accounts will include a 62 companys funds account, a notes proceeds account, a bank proceeds account, a disbursement account, a cash management account, a completion guarantee deposit account and a liquidity reserve account. The Disbursement Agreement obligates Wynn Las Vegas, LLC to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Disbursement Agreement, the lenders under the new credit facilities and the First Mortgage Notes Trustee will be entitled to suspend their respective obligations to make any further disbursements under the Disbursement Agreement. Provisions under the Disbursement Agreement can be amended or waived by the agent for the New Credit Facilities (acting under the Credit Agreement) without the consent of the First Mortgage Notes Trustee. The Disbursement Agreement will terminate after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas or, if the Encore Budget, Schedule, Plans and Specifications have been approved and Wynn Las Vegas, LLC has elected to construct it, after final completion of Encore. The Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply to Wynn Las Vegas after final completion of Wynn Las Vegas. Upon termination of the Disbursement Agreement, all amounts remaining in any Disbursement Agreement accounts other than amounts on deposit in the liquidity reserve account will be released to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, and the covenants contained in the Disbursement Agreement will cease to apply. Amounts remaining on deposit in the liquidity reserve account at substantial completion will be available to Wynn Las Vegas, LLC under certain circumstances to pay debt service. Upon satisfaction of certain financial tests, amounts remaining in the liquidity reserve account will be applied to repay the revolving loans under the new credit facilities (without a reduction in revolving loan commitments thereunder). Common Terms Agreement for Macau Project On September 14, 2004, Wynn Macau, S.A. executed a definitive credit agreement (the Common Terms Agreement) and related ancillary agreements for a senior bank facility of US$397.0 million. The senior bank facility consists of term loan facilities in the amount of US$382.0 million (which will be borrowed in a combination of Hong Kong and US dollars) and a revolving working capital facility of HK$117.0 million (approximately US$15.0 million). Proceeds from draws on the term loan facilities will be used for the design, development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau, S.A.s destination resort in Macau (the Project). Except for certain specified funding obligations (described below), the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. As described below, the term loans will not be drawn until base equity of US$230.0 million and the subordinated note funding (described below) have been provided to and expended by Wynn Macau, S.A. on the Project, and the other conditions precedent customary for limited recourse project finance construction loans are satisfied. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on September 14, 2007, such that during the third year of the loan, 3.75% of the principal will be due, during the fourth year of the loan, 10.0% of the principal will be due, during the fifth year of the loan, 27.0% of the principal will be due, during the sixth year of the loan, 29.0% of the principal will be due, and during the seventh year of the loan, 30.25% of the principal will be due. The term loans will mature on September 14, 2011 and bear interest at LIBOR or HIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. The working capital facility will expire on September 14, 2007 and borrowings under it will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5% per annum. Customary fees and expense were paid by Wynn Macau. Wynn Resorts has provided US$230.0 million of equity funding to be applied to Project costs (including amounts spent to date on the Project and the US$50.0 million deposited with BNU and described below). In addition, simultaneously with the loan signing, Wynn Group, Asia, Inc. (Wynn Asia), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Wynn Macau, S.A. pursuant to which Wynn Asia will purchase US$122.0 million in subordinated notes to be issued by Wynn Macau, S.A. The subordinated notes will be secured by a third priority security interest in the collateral package. Proceeds of the equity funding and subordinated notes must be expended for Project costs prior to funding of the term loans. In addition, Wynn Resorts has provided US$30.0 million of contingent equity that is available to pay additional 63 costs of construction. Other than the equity, subordinated funding, contingent equity support and clawbacks of certain restricted payments made during the loan term, the financing is non recourse to Wynn Resorts. Wynn Macau, S.A. is required to make mandatory prepayments of indebtedness under certain circumstances with certain proceeds from equity issuances (at the Wynn Macau, S.A. level), asset sales, eminent domain, excess cash flow, insurance and subconcessions. Additionally, if substantially all of the Project is lost, damaged, destroyed or declared a total loss, the indebtedness may be accelerated. Other Liquidity Matters New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas or other international or domestic markets, whether through acquisition, investment or development. For example, we have submitted a proposal pursuant to a Request for Concept recently solicited by the Singapore government, for an integrated resort development with a casino in that jurisdiction. This or any other development would require us to obtain additional financing, which could be comprised of a combination of debt and equity. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through a line of subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. In addition, Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by the board of directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Furthermore, if completion of the Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening of our respective resorts will increase correspondingly. Following the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we expect Wynn Las Vegas to fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under the new credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the new credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot ensure that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 64 The following table provides information about our long term indebtedness as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Date FaceAmount CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value (in thousands) 6.625% Mortgage Notes December 2014 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,300,000 $ 1,293,500 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures July 2015 250,000 250,000 764,375 Term Loans, interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%, (approximately 4.575% at December 31, 2004) December 2011 26,564 26,564 26,564 12% Second Mortgage Notes(1) November 2010 10,142 9,611 11,359 Note payable airplane; interest at 5.67% September 2011 14,659 14,659 14,659 Note payable land parcel; interest at 8.0% February 2009 212 212 212 $ 1,601,577 $ 1,601,046 $ 2,110,669 (1) On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. The estimated fair value reflects the face value of the Second Mortgage Notes reflected at the 112% redemption price at November 1, 2006). The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2004 on our expected long term indebtedness See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR rate at December 31, 2004 equal to 2.45% is used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 0.7 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1,571.0 $ 1,575.0 Average interest rate 5.81 % 5.81 % 5.82 % 5.82 % 5.70 % 5.67 % 5.70 % Variable rate $ $ $ 22.2 $ 26.3 $ 207.4 $ 651.3 $ 907.2 Average interest rate N/A N/A 2.67 % 2.45 % 3.93 % 3.67 % 3.62 % Consistent with our obligation under our former credit facilities to obtain interest rate protection for at least $325 million of borrowings thereunder, in May 2003 and June 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825 million of our expected future borrowings under our former credit facilities, which bore interest at LIBOR plus 4% and LIBOR plus 5.5%, on the former revolving credit facility and the former term loan facility, respectively, and were to mature in October 2008 and October 2009, respectively. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas debt structure, we terminated the two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset. The balance of $9.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to those interest rate swaps will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the original contract life of the two interest rate swaps. Also concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of our expected future borrowings under our new term 65 loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two new interest rate swap arrangements, we will receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. These effective dates of the two swaps were designed to correspond with the amounts and timing of our expected borrowings under the new term loan facility. The interest rate swaps are expected to be effective as hedging instruments as long as sufficient LIBOR based borrowings are outstanding under the new term loan facility, and effectively fixes the interest rate on borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.918%. Any ineffectiveness will increase our recorded interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two former interest rate swaps of approximately $8.8 million. Because there had been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount was reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we recorded in other assets the fair value of the net effect of the two new interest rate swaps of approximately $583,000. Because there has been no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship, the corresponding change in fair value of equal amount is reported in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2004. The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2004 and using estimated future LIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ 333.3 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ 400.0 $ $ n/a Average pay rate 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.79 % n/a Average receive rate 2.78 % 3.47 % 4.02 % 4.53 % n/a We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we incurred approximately $122.0 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2004 by approximately $2.5 million. Foreign Currency Risks The currency used in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar and the Chinese renminbi to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese renminbi and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current peg rate for these currencies will remain at the same level. Any change in such peg rate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make payments on certain of our debt instruments. 66 Because Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations under the concession agreement are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenue for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Wynn Macau intends to spend any Macau patacas received on local casino operating expenses. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk.
