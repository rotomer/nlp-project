December 31, 2005 and 2004 also includes approximately $9.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, for the current portion of the required contract premium payments under our land concession contract relating to Wynn Macau. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and gives effect to the restatement discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. Wynn Las Vegas, our first resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, opened on April 28, 2005. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we were solely a development stage company. 36 Wynn Las Vegas We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas features: An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book; Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas; Casual and fine dining in 18 outlets featuring signature chefs, including the Five Diamond award winning restaurant, Alex; A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership; Approximately 76,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Brioni, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Jean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik; Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18 hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and full service spa and salon; and Showroom, nightclub and lounge entertainment The resort, which is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In the 248 days since its opening, Wynn Las Vegas generated Net Revenues of $722.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $212.0 million. Net Revenues are comprised of $353.7 million in Net Gaming Revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of Net Non Gaming Revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of the resorts non gaming amenities, combined with the goal of providing guests with an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in Wynn Las Vegas average daily room rates and other non gaming revenues. Consequently, we believe that revenues from Wynn Las Vegas non gaming activities will comprise a higher percentage of total revenues than that of many of its competitors. Since its opening, we have further enhanced and refined Wynn Las Vegas in response to market demands and customer preferences. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we remodeled six of our Fairway Villas, Corsa Cucina, the propertys contemporary Italian restaurant, Tryst, the nightclub formerly known as La B&ecirc;te, and portions of the high limit gaming areas. Improvements and refinements will continue be made throughout 2006. We have agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive run at Wynn Las Vegas at the end of May 2006. We intend to remodel the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas to accommodate Monty Pythons Spamalot winner of the 2005 Tony Award for best musical. We have not yet determined the total costs of remodeling the theater and adjacent areas, nor have we determined the opening date for the new production. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas As a result of the strong demand for the amenities and services offered by Wynn Las Vegas, the continued strength of the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, we intend to develop Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore) on approximately 20 acres on the Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. We have recently refined the design of Encore to feature a 2,054 room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, consisting of 144 suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, in addition to restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and to open Encore to the public by the end of 2008. The project budget for Encore is approximately $1.74 billion, including approximately $70.0 million to be incurred for construction of a new employee parking garage on our Koval property, a related pedestrian bridge and costs to be incurred in connection with preparing the Broadway Theater to host Monty Pythons Spamalot. 37 Wynn Macau We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first destination casino resort in Macau, under a 20 year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. We are one of only three concessionaires and two sub concessionaires currently permitted by the government to operate a casino gaming business in Macau. The government of Macau has expressed its desire to transform Macau into the tourist destination of choice in Asia. The Chinese government has also gradually relaxed its travel and currency restrictions, allowing mainland Chinese from certain urban centers and economically developed areas to visit Macau without joining a tour group and increasing the amount of renminbi that Chinese citizens are permitted to bring into Macau. With approximately 100.0 million people within a three hour drive and nearly 1.0 billion people within a three hour flight from Macau, Wynn Macau is located in what we believe will be one of the largest and fastest growing gaming markets in the world. Wynn Macau is being constructed, and will open, in phases. The first phase of the project will utilize approximately 11 of a total site area of 16 acres of land and includes 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 26,000 square feet of retail space, a spa, a salon, entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. The second phase will include an additional 136,000 square feet of casino space, two restaurants, retail, a theater, and a dramatic front feature attraction. The second phase will be built on the remaining five acres of the Wynn Macau site and will be integrated into the first phase of Wynn Macau. The second phase is expected to be completed and open to the public by the third quarter of 2007. On February 23, 2006, we announced an increase in the capacity of the second phase by the addition of 150 table games. The second phase will now include 300 table games increasing the total table count of Wynn Macau from 350 tables to 500 tables. The addition to the casino in the second phase, along with enhancements to certain of our suites, is expected to cost approximately $70.0 million, bringing the total budget of Wynn Macau to approximately $1.2 billion. Subject to our obtaining all necessary approvals from our secured lenders, the addition to the casino and suite product enhancements will be funded through bank facilities under the existing financing structure. The second phase, including the additional 150 tables, remains on target to open by the third quarter of 2007. Future Growth We have submitted an application for a land concession for an additional 54 acres of land on the Cotai Strip in Macau for future development. We also continue to evaluate additional domestic and international opportunities as they arise. Results of Operations We are currently reliant solely upon the operations of Wynn Las Vegas for our operating cash flow. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, we had not commenced operations, nor generated any significant revenues. Because we have not operated for a full year, we believe that our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not indicative of future results. We incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $90.8 million, which represents a $113.3 million or 56% decrease from the net loss of $204.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and a $50.7 million or 127% increase from the net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 2003. Overall, this reflects the cycle of increasing pre opening expenses as Wynn Las Vegas approached opening. We expect that our pre opening expenses, which were a significant contributor to the net losses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, will decrease in the near term. We will no longer incur pre opening expenses associated with Wynn Las Vegas (excluding Encore). However, pre opening expenses relating to Wynn Macau will increase as the construction of Wynn Macau progresses and as staffing increases prior to opening. In addition, pre opening expenses associated with Encore will increase as development of Encore continues and construction commences. 38 We monitor our operations and evaluate our earnings by reviewing the assets and operations of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau. The following table sets forth our financial results for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, by segment and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (amounts in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues(1) Casino $ 353,663 $ $ Rooms 170,315 Food and beverage 173,700 Entertainment, retail and other 125,230 195 643 Gross revenues 822,908 195 643 Less promotional allowances (100,927 ) Net revenues $ 721,981 $ 195 $ 643 Adjusted EBITDA(1, 2) $ 212,007 $ (208 ) $ (201 ) Other operating costs and expenses Preopening expenses: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (67,454 ) (41,073 ) (18,936 ) Wynn Macau (20,402 ) (15,970 ) (8,382 ) Corporate and other (9,084 ) (24,278 ) (19,426 ) Depreciation and amortization: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (94,297 ) (3,793 ) (2,119 ) Wynn Macau (6,429 ) (1,704 ) Corporate and other (2,618 ) (1,482 ) (3,624 ) Property charges and other: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (14,183 ) (1,290 ) (425 ) Wynn Macau Corporate and other (114 ) (222 ) Corporate expenses and other (21,982 ) Total (236,563 ) (89,590 ) (53,134 ) Operating loss (24,556 ) (89,798 ) (53,335 ) Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income 36,419 10,048 19,138 Interest expense, net (102,699 ) (2,687 ) (9,031 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (122,788 ) Total (66,280 ) (115,427 ) 10,107 Minority interest 1,054 3,129 Net loss $ (90,836 ) $ (204,171 ) $ (40,099 ) (1) Wynn Macau is currently in the development stage and therefore has no revenues or Adjusted EBITDA. (2) Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses, earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates and other non operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the operating performance of its segments Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA 39 because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) financial measures. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded preopening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties from their EBITDA calculations. However, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with the common GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments and taxes, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year have no comparisons to either 2004 or 2003 as we were solely a development stage company prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Revenues Wynn Las Vegas net gaming revenues were $353.7 million for the 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year. During that period, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) was within the expected range of 18% to 22%, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 5% to 6% of handle. For the 248 days of operations in 2005, Wynn Las Vegas gross room revenues were approximately $170.3 million. Average daily rate (ADR) and occupancy for that period were $274 and 92%, respectively, generating revenues per available room (REVPAR) of $253. Other non gaming revenues included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA Wynn Las Vegas Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $212.0 million for the 248 days of operations during 2005. Included in Adjusted EBITDA are direct departmental expenses not present in the corresponding 2004 periods. During 2005, these departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, rooms expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. At opening, Wynn Las Vegas employed approximately 9,200 persons to accommodate increased opening needs. Natural staffing attrition reduced the number of employees at the end of 2005 to approximately 8,900 persons, reflecting a more normalized staffing level. We expect Wynn Las Vegas operating margins to improve, as we benefit from the decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees required to operate the resort and as a result of efficiencies gained through experience with the Wynn Las Vegas resort. Pre opening expenses Wynn Las Vegas pre opening expenses increased by $26.4 million or 64% in 2005 over the prior year. Once it opened for business in April 2005, Wynn Las Vegas no longer incurred pre opening expenses; however, $1.6 million of pre opening expenses relating to Encore are included in the Wynn Las Vegas segment. There also 40 was a substantial increase in staffing immediately preceding the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, which contributed to the increased level of pre opening expenses in 2005. As the Encore development progresses in 2006, we expect associated pre opening expenses to increase. Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses increased by $4.4 million or 28% from 2004 to 2005, due primarily to the increased pre opening activity commensurate with the progress of the resorts construction. We expect that Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses will continue to increase in the first three quarters of 2006 as construction and development continue toward opening, similar to the trend experienced with Wynn Las Vegas in 2005. Corporate and other pre opening expenses were $9.1 million for 2005. After Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, corporate expenses were charged to general and administrative expense instead of pre opening expenses. Consequently, corporate and other pre opening expenses decreased by $15.2 million or 63% from 2004 to 2005. Corporate staffing did not change significantly immediately before or after the opening of Wynn Las Vegas; instead, the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to having a 117 day pre opening period in 2005, compared with a 365 day pre opening period in 2004. Depreciation and amortization Wynn Las Vegas depreciation and amortization expense increased by $90.5 million for 2005 compared to 2004, as a result of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened and these assets were placed into service, we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly. Wynn Macaus depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $4.7 million in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the amortization of the capitalized intangible assets associated with the Macau casino and land concessions. In September 2004, we purchased the 17.5% minority interest in Wynn Macau held by third parties for 1,333,333 shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. We allocated $42.3 million of the value of the shares to the casino concession, which is charged to amortization expense over the concessions term through June 2022. We also obtained a land lease concession during 2004, which we charge to depreciation and amortization over the 25 year term of the lease. Other than these charges to depreciation and amortization, Wynn Macaus depreciation expenses will remain relatively insignificant until the resort opens and its assets are placed into service. Certain assets, primarily a corporate aircraft and certain furniture, fixtures and equipment of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries included in corporate and other, are also depreciated. We purchased the corporate aircraft in 2004 and, thus, 2005 was its first full year of depreciation. In addition, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we began recognizing the depreciation of the furniture, fixtures and equipment in our corporate offices, which are located at Wynn Las Vegas. Property charges and other In response to our evaluation of the finished product and in response to the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the total $14.3 million for Wynn Las Vegas property charges and other for 2005 are approximately $9.4 million of costs relating to assets retired as a result of the remodel efforts at Wynn Las Vegas, and approximately $3.1 million of expenses relating to the abandonment of improvements made to the temporary offices utilized during part of the construction and development of the resort. Once we decided to remodel the Broadway Theater to present Spamalot, we also wrote off approximately $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2005 in connection with the preliminary design and development of a third theater originally planned to house Monty Pythons Spamalot, 41 and later abandoned. There were no comparable Wynn Las Vegas property charges incurred during 2004. Property charges in 2004 instead reflect net losses on ordinary asset sales, including an aircraft sold in 2004 at a loss of approximately $550,000. Corporate expenses and other Corporate expenses reflect costs such as salaries and other general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, corporate expenses were reported as pre opening expenses. Consequently, the corporate expenses of approximately $22.0 million in 2005 represent such unallocated expenses incurred in the 248 days of operations in 2005. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income increased by $26.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings supplemented by the use of derivative financial instruments as required or considered necessary. We were required to, and did obtain through interest rate swap arrangements, interest rate protection for portions of our borrowings under our credit facilities. These interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). The financial information shown above reflects approximately $8.1 million of income resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The remaining increase of approximately $18.2 million is due primarily to the significant increase in the amount of average cash balances available and invested from the remaining proceeds of our 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes) and borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities that were invested during 2005, compared to 2004. Interest expense, net, increased by $100.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the significant decrease in the amount of interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas opened, plus the increase in the long term debt principal resulting from our December 2004 refinancing and credit facility borrowings during 2005. Also during 2004, we recorded a $122.8 million loss on the early retirement of the majority of the original $370.0 million of 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes). This loss resulted from the write off of associated deferred financing costs and original issue discount, as well as a 12% redemption premium, on the Second Mortgage Notes. We intend to repurchase the remaining principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes totaling approximately $10.1 million on November 1, 2006 (the first available call date), at which time an additional loss will have to be recorded to reflect the redemption premium and any write off of remaining financing costs. The necessary amounts to call the Second Mortgage Notes, including interest, have been placed in escrow in anticipation of this event. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the 2004 fiscal year of approximately $204.2 million, a 409% increase over the net loss of approximately $40.1 million for the 2003 fiscal year, due to increased development activities (such as increased staffing) and financing activities (such as the loss on early retirement of debt). Revenues Our minimal revenues for the 2004 fiscal year decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004. 42 Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA remained a small comparable loss between 2004 and 2003. Although the revenues from the art gallery were reduced, costs to operate the art gallery were similarly reduced, thus not significantly affecting the total net results. Pre opening expenses Wynn Las Vegas pre opening expenses increased by $22.1 million or 117% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre opening expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to the increase in pre opening activities, including staffing increases, during 2004 as compared to 2003. Wynn Macau pre opening expenses increased by $7.6 million or 91% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre opening expenses directly correlates to the increased pre opening activities for Wynn Macau as the project progressed during 2004 as compared to 2003. Corporate and other pre opening expenses increased by $4.9 million or 25% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in corporate pre opening expenses directly correlates with the increased pre opening activities for both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau as these projects progressed during 2004 as compared to 2003. Depreciation and amortization Wynn Las Vegas depreciation and amortization increased by $1.7 million or 79% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of purchasing an aircraft in 2004, for which we then began recognizing depreciation. Wynn Macaus depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $1.7 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily resulting from the amortization of the Macau gaming concession asset, which increased from 2003 to correspond to the increase in asset value, due to the purchase price allocation following the acquisition of the minority interest previously held by third parties in September of 2004, and the amortization of the leasehold interest in land acquired as part of the land concession agreement entered into in June 2004. Corporate and other depreciation and amortization decreased by $2.1 million or 59% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of fully depreciating the remaining assets purchased from the Desert Inn Resort and Casino, including the parking garage, in June 2003. Property charges and other In 2004, we sold our existing aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in property charges compared to 2003. In addition, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income, plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 (for the subsequent development of a parking facility across Sands Avenue from Wynn Las Vegas), produced an additional increase in the property charges for 2004 compared to 2003. Other non operating costs and expenses Other income (expense), net for 2004, decreased approximately $125.5 million to an expense of approximately $115.4 million from income of approximately $10.1 million for 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. The loss was attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as part of the refinancing of Wynn Las 43 Vegas, we recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflected the tender price on approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the write offs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Also during 2004, there was an approximately $9.1 million decrease in interest income and a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense. Lower interest income was primarily attributable to the decrease in average amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas offset by approximately $1.4 million of interest rate swap fair market value increases, while the interest expense decreased due to increased capitalization of interest commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operations Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income, interest paid, and non cash charges included in operating income. During 2003 and 2004, we were solely a development stage company without material operations. During those periods, net cash used in operations was $21.8 million and $114.8 million, respectively. On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating cash from operations. Net cash from operations in 2005 was $48.5 million. Because 2005 did not include a full year of operations and because significant pre opening expenses were incurred during 2005, we believe that cash flows from operations for 2005 are not indicative of future results. Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $434.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available for use without restriction, including for new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas, or to support the development and construction of Wynn Macau and Encore. Of this, approximately $308.0 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of either Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs or Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt, and therefore is not obligated to apply any of its funds to either Encore or Wynn Macau. We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Otherwise we attempt to minimize the amount of cash held in banks. Accordingly, excess funds are swept from accounts into overnight investments or to repay borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $442.6 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. Of this amount, approximately $394.8 million is restricted for the remaining costs of Wynn Las Vegas and the construction, development and pre opening expenses of Encore, including $80.0 million restricted for the Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the budget, plans and specifications for Encore (the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs) are approved); approximately $31.8 million is restricted for the ongoing development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau; and approximately $15.0 million is restricted for two semi annual interest payments on our 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 (the Convertible Debentures), $7.5 million of which was paid on January 15, 2006, with the remaining $7.5 million due and payable on July 15, 2006. In addition, there is approximately $1.0 million restricted for certain sales tax and other payments. Cash equivalents include investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Companys debt facilities. Construction and Development Wynn Las Vegas Wynn Las Vegas, except for one of its two theaters, opened on April 28, 2005. The total Wynn Las Vegas project cost (excluding Encore other than the land for Encore) was approximately $2.74 billion. This includes 44 land acquisition costs, design and construction costs, financing fees, interest and other pre opening expenses. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $18.9 million of budgeted project costs and retention amounts remained to be paid in order to close out the project. We expect these final costs to be paid in the second quarter of 2006. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, we were permitted to make up to $40.0 million of capital expenditures in 2005, of which we actually expended $37.9 million. In 2006, we will be permitted to make up to $80.0 million of capital expenditures at Wynn Las Vegas. These spending limits are increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas On March 15, 2006, we submitted the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs to our lenders for approval. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006, and open it to the public by the end of 2008. Wynn Macau In June 2004, we began construction of Wynn Macau. Design and construction is progressing on schedule and within budget. Superstructure works are complete for the podium and tower. Certain areas in the first phase of the project, namely retail and the information technology data center, have been handed over to operations. Final design work on the second phase has largely been completed and construction work on the second phase is rapidly moving from the foundations to the structure. Construction milestones since groundbreaking include the following: Phase I All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities; The foundation pile cap construction and underground drainage are complete; The highrise building superstructure, roof placement and signature swoosh are complete; The parking garage is complete; The lowrise podium superstructure is complete; Interior work continues in the lowrise podium areas such as the casino and ballrooms; and Installation of central plant and equipment, including generators, boilers, chillers and cooling towers, continues. Phase II (expansion) All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities; Design is progressing; consultancy agreements have been awarded and interior design concepts are being developed; Piling is complete and pile cap activities are underway; Deep excavation for the front feature has been completed; Basement tunnels and corridors have been completed; and Plans for an expanded casino have been finalized. 45 The current total project budget for Wynn Macau (including the approximately $70.0 million expansion of the second phase and suite enhancements) is approximately $1.2 billion, including contingencies, but excluding up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Under the amended and restated construction contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be designed by one of our subsidiaries) based on an existing scope of work and design specifications for both the first phase and the expansion as provided by us, for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $457.2 million (including the contractors fee and contingency). We expect that the guaranteed maximum price will be increased by approximately $23.0 million to reflect addition of the casino expansion to the second phase of Wynn Macau. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has incurred approximately $427.2 million of a total $1.2 billion project budget. Approximately $748.4 million remains to be spent to complete Wynn Macau. Financing Activities Wynn Las Vegas and Encore On December 14, 2004, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs debt structure and provided the additional funds to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the development of Encore, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of financial maturity. In addition, the refinancing provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets. Although a final accounting for Wynn Las Vegas is not expected until the second quarter of 2006, Wynn Las Vegas estimated $2.74 billion total project cost has been, and will be, funded from a combination of contributed capital from the original shareholders of Valvino Lamore, LLC (the predecessor of Wynn Resorts), proceeds from sales of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of the Second Mortgage Notes (which were discharged in connection with the December 2004 refinancing), proceeds from the issuance of First Mortgage Notes, and a portion of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs $1.0 billion credit facilities (the Credit Facilities), which consist of a $400 million term loan facility (the Term Loan) and a $600 million revolving facility (the Revolver). The Revolver is available for Wynn Las Vegas general corporate purposes and for Encore, and any amounts repaid may be re borrowed. In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed $80.0 million under the Revolver and loaned it to Wynn Macau, S.A. as subordinated debt. This borrowing was repaid by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in the third quarter of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, $10.0 million has been borrowed and remains outstanding under the Revolver. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities have been and are expected to continue to be, designated by us as Eurodollar Loans. These Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.25% for the Revolver loans and LIBOR plus 2.125%, for the Term Loans. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. After the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for Eurodollar revolving loans will range from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum depending on Wynn Las Vegas leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the Revolver. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Revolver will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio and will range from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum. The Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations and guarantees are secured by: (1) a first priority security interest on a $30.0 million liquidity reserve account; (2) a $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account held by Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC; (3) the remaining previously funded proceeds of the 46 Credit Facilities; (4) a first priority pledge of all members interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC) and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLCs 100% members interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (5) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf course and Encore; and (6) a first priority security interest in substantially all other existing and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding a corporate aircraft owned by World Travel, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loan will mature on December 14, 2011. The amount available under Credit Facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved by March 31, 2006. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, required prepayment of term loans, or any combination of the two. Until the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved, the availability of notes proceeds and funds under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit agreement for this project is limited to $100.0 million, of which we have spent approximately $40.7 million through December 31, 2005. We expect to receive approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs by March 31, 2006. However, if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved, the available borrowings under our Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million. We expect that the available remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, together with availability under the credit facilities, and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion will be funded by the issuance of up to $100.0 million of additional notes and or contributions from Wynn Resorts. We expect to open Encore by the end of 2008. On March 15, 2006, we amended our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities to (a) allow the Company to issue up to $100.0 million of additional First Mortgage Notes; (b) simplify draw procedures under the Disbursement Agreement; (c) consolidate certain accounts under the Disbursement Agreement; (d) amend and clarify certain of the conditions for the Phase II Approval Date; (e) extend the outside opening date for Encore and the outside completion date for Encore to June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively and (f) permit expenditures of up to $150.0 million on Encore prior to the execution of a guaranteed maximum price contract. The final costs of Wynn Las Vegas will be paid from previously funded amounts under the First Mortgage Notes and the Term Loan and the ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority: First, by using agreed excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts; Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Credit Facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and Fourth, by using the funds from the $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account. In December 2004, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Credit Facilities. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 47 Wynn Macau Financing for Wynn Macaus design, development, construction and pre opening expenses is provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of base equity loans totaling $230 million, subordinated loan financing (provided from funds borrowed under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC revolving credit facility) totaling $80 million, and a senior secured credit facility. On September 14, 2005, we amended the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility to expand its availability from $397 million to $764 million, to currently include $729 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156 million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2005, we have borrowed approximately $78.9 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility. The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans will bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin of 3.0% until the opening of Wynn Macau (expected in the third quarter of 2006), at which time the interest rate will reduce to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A. satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%. Collateral for the senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. We began to draw under the Senior Secured Facilities in October 2005, after expenditure of the base equity and subordinated funding. Through December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $427.2 million of the total $1.2 billion of budgeted project costs. Total budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) of approximately $688.0 million, land acquisition costs of approximately $49.0 million, the additional casino expansion of approximately $70.0 million and capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and other costs totaling in the aggregate approximately $368.6 million. These costs have been, and will continue to be, paid from the previously funded $230.0 million base equity and loans from Wynn Resorts and $80.0 million borrowed under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs revolving credit agreement and loaned as subordinated debt, as well as Wynn Macau, S.A.s $764.0 million senior secured credit facility and cash flows from operations once Wynn Macau opens. As of December 31, 2005, project costs still to be incurred totaled approximately $748.4 million. In addition to the above financing sources, we have $30.0 million (plus $1.8 million of accumulated interest earnings) of long term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity and a $72.0 million contingent debt facility available for Wynn Macau. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in October 2005 to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau, S.A. credit facilities. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Other In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $44.75 million secured by a corporate aircraft. The loans mature on May 24, 2010. Principal and interest is payable quarterly, and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, we are required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft occur. Beginning December 31, 2006, we may prepay all or any portion of the loans, subject to a minimum prepayment of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $43.5 million was outstanding under this borrowing. Expected Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2005 of our expected long term 48 indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Long Term Indebtedness Total Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years First Mortgage Notes $ 1,300.0 $ $ $ $ 1,300.0 Convertible Subordinated Debentures[1] 250.0 250.0 Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities[2] 410.0 10.0 400.0 Macau Senior Credit Facilities[3] 79.0 17.3 44.9 16.8 Second Mortgage Notes[4] 10.1 10.1 Other Long Term Obligations[5] 57.7 5.8 12.6 29.3 10.0 Total long term indebtedness $ 2,106.8 $ 15.9 $ 29.9 $ 84.2 $ 1,976.8 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years Construction contracts and commitments $ 348.1 $ 208.4 $ 139.7 $ $ Employment agreements 103.6 31.9 41.9 10.9 18.9 Leasehold interest in land[6] 30.0 9.6 14.2 6.2 Operating leases 19.1 3.8 4.1 3.7 7.5 Estimated interest payments on long term debt[7] 1,170.2 148.5 290.6 285.0 446.0 Total commercial commitments $ 1,671.0 $ 402.2 $ 490.5 $ 305.8 $ 472.4 [1] Represents the full obligation under the Convertible Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Convertible Debentures are convertible, at the holders option, into a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 through the filing of this report, approximately $3.8 million of the Convertible Debentures were converted into common stock. [2] As of December 31, 2005, we had $400.0 million of Term Loans outstanding and $10.0 million outstanding under the Revolver, which mature on December 14, 2011 and December 14, 2009, respectively. The $590.0 million remaining available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore. [3] As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowed approximately $79.0 million under Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior credit facilities. We anticipate that we will borrow the remaining available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macau and its expansion by the third quarter of 2007. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011. [4] On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. [5] Represents the $43.5 million outstanding of the $44.75 million original term loan borrowing secured by a corporate aircraft bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.375%; $13.3 million remaining outstanding on a 5.67% note payable pursuant to a loan to finance our other corporate aircraft; and the remaining amount of an 8% annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The $43.5 million aircraft loan requires quarterly amortizing principal and interest payments and matures on May 24, 2010; the $13.3 million aircraft loan notes requires monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in 2011; and the annuity requires payments of $5,000 per month until February 2009. 49 [6] In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for a 25 year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2005, we had 8 semi annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest, as specified in the land concession contract. [7] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments and anticipated LIBOR rates based upon expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected timing of repayments. Other Liquidity Matters Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the Indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; provided that the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales. If completion of Encore or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions 50 integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates During the construction and development of a resort, pre opening or start up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas, significant start up costs were incurred and charged to pre opening expenses through the second quarter of 2005, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened to the public, expenses associated with the opening of the resort were no longer charged as pre opening expenses. However, start up costs relating to the Encore and Wynn Macau projects will continue to be charged to pre opening expenses. During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets. Depreciation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets as follows: Buildings and improvements 10 to 45 years Land improvements 10 to 45 years Airplanes 7 to 20 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 to 20 years The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed. A charge resulting from a change in the estimated period of benefit is accounted for in the period of change as a change in accounting estimate under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 20, Accounting Changes. Our leasehold interest in the land leased in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, will commence in the third quarter of 2006, when Wynn Macau opens. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau will be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Costs of building repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss. We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the 51 undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Macau. We account for income taxes according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carry forwards and certain temporary differences. The standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses which, among other things, generated significant deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2005, we had $199.9 million of deferred tax assets and $99.7 million of deferred tax liabilities. At this time, because of our limited operating history, we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. If these net deferred tax assets become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109, we intend to appropriately reduce the deferred tax asset reserves. Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable We evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2005, approximately 70% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries. As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy or legal system occur. Derivative Financial Instruments We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. Significant Judgmental Accruals We estimate liabilities for certain self insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of 52 these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement, according to SEC rule, as amended, on January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and the Black Scholes valuation model. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulleting (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and will therefore impact our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). We estimate that the expensing of stock options will reduce our net income for 2006 by approximately $12.8 million (or $0.13 per share) for the unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2005. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, for a description of other recently issued accounting pronouncements, which are relevant to the Company but which we believe will not have a material impact on the Company. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Risks Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 53 The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2005 on our expected long term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2005 of 4.37875% and 4.11045%, respectively are used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 10.9 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1,560.0 $ 1,574.2 Average interest rate 11.53 % 5.82 % 5.73 % 5.67 % 5.67 % 6.51 % 6.66 % Variable rate $ 5.0 $ 5.3 $ 22.9 $ 37.0 $ 45.6 $ 416.8 $ 532.6 Average interest rate 7.31 % 7.37 % 7.68 % 7.62 % 7.82 % 7.20 % 7.31 % Interest Rate Swap Information In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of its floating rate debt facilities, and accounts for these swaps under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), and its related interpretations. Wynn Las Vegas swaps During 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of borrowings under our previous Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs debt structure, we terminated these two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash payment of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset. Concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two interest rate swap arrangements, we receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. Although these interest rate swaps are highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on these borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.9%, changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are, and will continue to be, recorded as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Wynn Macau On October 14, 2005, we entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on future borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under the first swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.3 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008. These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar and 50% of the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.84% and 54 7.77%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Summary of Historical Fair Values The following table presents the historical asset or (liability) fair values (reflected in deposits and other assets or in other long term liabilities as appropriate) at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and as of the December 14, 2004 termination date of the previous Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swaps (amounts in thousands): WynnLas VegasPreviousInterestRate Swaps WynnLas VegasCurrentInterestRate Swaps WynnMacauInterestRate Swaps TotalInterestRate SwapAsset/(Liability) Asset / (liability) fair value: at December 31, 2005 $ $ 10,523 $ (1,788 ) $ 8,735 at December 31, 2004 $ $ 583 $ $ 583 at December 14, 2004 settlement $ 9,625 $ $ $ 9,625 at December 31, 2003 $ 8,793 $ $ $ 8,793 The fair value approximates the amount the Company would receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Other Interest Rate Swap Information The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2005 and using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ 651.7 $ 739.3 $ 739.3 $ $ $ n/a Average pay rate 4.17 % 4.26 % 4.24 % n/a Average receive rate 4.88 % 4.93 % 4.87 % n/a We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity For the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $149.5 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2005 by approximately $700,000. Foreign Currency Risks The currency delineated in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. 55 However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In July 2005, officials from the Peoples Bank of China announced the adoption of a new foreign exchange policy that will move away from a U.S. dollar peg of 8.28 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. The renminbi will instead trade based on a basket of currencies. The currency components of the basket have not been announced. The exchange rate at September 30, 2005, was 8.11 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. Management believes that the current revaluation of the renminibi will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level. Because many of Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and gives effect to the restatement discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Overview We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. Wynn Las Vegas, our first resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, opened on April 28, 2005. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we were solely a development stage company. 36 Wynn Las Vegas We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas features: An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book; Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas; Casual and fine dining in 18 outlets featuring signature chefs, including the Five Diamond award winning restaurant, Alex; A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership; Approximately 76,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Brioni, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Jean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik; Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18 hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and full service spa and salon; and Showroom, nightclub and lounge entertainment The resort, which is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In the 248 days since its opening, Wynn Las Vegas generated Net Revenues of $722.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $212.0 million. Net Revenues are comprised of $353.7 million in Net Gaming Revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of Net Non Gaming Revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of the resorts non gaming amenities, combined with the goal of providing guests with an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in Wynn Las Vegas average daily room rates and other non gaming revenues. Consequently, we believe that revenues from Wynn Las Vegas non gaming activities will comprise a higher percentage of total revenues than that of many of its competitors. Since its opening, we have further enhanced and refined Wynn Las Vegas in response to market demands and customer preferences. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we remodeled six of our Fairway Villas, Corsa Cucina, the propertys contemporary Italian restaurant, Tryst, the nightclub formerly known as La B&ecirc;te, and portions of the high limit gaming areas. Improvements and refinements will continue be made throughout 2006. We have agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive run at Wynn Las Vegas at the end of May 2006. We intend to remodel the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas to accommodate Monty Pythons Spamalot winner of the 2005 Tony Award for best musical. We have not yet determined the total costs of remodeling the theater and adjacent areas, nor have we determined the opening date for the new production. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas As a result of the strong demand for the amenities and services offered by Wynn Las Vegas, the continued strength of the Las Vegas market, and our desire to maximize the potential of our substantial real estate assets, we intend to develop Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore) on approximately 20 acres on the Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. We have recently refined the design of Encore to feature a 2,054 room hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, consisting of 144 suites and 1,910 guest rooms, as well as an approximately 44,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, in addition to restaurants, nightclubs, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006 and to open Encore to the public by the end of 2008. The project budget for Encore is approximately $1.74 billion, including approximately $70.0 million to be incurred for construction of a new employee parking garage on our Koval property, a related pedestrian bridge and costs to be incurred in connection with preparing the Broadway Theater to host Monty Pythons Spamalot. 37 Wynn Macau We are constructing and will own and operate Wynn Macau, our first destination casino resort in Macau, under a 20 year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. We are one of only three concessionaires and two sub concessionaires currently permitted by the government to operate a casino gaming business in Macau. The government of Macau has expressed its desire to transform Macau into the tourist destination of choice in Asia. The Chinese government has also gradually relaxed its travel and currency restrictions, allowing mainland Chinese from certain urban centers and economically developed areas to visit Macau without joining a tour group and increasing the amount of renminbi that Chinese citizens are permitted to bring into Macau. With approximately 100.0 million people within a three hour drive and nearly 1.0 billion people within a three hour flight from Macau, Wynn Macau is located in what we believe will be one of the largest and fastest growing gaming markets in the world. Wynn Macau is being constructed, and will open, in phases. The first phase of the project will utilize approximately 11 of a total site area of 16 acres of land and includes 600 hotel rooms and suites, approximately 100,000 square feet of casino gaming space, seven restaurants, approximately 26,000 square feet of retail space, a spa, a salon, entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. The second phase will include an additional 136,000 square feet of casino space, two restaurants, retail, a theater, and a dramatic front feature attraction. The second phase will be built on the remaining five acres of the Wynn Macau site and will be integrated into the first phase of Wynn Macau. The second phase is expected to be completed and open to the public by the third quarter of 2007. On February 23, 2006, we announced an increase in the capacity of the second phase by the addition of 150 table games. The second phase will now include 300 table games increasing the total table count of Wynn Macau from 350 tables to 500 tables. The addition to the casino in the second phase, along with enhancements to certain of our suites, is expected to cost approximately $70.0 million, bringing the total budget of Wynn Macau to approximately $1.2 billion. Subject to our obtaining all necessary approvals from our secured lenders, the addition to the casino and suite product enhancements will be funded through bank facilities under the existing financing structure. The second phase, including the additional 150 tables, remains on target to open by the third quarter of 2007. Future Growth We have submitted an application for a land concession for an additional 54 acres of land on the Cotai Strip in Macau for future development. We also continue to evaluate additional domestic and international opportunities as they arise. Results of Operations We are currently reliant solely upon the operations of Wynn Las Vegas for our operating cash flow. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, we had not commenced operations, nor generated any significant revenues. Because we have not operated for a full year, we believe that our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are not indicative of future results. We incurred a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $90.8 million, which represents a $113.3 million or 56% decrease from the net loss of $204.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and a $50.7 million or 127% increase from the net loss incurred for the year ended December 31, 2003. Overall, this reflects the cycle of increasing pre opening expenses as Wynn Las Vegas approached opening. We expect that our pre opening expenses, which were a significant contributor to the net losses incurred for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, will decrease in the near term. We will no longer incur pre opening expenses associated with Wynn Las Vegas (excluding Encore). However, pre opening expenses relating to Wynn Macau will increase as the construction of Wynn Macau progresses and as staffing increases prior to opening. In addition, pre opening expenses associated with Encore will increase as development of Encore continues and construction commences. 38 We monitor our operations and evaluate our earnings by reviewing the assets and operations of Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) and Wynn Macau. The following table sets forth our financial results for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003, by segment and reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net loss (amounts in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues(1) Casino $ 353,663 $ $ Rooms 170,315 Food and beverage 173,700 Entertainment, retail and other 125,230 195 643 Gross revenues 822,908 195 643 Less promotional allowances (100,927 ) Net revenues $ 721,981 $ 195 $ 643 Adjusted EBITDA(1, 2) $ 212,007 $ (208 ) $ (201 ) Other operating costs and expenses Preopening expenses: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (67,454 ) (41,073 ) (18,936 ) Wynn Macau (20,402 ) (15,970 ) (8,382 ) Corporate and other (9,084 ) (24,278 ) (19,426 ) Depreciation and amortization: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (94,297 ) (3,793 ) (2,119 ) Wynn Macau (6,429 ) (1,704 ) Corporate and other (2,618 ) (1,482 ) (3,624 ) Property charges and other: Wynn Las Vegas (including Encore) (14,183 ) (1,290 ) (425 ) Wynn Macau Corporate and other (114 ) (222 ) Corporate expenses and other (21,982 ) Total (236,563 ) (89,590 ) (53,134 ) Operating loss (24,556 ) (89,798 ) (53,335 ) Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income 36,419 10,048 19,138 Interest expense, net (102,699 ) (2,687 ) (9,031 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (122,788 ) Total (66,280 ) (115,427 ) 10,107 Minority interest 1,054 3,129 Net loss $ (90,836 ) $ (204,171 ) $ (40,099 ) (1) Wynn Macau is currently in the development stage and therefore has no revenues or Adjusted EBITDA. (2) Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses, earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates and other non operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of the operating performance of its segments Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA 39 because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a companys ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) financial measures. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded preopening expenses, property charges and corporate expenses, which do not relate to the management of specific casino properties from their EBITDA calculations. However, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Companys performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as only one of several comparative tools, together with the common GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments and taxes, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year have no comparisons to either 2004 or 2003 as we were solely a development stage company prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Revenues Wynn Las Vegas net gaming revenues were $353.7 million for the 248 days of operations during the 2005 fiscal year. During that period, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) was within the expected range of 18% to 22%, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 5% to 6% of handle. For the 248 days of operations in 2005, Wynn Las Vegas gross room revenues were approximately $170.3 million. Average daily rate (ADR) and occupancy for that period were $274 and 92%, respectively, generating revenues per available room (REVPAR) of $253. Other non gaming revenues included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA Wynn Las Vegas Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $212.0 million for the 248 days of operations during 2005. Included in Adjusted EBITDA are direct departmental expenses not present in the corresponding 2004 periods. During 2005, these departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, rooms expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. At opening, Wynn Las Vegas employed approximately 9,200 persons to accommodate increased opening needs. Natural staffing attrition reduced the number of employees at the end of 2005 to approximately 8,900 persons, reflecting a more normalized staffing level. We expect Wynn Las Vegas operating margins to improve, as we benefit from the decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees required to operate the resort and as a result of efficiencies gained through experience with the Wynn Las Vegas resort. Pre opening expenses Wynn Las Vegas pre opening expenses increased by $26.4 million or 64% in 2005 over the prior year. Once it opened for business in April 2005, Wynn Las Vegas no longer incurred pre opening expenses; however, $1.6 million of pre opening expenses relating to Encore are included in the Wynn Las Vegas segment. There also 40 was a substantial increase in staffing immediately preceding the opening of Wynn Las Vegas, which contributed to the increased level of pre opening expenses in 2005. As the Encore development progresses in 2006, we expect associated pre opening expenses to increase. Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses increased by $4.4 million or 28% from 2004 to 2005, due primarily to the increased pre opening activity commensurate with the progress of the resorts construction. We expect that Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses will continue to increase in the first three quarters of 2006 as construction and development continue toward opening, similar to the trend experienced with Wynn Las Vegas in 2005. Corporate and other pre opening expenses were $9.1 million for 2005. After Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, corporate expenses were charged to general and administrative expense instead of pre opening expenses. Consequently, corporate and other pre opening expenses decreased by $15.2 million or 63% from 2004 to 2005. Corporate staffing did not change significantly immediately before or after the opening of Wynn Las Vegas; instead, the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to having a 117 day pre opening period in 2005, compared with a 365 day pre opening period in 2004. Depreciation and amortization Wynn Las Vegas depreciation and amortization expense increased by $90.5 million for 2005 compared to 2004, as a result of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened and these assets were placed into service, we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly. Wynn Macaus depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $4.7 million in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the amortization of the capitalized intangible assets associated with the Macau casino and land concessions. In September 2004, we purchased the 17.5% minority interest in Wynn Macau held by third parties for 1,333,333 shares of Wynn Resorts common stock. We allocated $42.3 million of the value of the shares to the casino concession, which is charged to amortization expense over the concessions term through June 2022. We also obtained a land lease concession during 2004, which we charge to depreciation and amortization over the 25 year term of the lease. Other than these charges to depreciation and amortization, Wynn Macaus depreciation expenses will remain relatively insignificant until the resort opens and its assets are placed into service. Certain assets, primarily a corporate aircraft and certain furniture, fixtures and equipment of Wynn Resorts and its subsidiaries included in corporate and other, are also depreciated. We purchased the corporate aircraft in 2004 and, thus, 2005 was its first full year of depreciation. In addition, when we opened Wynn Las Vegas, we began recognizing the depreciation of the furniture, fixtures and equipment in our corporate offices, which are located at Wynn Las Vegas. Property charges and other In response to our evaluation of the finished product and in response to the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the total $14.3 million for Wynn Las Vegas property charges and other for 2005 are approximately $9.4 million of costs relating to assets retired as a result of the remodel efforts at Wynn Las Vegas, and approximately $3.1 million of expenses relating to the abandonment of improvements made to the temporary offices utilized during part of the construction and development of the resort. Once we decided to remodel the Broadway Theater to present Spamalot, we also wrote off approximately $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2005 in connection with the preliminary design and development of a third theater originally planned to house Monty Pythons Spamalot, 41 and later abandoned. There were no comparable Wynn Las Vegas property charges incurred during 2004. Property charges in 2004 instead reflect net losses on ordinary asset sales, including an aircraft sold in 2004 at a loss of approximately $550,000. Corporate expenses and other Corporate expenses reflect costs such as salaries and other general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau. Prior to opening Wynn Las Vegas, corporate expenses were reported as pre opening expenses. Consequently, the corporate expenses of approximately $22.0 million in 2005 represent such unallocated expenses incurred in the 248 days of operations in 2005. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income increased by $26.4 million for 2005 compared to 2004. We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings supplemented by the use of derivative financial instruments as required or considered necessary. We were required to, and did obtain through interest rate swap arrangements, interest rate protection for portions of our borrowings under our credit facilities. These interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). The financial information shown above reflects approximately $8.1 million of income resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. The remaining increase of approximately $18.2 million is due primarily to the significant increase in the amount of average cash balances available and invested from the remaining proceeds of our 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes) and borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities that were invested during 2005, compared to 2004. Interest expense, net, increased by $100.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the significant decrease in the amount of interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas opened, plus the increase in the long term debt principal resulting from our December 2004 refinancing and credit facility borrowings during 2005. Also during 2004, we recorded a $122.8 million loss on the early retirement of the majority of the original $370.0 million of 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes). This loss resulted from the write off of associated deferred financing costs and original issue discount, as well as a 12% redemption premium, on the Second Mortgage Notes. We intend to repurchase the remaining principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes totaling approximately $10.1 million on November 1, 2006 (the first available call date), at which time an additional loss will have to be recorded to reflect the redemption premium and any write off of remaining financing costs. The necessary amounts to call the Second Mortgage Notes, including interest, have been placed in escrow in anticipation of this event. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our development operations resulted in a net loss for the 2004 fiscal year of approximately $204.2 million, a 409% increase over the net loss of approximately $40.1 million for the 2003 fiscal year, due to increased development activities (such as increased staffing) and financing activities (such as the loss on early retirement of debt). Revenues Our minimal revenues for the 2004 fiscal year decreased compared to 2003, primarily as a result of the closure of the art gallery and its related retail shop on May 6, 2004. 42 Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA remained a small comparable loss between 2004 and 2003. Although the revenues from the art gallery were reduced, costs to operate the art gallery were similarly reduced, thus not significantly affecting the total net results. Pre opening expenses Wynn Las Vegas pre opening expenses increased by $22.1 million or 117% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre opening expenses, which consist primarily of salaries and wages and consulting and legal fees, is directly attributable to the increase in pre opening activities, including staffing increases, during 2004 as compared to 2003. Wynn Macau pre opening expenses increased by $7.6 million or 91% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in pre opening expenses directly correlates to the increased pre opening activities for Wynn Macau as the project progressed during 2004 as compared to 2003. Corporate and other pre opening expenses increased by $4.9 million or 25% for 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in corporate pre opening expenses directly correlates with the increased pre opening activities for both Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau as these projects progressed during 2004 as compared to 2003. Depreciation and amortization Wynn Las Vegas depreciation and amortization increased by $1.7 million or 79% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of purchasing an aircraft in 2004, for which we then began recognizing depreciation. Wynn Macaus depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by $1.7 million from 2003 to 2004, primarily resulting from the amortization of the Macau gaming concession asset, which increased from 2003 to correspond to the increase in asset value, due to the purchase price allocation following the acquisition of the minority interest previously held by third parties in September of 2004, and the amortization of the leasehold interest in land acquired as part of the land concession agreement entered into in June 2004. Corporate and other depreciation and amortization decreased by $2.1 million or 59% from 2003 to 2004, primarily as a result of fully depreciating the remaining assets purchased from the Desert Inn Resort and Casino, including the parking garage, in June 2003. Property charges and other In 2004, we sold our existing aircraft and purchased two other aircraft. The aircraft sale resulted in a loss of approximately $550,000, which is the primary component of the increase in property charges compared to 2003. In addition, incidental operations relating to certain cellular tower rental income, plus the loss from the brief operation of an apartment complex purchased in July 2004 (for the subsequent development of a parking facility across Sands Avenue from Wynn Las Vegas), produced an additional increase in the property charges for 2004 compared to 2003. Other non operating costs and expenses Other income (expense), net for 2004, decreased approximately $125.5 million to an expense of approximately $115.4 million from income of approximately $10.1 million for 2003, primarily as a result of losses sustained from the early retirement of debt in both the second and fourth quarters of 2004. On June 14, 2004, we recorded a loss of approximately $25.6 million due to the early retirement of a portion of the Second Mortgage Notes. The loss was attributable to the 112% redemption premium and to write offs of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. On December 14, 2004, as part of the refinancing of Wynn Las 43 Vegas, we recorded an additional loss on the early retirement of debt totaling approximately $97.2 million. This loss reflected the tender price on approximately $237.4 million of Second Mortgage Notes plus the write offs of the related unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Also during 2004, there was an approximately $9.1 million decrease in interest income and a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense. Lower interest income was primarily attributable to the decrease in average amount of cash from the net proceeds from equity and debt financing activity as the funds were used to construct Wynn Las Vegas offset by approximately $1.4 million of interest rate swap fair market value increases, while the interest expense decreased due to increased capitalization of interest commensurate with the progress on the construction of Wynn Las Vegas. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operations Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income, interest paid, and non cash charges included in operating income. During 2003 and 2004, we were solely a development stage company without material operations. During those periods, net cash used in operations was $21.8 million and $114.8 million, respectively. On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating cash from operations. Net cash from operations in 2005 was $48.5 million. Because 2005 did not include a full year of operations and because significant pre opening expenses were incurred during 2005, we believe that cash flows from operations for 2005 are not indicative of future results. Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $434.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available for use without restriction, including for new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas, or to support the development and construction of Wynn Macau and Encore. Of this, approximately $308.0 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of either Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs or Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt, and therefore is not obligated to apply any of its funds to either Encore or Wynn Macau. We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Otherwise we attempt to minimize the amount of cash held in banks. Accordingly, excess funds are swept from accounts into overnight investments or to repay borrowings under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $442.6 million in restricted cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings. Of this amount, approximately $394.8 million is restricted for the remaining costs of Wynn Las Vegas and the construction, development and pre opening expenses of Encore, including $80.0 million restricted for the Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30.0 million of which must be retained for Encore for a completion guarantee if the budget, plans and specifications for Encore (the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs) are approved); approximately $31.8 million is restricted for the ongoing development, construction and pre opening expenses of Wynn Macau; and approximately $15.0 million is restricted for two semi annual interest payments on our 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2015 (the Convertible Debentures), $7.5 million of which was paid on January 15, 2006, with the remaining $7.5 million due and payable on July 15, 2006. In addition, there is approximately $1.0 million restricted for certain sales tax and other payments. Cash equivalents include investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing the Companys debt facilities. Construction and Development Wynn Las Vegas Wynn Las Vegas, except for one of its two theaters, opened on April 28, 2005. The total Wynn Las Vegas project cost (excluding Encore other than the land for Encore) was approximately $2.74 billion. This includes 44 land acquisition costs, design and construction costs, financing fees, interest and other pre opening expenses. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $18.9 million of budgeted project costs and retention amounts remained to be paid in order to close out the project. We expect these final costs to be paid in the second quarter of 2006. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we have made and continue to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, we were permitted to make up to $40.0 million of capital expenditures in 2005, of which we actually expended $37.9 million. In 2006, we will be permitted to make up to $80.0 million of capital expenditures at Wynn Las Vegas. These spending limits are increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas On March 15, 2006, we submitted the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs to our lenders for approval. We expect to commence construction of Encore in the second quarter of 2006, and open it to the public by the end of 2008. Wynn Macau In June 2004, we began construction of Wynn Macau. Design and construction is progressing on schedule and within budget. Superstructure works are complete for the podium and tower. Certain areas in the first phase of the project, namely retail and the information technology data center, have been handed over to operations. Final design work on the second phase has largely been completed and construction work on the second phase is rapidly moving from the foundations to the structure. Construction milestones since groundbreaking include the following: Phase I All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities; The foundation pile cap construction and underground drainage are complete; The highrise building superstructure, roof placement and signature swoosh are complete; The parking garage is complete; The lowrise podium superstructure is complete; Interior work continues in the lowrise podium areas such as the casino and ballrooms; and Installation of central plant and equipment, including generators, boilers, chillers and cooling towers, continues. Phase II (expansion) All external drainage diversion works have been completed and commissioned and the road has been delivered to local authorities; Design is progressing; consultancy agreements have been awarded and interior design concepts are being developed; Piling is complete and pile cap activities are underway; Deep excavation for the front feature has been completed; Basement tunnels and corridors have been completed; and Plans for an expanded casino have been finalized. 45 The current total project budget for Wynn Macau (including the approximately $70.0 million expansion of the second phase and suite enhancements) is approximately $1.2 billion, including contingencies, but excluding up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Under the amended and restated construction contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be designed by one of our subsidiaries) based on an existing scope of work and design specifications for both the first phase and the expansion as provided by us, for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $457.2 million (including the contractors fee and contingency). We expect that the guaranteed maximum price will be increased by approximately $23.0 million to reflect addition of the casino expansion to the second phase of Wynn Macau. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has incurred approximately $427.2 million of a total $1.2 billion project budget. Approximately $748.4 million remains to be spent to complete Wynn Macau. Financing Activities Wynn Las Vegas and Encore On December 14, 2004, we completed a series of transactions that refinanced Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs debt structure and provided the additional funds to develop Encore. The closing of the refinancing was the culmination of a series of transactions designed to facilitate the development of Encore, lower our overall cost of borrowing, and achieve an enhanced degree of financial maturity. In addition, the refinancing provided us with the financial flexibility to continue to develop our real estate assets. Although a final accounting for Wynn Las Vegas is not expected until the second quarter of 2006, Wynn Las Vegas estimated $2.74 billion total project cost has been, and will be, funded from a combination of contributed capital from the original shareholders of Valvino Lamore, LLC (the predecessor of Wynn Resorts), proceeds from sales of our common stock, proceeds from the issuance of the Second Mortgage Notes (which were discharged in connection with the December 2004 refinancing), proceeds from the issuance of First Mortgage Notes, and a portion of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs $1.0 billion credit facilities (the Credit Facilities), which consist of a $400 million term loan facility (the Term Loan) and a $600 million revolving facility (the Revolver). The Revolver is available for Wynn Las Vegas general corporate purposes and for Encore, and any amounts repaid may be re borrowed. In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed $80.0 million under the Revolver and loaned it to Wynn Macau, S.A. as subordinated debt. This borrowing was repaid by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in the third quarter of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, $10.0 million has been borrowed and remains outstanding under the Revolver. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities have been and are expected to continue to be, designated by us as Eurodollar Loans. These Eurodollar Loans bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.25% for the Revolver loans and LIBOR plus 2.125%, for the Term Loans. Interest on Eurodollar Loans is payable at the end of the applicable interest period in the case of interest periods of one, two or three months, and every three months in the case of interest periods of six months. After the opening of Encore, the applicable borrowing margins for Eurodollar revolving loans will range from 1.25% to 2.5% per annum depending on Wynn Las Vegas leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, 0.75% per annum on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the Revolver. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Revolver will be based on Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs leverage ratio and will range from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum. The Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by each of its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations and guarantees are secured by: (1) a first priority security interest on a $30.0 million liquidity reserve account; (2) a $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account held by Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC; (3) the remaining previously funded proceeds of the 46 Credit Facilities; (4) a first priority pledge of all members interests owned by Wynn Las Vegas, LLC in its subsidiaries (other than Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC) and Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLCs 100% members interest in Wynn Las Vegas, LLC; (5) first mortgages on all real property constituting Wynn Las Vegas, its golf course and Encore; and (6) a first priority security interest in substantially all other existing and future assets of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors, excluding a corporate aircraft owned by World Travel, LLC, a subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on December 14, 2009, and the Term Loan will mature on December 14, 2011. The amount available under Credit Facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved by March 31, 2006. This may result in a reduction of availability under the Revolver, required prepayment of term loans, or any combination of the two. Until the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are approved, the availability of notes proceeds and funds under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit agreement for this project is limited to $100.0 million, of which we have spent approximately $40.7 million through December 31, 2005. We expect to receive approval of the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs by March 31, 2006. However, if the Encore Budget, Plans and Specs are not approved, the available borrowings under our Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities will be reduced by $550.0 million. We expect that the available remaining proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes, together with availability under the credit facilities, and cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to pay for expenditures of up to $1.52 billion on the Encore project without incurring additional debt or receiving additional capital contributions from Wynn Resorts. Project costs exceeding $1.52 billion will be funded by the issuance of up to $100.0 million of additional notes and or contributions from Wynn Resorts. We expect to open Encore by the end of 2008. On March 15, 2006, we amended our Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities to (a) allow the Company to issue up to $100.0 million of additional First Mortgage Notes; (b) simplify draw procedures under the Disbursement Agreement; (c) consolidate certain accounts under the Disbursement Agreement; (d) amend and clarify certain of the conditions for the Phase II Approval Date; (e) extend the outside opening date for Encore and the outside completion date for Encore to June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009, respectively and (f) permit expenditures of up to $150.0 million on Encore prior to the execution of a guaranteed maximum price contract. The final costs of Wynn Las Vegas will be paid from previously funded amounts under the First Mortgage Notes and the Term Loan and the ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority: First, by using agreed excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts; Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Credit Facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Credit Facilities; and Fourth, by using the funds from the $50.0 million completion guarantee deposit account. In December 2004, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Credit Facilities. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 47 Wynn Macau Financing for Wynn Macaus design, development, construction and pre opening expenses is provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of base equity loans totaling $230 million, subordinated loan financing (provided from funds borrowed under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC revolving credit facility) totaling $80 million, and a senior secured credit facility. On September 14, 2005, we amended the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility to expand its availability from $397 million to $764 million, to currently include $729 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156 million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2005, we have borrowed approximately $78.9 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility. The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans will bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin of 3.0% until the opening of Wynn Macau (expected in the third quarter of 2006), at which time the interest rate will reduce to LIBOR or HIBOR plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A. satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus 2.5%. Collateral for the senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. We began to draw under the Senior Secured Facilities in October 2005, after expenditure of the base equity and subordinated funding. Through December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $427.2 million of the total $1.2 billion of budgeted project costs. Total budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) of approximately $688.0 million, land acquisition costs of approximately $49.0 million, the additional casino expansion of approximately $70.0 million and capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and other costs totaling in the aggregate approximately $368.6 million. These costs have been, and will continue to be, paid from the previously funded $230.0 million base equity and loans from Wynn Resorts and $80.0 million borrowed under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs revolving credit agreement and loaned as subordinated debt, as well as Wynn Macau, S.A.s $764.0 million senior secured credit facility and cash flows from operations once Wynn Macau opens. As of December 31, 2005, project costs still to be incurred totaled approximately $748.4 million. In addition to the above financing sources, we have $30.0 million (plus $1.8 million of accumulated interest earnings) of long term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity and a $72.0 million contingent debt facility available for Wynn Macau. We entered into interest rate swap agreements in October 2005 to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau, S.A. credit facilities. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Other In the second quarter of 2005, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $44.75 million secured by a corporate aircraft. The loans mature on May 24, 2010. Principal and interest is payable quarterly, and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, we are required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft occur. Beginning December 31, 2006, we may prepay all or any portion of the loans, subject to a minimum prepayment of $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $43.5 million was outstanding under this borrowing. Expected Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes certain information regarding our expected long term indebtedness and material commercial commitments based upon our best estimate at December 31, 2005 of our expected long term 48 indebtedness and commercial commitments (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Long Term Indebtedness Total Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years First Mortgage Notes $ 1,300.0 $ $ $ $ 1,300.0 Convertible Subordinated Debentures[1] 250.0 250.0 Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities[2] 410.0 10.0 400.0 Macau Senior Credit Facilities[3] 79.0 17.3 44.9 16.8 Second Mortgage Notes[4] 10.1 10.1 Other Long Term Obligations[5] 57.7 5.8 12.6 29.3 10.0 Total long term indebtedness $ 2,106.8 $ 15.9 $ 29.9 $ 84.2 $ 1,976.8 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years Construction contracts and commitments $ 348.1 $ 208.4 $ 139.7 $ $ Employment agreements 103.6 31.9 41.9 10.9 18.9 Leasehold interest in land[6] 30.0 9.6 14.2 6.2 Operating leases 19.1 3.8 4.1 3.7 7.5 Estimated interest payments on long term debt[7] 1,170.2 148.5 290.6 285.0 446.0 Total commercial commitments $ 1,671.0 $ 402.2 $ 490.5 $ 305.8 $ 472.4 [1] Represents the full obligation under the Convertible Debentures assuming no conversion to common stock. The Convertible Debentures are convertible, at the holders option, into a maximum of 10,869,550 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment as provided in the indenture governing the Convertible Debentures), which is equivalent to a conversion price of $23.00 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 through the filing of this report, approximately $3.8 million of the Convertible Debentures were converted into common stock. [2] As of December 31, 2005, we had $400.0 million of Term Loans outstanding and $10.0 million outstanding under the Revolver, which mature on December 14, 2011 and December 14, 2009, respectively. The $590.0 million remaining available under the Revolver may be used for working capital for Wynn Las Vegas or, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, for the construction and development of Encore. [3] As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowed approximately $79.0 million under Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior credit facilities. We anticipate that we will borrow the remaining available amounts to construct and open Wynn Macau and its expansion by the third quarter of 2007. Principal amortization begins in 2007 and the facility matures on September 14, 2011. [4] On December 14, 2004, we deposited in trust with the trustee under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture, government securities having an aggregate face value of approximately $10.1 million (the amounts necessary to pay when due all interest payments and the redemption price on November 1, 2006), and an additional $3.0 million in cash to discharge amounts payable under the Second Mortgage Notes Indenture. [5] Represents the $43.5 million outstanding of the $44.75 million original term loan borrowing secured by a corporate aircraft bearing interest at LIBOR plus 2.375%; $13.3 million remaining outstanding on a 5.67% note payable pursuant to a loan to finance our other corporate aircraft; and the remaining amount of an 8% annuity issued by ITT Sheraton in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of land in 1994. The $43.5 million aircraft loan requires quarterly amortizing principal and interest payments and matures on May 24, 2010; the $13.3 million aircraft loan notes requires monthly principal and interest payments with balloon payments of $9.6 million in 2011; and the annuity requires payments of $5,000 per month until February 2009. 49 [6] In June 2004, we entered into a land concession contract with the government of Macau for a 25 year lease of approximately 16 acres of land. At December 31, 2005, we had 8 semi annual installment payments remaining at 5% interest, as specified in the land concession contract. [7] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments and anticipated LIBOR rates based upon expected yield curves (including the effect of our interest rate swaps) as well as expected timing of repayments. Other Liquidity Matters Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the Indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; provided that the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales. If completion of Encore or Wynn Macau projects is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau, upon opening, will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions 50 integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates During the construction and development of a resort, pre opening or start up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas, significant start up costs were incurred and charged to pre opening expenses through the second quarter of 2005, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened to the public, expenses associated with the opening of the resort were no longer charged as pre opening expenses. However, start up costs relating to the Encore and Wynn Macau projects will continue to be charged to pre opening expenses. During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon opening of Wynn Las Vegas, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets. Depreciation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the corresponding assets as follows: Buildings and improvements 10 to 45 years Land improvements 10 to 45 years Airplanes 7 to 20 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 to 20 years The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed. A charge resulting from a change in the estimated period of benefit is accounted for in the period of change as a change in accounting estimate under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 20, Accounting Changes. Our leasehold interest in the land leased in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, will commence in the third quarter of 2006, when Wynn Macau opens. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau will be the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged on an accelerated basis when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Costs of building repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss. We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the 51 undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and Macau. We account for income taxes according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carry forwards and certain temporary differences. The standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses which, among other things, generated significant deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2005, we had $199.9 million of deferred tax assets and $99.7 million of deferred tax liabilities. At this time, because of our limited operating history, we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. If these net deferred tax assets become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS No. 109, we intend to appropriately reduce the deferred tax asset reserves. Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable We evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2005, approximately 70% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries. As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy or legal system occur. Derivative Financial Instruments We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. Significant Judgmental Accruals We estimate liabilities for certain self insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of 52 these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement, according to SEC rule, as amended, on January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and the Black Scholes valuation model. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulleting (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and will therefore impact our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). We estimate that the expensing of stock options will reduce our net income for 2006 by approximately $12.8 million (or $0.13 per share) for the unvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2005. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, for a description of other recently issued accounting pronouncements, which are relevant to the Company but which we believe will not have a material impact on the Company. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Risks Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 53 The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2005 on our expected long term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2005 of 4.37875% and 4.11045%, respectively are used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 10.9 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 1,560.0 $ 1,574.2 Average interest rate 11.53 % 5.82 % 5.73 % 5.67 % 5.67 % 6.51 % 6.66 % Variable rate $ 5.0 $ 5.3 $ 22.9 $ 37.0 $ 45.6 $ 416.8 $ 532.6 Average interest rate 7.31 % 7.37 % 7.68 % 7.62 % 7.82 % 7.20 % 7.31 % Interest Rate Swap Information In 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company entered into interest rate swap arrangements relating to certain of its floating rate debt facilities, and accounts for these swaps under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133), and its related interpretations. Wynn Las Vegas swaps During 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $825.0 million of borrowings under our previous Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities. On December 14, 2004, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs debt structure, we terminated these two interest rate swaps. As a result of the termination, we received a cash payment of approximately $9.6 million in settlement of the related asset. Concurrent with the refinancing, we entered into two new interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $400.0 million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.125%. Under each of these two interest rate swap arrangements, we receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on $200 million notional amount set forth in the swap instruments from February and March 2005, respectively through December 2008. Although these interest rate swaps are highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on these borrowings under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.9%, changes in fair value of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period are, and will continue to be, recorded as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Wynn Macau On October 14, 2005, we entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on future borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under the first swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.3 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008. These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar and 50% of the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.84% and 54 7.77%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as a component of interest and other income as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Summary of Historical Fair Values The following table presents the historical asset or (liability) fair values (reflected in deposits and other assets or in other long term liabilities as appropriate) at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and as of the December 14, 2004 termination date of the previous Wynn Las Vegas interest rate swaps (amounts in thousands): WynnLas VegasPreviousInterestRate Swaps WynnLas VegasCurrentInterestRate Swaps WynnMacauInterestRate Swaps TotalInterestRate SwapAsset/(Liability) Asset / (liability) fair value: at December 31, 2005 $ $ 10,523 $ (1,788 ) $ 8,735 at December 31, 2004 $ $ 583 $ $ 583 at December 14, 2004 settlement $ 9,625 $ $ $ 9,625 at December 31, 2003 $ 8,793 $ $ $ 8,793 The fair value approximates the amount the Company would receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Other Interest Rate Swap Information The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2005 and using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ 651.7 $ 739.3 $ 739.3 $ $ $ n/a Average pay rate 4.17 % 4.26 % 4.24 % n/a Average receive rate 4.88 % 4.93 % 4.87 % n/a We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity For the year ended December 31, 2005, we incurred approximately $149.5 million in interest. Certain amounts of our outstanding indebtedness for the year was based upon a variable, LIBOR rate plus a premium. A 1% increase in the LIBOR would have increased our interest cost for 2005 by approximately $700,000. Foreign Currency Risks The currency delineated in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. 55 However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. In July 2005, officials from the Peoples Bank of China announced the adoption of a new foreign exchange policy that will move away from a U.S. dollar peg of 8.28 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. The renminbi will instead trade based on a basket of currencies. The currency components of the basket have not been announced. The exchange rate at September 30, 2005, was 8.11 Chinese renminbi to one U.S. dollar. Management believes that the current revaluation of the renminibi will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Certain Asian countries have publicly asserted their desire to eliminate the linkage of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar, and the Macau pataca will continue to be linked to the U.S. dollar, which may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level. Because many of Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk.
