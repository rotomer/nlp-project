MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), which opened on September 6, 2006. In addition, on April 28, 2006, we commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore), a hotel casino resort which, when completed, will be fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas. We are also currently expanding Wynn Macau and in November 2006, announced Wynn Diamond Suites an additional hotel tower for Wynn Macau. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company. Our Resorts The following table sets forth information about our operating properties as of February 2007: Hotel Rooms & Suites Approximate Casino Square Footage Number of TableGames Number of Slots Wynn Las Vegas 2,716 111,000 132 1,974 Wynn Macau 600 110,000 256 477 Wynn Las Vegas We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas features: An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book; Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas (In 2006, the Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas became the only casino resort in the world to receive both the Mobil five star and AAA five diamond distinctions); 22 food and beverage outlets featuring signature chefs, including the AAA Five Diamond and Mobil Five Star award winning restaurant, Alex; A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership; Approximately 74,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Brioni, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Jean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik; Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18 hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and full service spa and salon; and Showroom, nightclub and lounge entertainment. The resort, which is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar and improved public baccarat space along with private baccarat salons, converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories 36 Table of Contents and our ladies shoe boutique in the retail esplanade. In March 2007, we intend to remodel the Le Reve Theatre, decreasing the seat count from 2,087 to 1,606 and further enhancing the guest experience. We expect the remodel effort to last approximately 30 days during which there will be no performances of Le Reve. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas We are constructing Encore on approximately 20 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Encores current plans include a 2,034 all suite hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, an approximately 72,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as well as restaurants, a nightclub, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We continue to refine the final design of Encore. Encore is expected to open in early 2009. Our project budget is currently estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the theatre remodeling and production of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas. The budget has increased from the previously announced $1.74 billion due to refinements in scope and market conditions for construction materials. The project budget will be funded from our existing credit facilities, remaining proceeds from the first mortgage notes and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas. To the extent additional funds are required, we will provide these amounts with additional debt and equity contributions by Wynn Resorts. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment to its bank lenders under which Wynn Resorts is obligated to pay project costs if Wynn Las Vegas is unable to. As of August 2006, Wynn Resorts obligation under the equity commitment was $70 million. On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement (the Contract) with Tutor Saliba Corporation (Tutor) for the design and construction of Encore. The Contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor will design and construct Encore. In addition to the terms and conditions governing the design and construction of Encore, the Contract provides that the parties will negotiate a guaranteed maximum price (the Encore GMP) for the construction and design of Encore within 90 days of execution of the Contract. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon a GMP during the 90 day period, the Company can, at its option, (a) continue to employ Tutor for construction and design services on a cost plus basis, (b) agree to alternative arrangements with Tutor or (c) terminate the Contract. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Contract, Tutor and the Ronald N. Tutor Separate Trust (the Trust) have entered into and consented to a Net Worth Agreement pursuant to which (x) the Trust agreed that it will retain its current majority holdings of Tutor and (y) the Trust and Tutor agreed that during the term of the Contract, Tutor will maintain (i) net worth of at least $100 million, and (ii) liquid assets of at least $50 million. Wynn Macau We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006. Wynn Macau is located on 11 acres of a total site area of 16 acres of land and features: An approximately 110,000 square foot casino offering 24 hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, approximately 256 table games and approximately 477 slot machines; Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites; Casual and fine dining in five restaurants; Approximately 26,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Dior, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Tiffany, Bulgari, Piaget and others; Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and Entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. Construction and development continues on the second phase. This phase includes approximately 123,000 square feet of additional gaming space, a dramatic front feature attraction, a theater showroom and additional 37 Table of Contents food, beverage and retail amenities, which we expect to open in the third quarter of 2007. After the completion of the expansion, Wynn Macau is expected to have a total of approximately 420 table games and 1,280 slot machines. In addition, we continue to develop the plans and budget for the further expansion of Wynn Macau, which was first announced in November 2006. This further expansion will add a second self contained, fully integrated resort hotel named Wynn Diamond Suites, as well as gaming areas, food and beverage, retail and entertainment amenities. We continue to work on a budget and final design for Wynn Diamond Suites. We operate Wynn Macau under a 20 year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. In September 2006, we sold the right to a subconcession to operate games of chance in Macau, to Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (PBL) for $900 million. Cotai Development We have submitted an application to the Macau government for a concession of land in Cotai. We recently reconfigured our site plan for 52 acres and are awaiting final approval. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons: On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau completed the sale of a Macau subconcession right and received a cash payment of $900 million. On September 6, 2006, we opened Wynn Macau and began generating operating cash flow from this project; On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating operating cash flow; Prior to April 28, 2005, we were solely a development stage company; Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 include a full period of operations for Wynn Las Vegas and 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau. In contrast, the year ended December 31, 2005 includes 248 days of Wynn Las Vegas operations only. The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands). For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 Net Revenues: Wynn Las Vegas $ 1,138,549 $ 721,981 Wynn Macau 293,708 Total Net revenues $ 1,432,257 $ 721,981 The reliance on our operating cash flow from only two properties exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two properties, many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results. Operating Measures Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussions of the Companys operational performance for the periods presented. Casinos generally record win as a percentage of 38 Table of Contents either drop or turnover. In our casino operations at Wynn Las Vegas, table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop. However, in our casino operations at Wynn Macau, we separate table play into two distinct segments. Our Macau VIP casino segment records table games win as a percentage of turnover, whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop. Below are definitions of the statistics discussed: Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue. Drop is the amount of cash or net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box. Turnover is the sum of all losing wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program. Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau and is recorded as casino revenue. Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied. Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 are comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of net non casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 were comprised of $353.7 million in net casino revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of net non gaming revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts non gaming amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in the two properties ADR and other non gaming revenues. Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $800.6 million, which represents approximately a $446.9 million (or 126.4%) increase from the casino revenues of $353.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in casino revenues is driven primarily by the opening of Wynn Macau in September 2006 and Wynn Las Vegas being open for all of 2006 as opposed to only 248 days in 2005. At Wynn Las Vegas, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 22.1% was within the expected range of 20% to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas for 2006 increased as compared to 2005, however the slot win percentage for 2006 was slightly below the expected range of 5% to 6%. Wynn Macaus win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 2.4% of turnover was below the expected range of 2.5% to 2.8%. However, turnover, the leading volume indicator in the VIP casino, met managements expectations. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 17.1% of drop was at the lower end of the expected range of 17% to 19%, and the volume of table game play was as expected. We believe that the results of operations for the first 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau are not indicative of results to be expected in the future. We expect that over time hold percentages will normalize and that operating efficiencies will emerge. For the year ended December 31, 2006, room revenues were approximately $283.1 million, which represents a $112.8 million (or 66.2%) increase over the $170.3 million generated in the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily driven by Wynn Las Vegas being open for the 39 Table of Contents full year as opposed to 248 days of operations in 2005, as well as Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations in 2006. See the table below for key operating measures related to room revenue. For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 Average Daily Rate Wynn Las Vegas $ 287 $ 274 Wynn Macau $ 238 N/A Occupancy Wynn Las Vegas 94.4 % 92.1 % Wynn Macau 80.6 % N/A REVPAR Wynn Las Vegas $ 271 $ 253 Wynn Macau $ 192 N/A Other non casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $87.7 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $51.2 million. Other non casino revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. The additional revenue earned in Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations during 2006 contributed to the increase in the food and beverage and retail revenues. In addition, food and beverage revenues in 2006 benefited significantly from increased revenues from the nightclub located in Wynn Las Vegas as compared to the 2005 food and beverage revenues. Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, rooms expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2005, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, room expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of 117 days of the operations of Wynn Macau and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues. In addition, on January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payments, using the modified prospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $15.4 million of share based compensation expense which is included in the department of the recipient of the stock based award. Prior to January 1, 2006, we did not recognize expense for employee stock options that were granted at the market price. See our Consolidated Financial Statements Note 15 for more information. Pre opening costs Pre opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $62.7 million compared to $96.9 million for the prior year. Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006, accounted for $60.5 million of the current year pre opening costs while the balance relates primarily to Encore. Pre opening costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 related primarily to Wynn Las Vegas which opened on April 28, 2005 and Wynn Macau. We 40 Table of Contents expect that Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses will continue during 2007, although at lesser amounts, as construction and development of the second phase continues toward the expected completion in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, as Encore progresses, pre opening expenses related to this project will increase as the opening approaches. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $175.5 million increased by $72.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to including a full year for Wynn Las Vegas and an additional 117 days of operations of Wynn Macau. Wynn Las Vegas only recorded 248 days of depreciation in 2005. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation for long lived assets related to Wynn Macau is charged generally over shorter useful lives when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. Contract Termination Fee In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas Broadway Theatre at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million. This fee was recorded in the first quarter of 2006. We have remodeled the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas in anticipation of commencing performances of Monty Pythons Spamalot in the first quarter of 2007. Property charges and other Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $25.1 million increased by $10.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2006. Costs relating to assets retired as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $14.4 million have been expensed as property charges. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons, converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories, and remodeled our ladies shoe boutique in the retail esplanade. In March 2007, we intend to remodel the Le Reve Theatre, decreasing the seat count from 2,087 to 1,606 and further enhancing the guest experience. We expect the remodel effort to last approximately 30 days during which time there will be no performances of Le Reve. Although Wynn Las Vegas property charges have decreased in recent quarters, we expect that enhancements and refinements to Wynn Macau will take place in response to reactions from our customers in that market. Accordingly, we expect that Company property charges may increase in future periods. In December 2006, Wynn Macau donated an early Ming dynasty vase to the Macau Museum. We purchased the vase in May 2006 for approximately $10.1 million. The vase had been on public display at Wynn Macau 41 Table of Contents prior to its donation to the museum. The $10.1 million expense for the donation of the Ming Vase is included in Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income of $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $18.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances compared to 2005, as well as interest earned on the PBL proceeds. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million was $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $102.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $50.0 million for the same period in 2005. This increase is due to the increase in our borrowings in Macau, slightly higher interest rates and the $20.5 million decrease in interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened. Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). On August 15, 2006, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities), we terminated a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap relating to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as non operating income or expense in each period. We recorded approximately $1.2 million of interest rate swap income for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 (December 31, 2005 to August 15, 2006 in the case of the terminated swap). During the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a gain of $8.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Loss from extinguishment of debt totaled $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. On August 15, 2006 we refinanced our Wynn Las Vegas senior credit facilities as discussed in further detail below (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities). As a result of the refinancing and resulting modification of the Term Loan, we recorded a loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $10.8 million to reflect the write off of the previous Term Loans unamortized deferred financing costs. In addition, on November 1, 2006, we redeemed the remaining approximate $10.1 million of our Second Mortgage Notes and incurred a $1.7 million redemption premium which is also included as loss from extinguishment of debt. On November 13, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors declared a special one time cash distribution of $6.00 per share on its outstanding common stock. This special one time distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, the Company made a special payment to the holders of its Debentures so that they participated in the special distribution as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock prior to the record date. The Company paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount, or $58.5 million in total. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the special cash distribution. The payment was recorded as a distribution to convertible debenture holders in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gain on sale of subconcession right On March 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement with PBL pursuant to which we agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a subconcession to allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau. 42 Table of Contents On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the subconcession and on September 11, 2006, PBL paid $900 million in cash to Wynn Macau, S.A. for the subconcession right. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, we have no continuing rights or obligations with respect to the subconcession. All rights and obligations under the subconcession are between PBL and the government of Macau. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2006, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.3%. This rate was lower than the federal statutory rate due to the reduction of our valuation allowance in connection with the sale of the PBL subconcession right and a reduced effective tax rate on our foreign operations (see footnote 17 Income Taxes). Their were no comparable items in 2004 and 2005 as we had not yet reached a conclusion that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets were realizable. Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5 year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $4.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 248 days of operations at Wynn Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2005 have no comparisons to 2004 as we were solely a development stage company prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Revenues Wynn Las Vegas net gaming revenues were $353.7 million for the 248 days of operations during the year ended December 31, 2005. During that period, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 21.5% was within the expected range of 18% to 22%, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 5% to 6% of handle. For the 248 days of operations in 2005, Wynn Las Vegas gross room revenues were approximately $170.3 million. ADR and occupancy for that period were $274 and 92.1%, respectively, generating REVPAR of $253. Other non gaming revenues included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. Departmental, Administrative, and Other Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2005, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, rooms expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. At opening, Wynn Las Vegas employed approximately 9,200 persons to accommodate increased opening needs. Natural staffing attrition reduced the number of employees at the end of 2005 to approximately 8,900 persons. Pre opening costs Pre opening costs were $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Pre opening costs related to our Wynn Las Vegas project were $67.5 43 Table of Contents million and $41.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The large amount of pre opening costs incurred in 2005 was due primarily to the substantial increase in staffing preceding the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Pre opening costs related to our Wynn Macau project were $20.4 million and $16.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Wynn Macaus pre opening costs continued to increase through the opening in the third quarter of 2006. Included in pre opening costs are corporate costs of $9.1 million and $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. After Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, such corporate expenses were charged to general and administrative expense instead of pre opening. Corporate staffing and related costs did not increase significantly immediately before or after opening of Wynn Las Vegas; instead, the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to having a 117 day pre opening period in 2005, compared with a 365 day pre opening period in 2004. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened and these assets were placed into service, we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly. Property charges and other In response to our evaluation of the finished product and in response to the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the total $14.3 million for Wynn Las Vegas property charges and other for 2005 are approximately $9.4 million of costs relating to assets retired as a result of the remodel efforts at Wynn Las Vegas, and approximately $3.1 million of expenses relating to the abandonment of improvements made to the temporary offices utilized during part of the construction and development of the resort. Once we decided to remodel the Broadway Theater to present Spamalot, we also wrote off approximately $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2005 in connection with the preliminary design and development of a third theater originally planned to house Monty Pythons Spamalot, and later abandoned. There were no comparable Wynn Las Vegas property charges incurred during 2004. Property charges in 2004 instead reflect net losses on ordinary asset sales, including an aircraft sold in 2004 at a loss of approximately $550,000. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income increased by $19.6 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is due primarily to the significant increase in the amount of average cash balances available and invested from the remaining proceeds of our 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes) and borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities that were invested during 2005, compared to 2004. Interest expense, net, increased by $100.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the significant decrease in the amount of interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas opened, plus the increase in the long term debt resulting from our December 2004 refinancing and credit facility borrowings during 2005. We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings supplemented by the use of derivative financial instruments as required or considered necessary. We were required to, and did obtain through interest rate swap arrangements, interest 44 Table of Contents rate protection for portions of our borrowings under our credit facilities. These interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an increase in swap fair value of approximately $8.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Also during 2004, we recorded a $122.8 million loss from extinguishment of debt related to the early retirement of the majority of the original $370.0 million of 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes). This loss resulted from the write off of associated deferred financing costs and original issue discount, as well as a 12% redemption premium, on the Second Mortgage Notes. We repurchased the remaining principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes totaling approximately $10.1 million on November 1, 2006 (the first available call date), at which time an additional loss of $1.7 million was recorded to reflect the redemption premium and write off of the remaining financing costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operations Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income generated by Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, interest paid, and non cash charges included in operating income. Net cash from operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $240.8 million compared to $48.5 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, we were solely a development stage company and did not generate operational cash flow. Capital Resources We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Our cash balances at December 31, 2006, were higher than in prior periods due to the opening of Wynn Macau and approximately $517 million remaining from the $900 million cash received from PBL on September 11, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $789.4 million of cash and cash equivalents available for new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, and to support the development and construction of Encore and the second phase of Wynn Macau. Of this amount, approximately $54.7 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. However, Wynn Resorts, Limited has provided an equity commitment agreement to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs secured lenders, which obligates Wynn Resorts, Limited to contribute up to $70 million for Encore project costs if Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is unable to pay such costs. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $237.4 million in cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings, which is restricted for the following: Construction, development and pre opening expenses of Encore; Construction, development and pre opening expenses of the second phase of Wynn Macau; Remaining costs to be paid in relation to Wynn Macaus first phase; $30 million of contingent equity restricted for Wynn Macau; $80 million restricted for the Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30 million of which must be retained for Encore); and Remaining costs for completion of Wynn Las Vegas, estimated to be approximately $3.2 million. Cash equivalents include investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing our debt facilities. 45 Table of Contents Investing Activities Encore at Wynn Las Vegas On April 28, 2006, we commenced construction on Encore. We expect to open Encore to the public in early 2009. Design and construction is progressing as expected at Encore. Current construction activities in the various project sections since groundbreaking include the following: The high rise concrete pours have been completed through the 15th floor deck. The installation of the reinforcing rebar for the shear walls and columns for the 16h floor is underway. Construction of the guest self park garage has reached level 6 with beams and deck forms installed. Low rise excavation is complete with the exception of the pool deck which has just begun. The footings for the main casino area are 95% complete. The employee parking garage located on our Koval property is complete and in use. Our project budget is currently estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the theatre remodeling and production of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas. The budget has increased from the previously announced $1.74 billion due to refinements in scope and market conditions for construction materials. The project budget will be funded from our existing credit facilities, remaining proceeds from the first mortgage notes and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas. To the extent additional funds are required, we will provide these amounts with additional debt and equity contributions by Wynn Resorts. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment to its bank lenders under which Wynn Resorts is obligated to pay project costs if Wynn Las Vegas is unable to. As of August 2006, Wynn Resorts obligation under the equity commitment was $70 million. On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement (the Contract) with Tutor Saliba Corporation (Tutor) for the design and construction of Encore. The Contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor will design and construct Encore. In addition to the terms and conditions governing the design and construction of Encore, the Contract provides that the parties will negotiate a guaranteed maximum price (the Encore GMP) for the construction and design of Encore within 90 days of execution of the Contract. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon a GMP during the 90 day period, the Company can, at its option, (a) continue to employ Tutor for construction and design services on a cost plus basis, (b) agree to alternative arrangements with Tutor or (c) terminate the Contract. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Contract, Tutor and the Ronald N. Tutor Separate Trust (the Trust) have entered into and consented to a Net Worth Agreement pursuant to which (x) the Trust agreed that it will retain its current majority holdings of Tutor and (y) the Trust and Tutor agreed that during the term of the Contract, Tutor will maintain (i) net worth of at least $100 million, and (ii) liquid assets of at least $50 million. As of December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $277.6 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore and related capital improvements. These costs, net of approximately $8.1 million of retention, have been funded from the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, the remaining funds from the First Mortgage Notes and cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas. Prior to signing a guaranteed maximum price construction contract, we are permitted to spend up to $300 million of the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and the credit facilities on Encore project costs. As of December 31, 2006, we have spent or committed approximately $206.3 million using these debt proceeds. The remaining $63.2 million has been funded from cash flows from operations. The ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority: First, by using agreed amounts of excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts; 46 Table of Contents Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities and; Fourth, by using the funds from the completion guarantee deposit account. Wynn Las Vegas In the third quarter of 2005, we began to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, we were permitted to make up to $100 million of capital expenditures in 2006, of which we have expended approximately $52.8 million. For 2007, we will be permitted to spend $172.2 million including $47.2 million which is carried forward from 2006. The spending limit will be increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts, Limited. Le Reve Production Rights On May 31, 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all intellectual property rights related to Le Reve, which were previously only licensed to us. We paid $15.9 million to acquire substantially all of the rights in and to Le Reve, and to repay approximately $1.4 million of production costs, which were reimbursable to the executive producer of Le Reve. The rights acquired enable us to produce, present, enhance, or alter the performance of Le Reve after May 31, 2006. Wynn Macau The first phase of Wynn Macau was completed, and the casino resort opened, on September 6, 2006. The construction of the second phase is progressing and is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2007. The overall Wynn Macau project remains within budget and the second phase is progressing according to the expected timeframe. Significant construction accomplishments for the second phase include: Completion of the building sub structure (i.e. below ground pilings and footings) and above ground super structure; Completion of the external walls and roof; Steady progress of the interior fit out and mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems; and Occupation by Permit for certain portions of the ground floor public space. The current total project budget for Wynn Macau (excluding the developing budget for Wynn Diamond Suites and related amenities) is approximately $1.2 billion, including contingencies, but excluding up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Under the Amended and Restated Construction Contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be designed by one of our subsidiaries) based on an existing scope of work and design specifications for both the first phase and the expansion as provided by us, for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $484 million (including the contractors fee and contingency). On June 22, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received consent from its lending syndicate permitting Wynn Macau, S.A. to enter into three change orders to its guaranteed maximum price construction contract. The three change orders implement a series of amendments to the Construction Contract including, providing for the completion of the majority of the first floor of the Wynn Macau expansion as additional gaming space, a series of 47 Table of Contents enhancements and upgrades to the overall project, and adding an electronic marquee sign at the entrance to Wynn Macau. The change orders increased the guaranteed maximum price under the Construction Contract from $457 million to approximately $484 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has incurred approximately $877.1 million of the total project budget (excluding Wynn Diamond Suites) of approximately $1.2 billion. Financing Activities Wynn Las Vegas and Encore On August 15, 2006, we refinanced our Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver) and our Delay Draw Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan)(together, the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities). On August 15, 2006, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) which, among other things, (i) increased the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from $1.0 billion to $1.125 billion by increasing the Revolver from $600 million to $900 million and reducing the Term Loan from $400 million to $225 million; (ii) reduced the borrowing margins on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based Revolver and Term Loan to 1.625% and 1.875%, respectively; (iii) extended the maturity dates for the Revolver and the Term Loans to 2011 and 2013, respectively; and (iv) reduced the consolidated interest coverage ratio requirement for quarterly periods on or prior to December 31, 2007 to 2.00:1. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also: (i) reduced the range of the Revolvers annual LIBOR borrowing margin after the opening of Encore from a range of 1.25% to 2.50% to a range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio; and (ii) simplified the procedures for and conditions to obtaining advances and reduced the reporting obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including fully utilizing all previously funded amounts under the First Mortgage Notes for payment of Encore project costs. As a result of the refinancing discussed above, borrowings under the Term Loan were reduced to $225 million, under which we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans which bear interest at 1 month LIBOR and include a margin of 1.875% on that outstanding balance. We had two $200 million notional amount interest rate swaps to essentially fix the interest on the $400 million of former Term Loan. When we completed the refinancing on August 15, 2006, we terminated one of the two swaps and received approximately $6.6 million in the transaction. We elected to retain the other swap and therefore it effectively fixes the interest rate on $200 million out of the total $225 million of current Term Loan (for further information, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk). As of December 31, 2006, a total of $88.9 million was outstanding under the Revolver, primarily for the construction of Encore. Consequently, $811.1 million remains available under the Revolver for future borrowings for the construction of Encore or for other uses as necessary. For borrowings under the Revolver, we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1 month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.625% on the outstanding balance. After opening Encore, the margin will fluctuate between a range of 1.0% to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, an annual rate of 0.375% on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the Revolver. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Revolver will be based on our leverage ratio and will range from an annual rate of 0.25% to 0.50%. The new $900 million Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on August 15, 2011, $112.5 million of the $225 million Term Loan will be payable on September 30, 2012 and the remaining $112.5 million will be payable on August 15, 2013. The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than 48 Table of Contents Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment agreement to the lenders under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. Under that agreement, Wynn Resorts had committed to pay up to $215.3 million of Encore project costs if the Company was unable to do so. The refinancing discussed above increased the aggregate amount available under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from $1.0 billion to $1.125 billion. As a result of this increase and with other funds becoming available to pay for Encore project costs, Wynn Resorts maximum commitment to pay Encore project costs was reduced from $215.3 million to $70 million in August 2006. We also have outstanding at December 31, 2006 approximately $38.5 million of an original $44.75 million borrowing secured by our corporate aircraft. This loan matures on March 31, 2010. Principal and interest are payable quarterly, and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, we are required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft occur. Beginning December 31, 2006, we may prepay all or any portion of the loan, subject to a minimum prepayment of $10 million. On November 1, 2006, we redeemed the approximately $10.1 million of the Second Mortgage Notes that remained outstanding. Funds to repay the Second Mortgage Notes and interest had been placed in an escrow account in December 2004, specifically for this purpose. Wynn Macau Financing for Wynn Macaus design, development, construction and pre opening expenses has been provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of intercompany loans totaling $230 million, subordinated loan financing from Wynn Resorts totaling $80 million, a senior secured credit facility and cash flow from operations since opening. On October 31, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. repaid to Wynn Resorts the intercompany loan and the subordinated loan and interest using proceeds from the PBL transaction. Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior secured credit facility of $764 million includes $729.7 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156 million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2006, we had borrowed approximately $496.7 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility. The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A. satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus a margin of 2.5%. On June 22, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received consent from its lending syndicate allowing Wynn Macau, S.A. to amend certain provisions of its credit agreement to permit Wynn Macau to fund the additional $68.4 million in costs associated with three change orders to its guaranteed maximum price construction contract and other increases in Wynn Macaus project budget entirely from its existing $764 million senior secured credit facilities. The additional costs are to be incurred in connection with preparatory work for additional gaming space located in the expansion of Wynn Macaus second phase, a series of enhancements and upgrades to the overall project, and an electronic marquee sign at the entrance to Wynn Macau. Wynn Macau will fund $60.5 million of costs from its existing $72 million contingent debt facility which is included in the $729 million senior term loan facility, and $7.9 million of costs from its existing $20 million credit facility with Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. 49 Table of Contents Collateral for the Wynn Macau senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. We began to draw under the senior bank facility in October 2005, after expenditure of the intercompany loans and subordinated funding. Through December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $877.1 million of the total $1.2 billion of budgeted project costs (excluding costs for Wynn Diamond Suites). Total budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) land acquisition costs related to the additional casino expansion and capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and other costs. In addition to the above financing sources, we have $30 million of long term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau, S.A. credit facilities. See Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Special Cash Distribution On November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a special cash distribution of $6.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This special distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, we made a special payment to the holders of its Debentures so that they participated in the special distribution to the same extent as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock. We paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the special cash distribution. The total amount of the special cash distribution was $669.8 million. This special distribution was paid using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our subconcession in Macau as discussed above and corporate cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for straight forward interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4.4 million. Contractual Obligation and Commitments The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2006 (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years Total Long term debt obligations $ 6.1 $ 254.2 $ 377.3 $ 1,749.1 $ 2,386.7 Fixed interest payments 100.3 200.5 200.0 299.9 800.7 Estimated variable interest payments[1] 62.2 108.8 60.7 19.8 251.5 Operating leases 7.5 9.6 3.6 3.2 23.9 Construction contracts and commitments 122.7 36.6 159.3 Employment agreements 39.1 46.4 11.8 18.9 116.2 Other[2] 83.3 49.2 30.4 268.9 431.8 Total commitments $ 421.2 $ 705.3 $ 683.8 $ 2,359.8 $ 4,170.1 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments and LIBOR or HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2006. [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for aircraft purchases, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. 50 Table of Contents Other Liquidity Matters Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales. If completion of Encore or the second phase of Wynn Macau is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. 51 Table of Contents Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates During the construction and development of a resort, pre opening or start up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, significant start up costs were incurred and charged to pre opening costs through the second quarter of 2005 for Wynn Las Vegas and through the third quarter of 2006 for Wynn Macau, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened to the public, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts were no longer charged as pre opening costs. However, start up costs relating to Encore and the second phase of Wynn Macau will continue to be charged to pre opening costs until such projects are completed and opened. During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon the opening of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets. The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed. Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Costs of building repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss. We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2006, approximately 59% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries. 52 Table of Contents We evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy or legal system occur. Derivative Financial Instruments We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. Share Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method and use the Black Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments issued. The Black Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company. In applying the modified prospective method, financial statements of prior periods presented do not reflect any adjusted amounts (i.e. prior periods do not include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). Significant Judgmental Accruals We estimate liabilities for certain self insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes 53 Table of Contents (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Quarterly, the Company reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and when an unfavorable outcome is identified as probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company then establishes a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and may not be indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters. SFAS 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of the Companys limited operating history, we had previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, we recorded a gain on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly we determined that a substantial portion of these net deferred tax assets have become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS 109. Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5 year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2006 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $4.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and translation. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this statement is effective January 1, 2007. We have estimated that the adoption of FIN 48 will result in up to a $5 million cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet determined the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements after it is adopted on January 1, 2008. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach quantifies 54 Table of Contents misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statement whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatements year(s) of origin. Financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material. Correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended. SAB 108 is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Risks One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot be sure that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2006 on our expected long term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the one month LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2006 of 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively are used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 0.9 $ 10.0 $ 1,524.1 $ 1,537.5 Average interest rate 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 6.5 % 6.5 % Variable rate $ 5.3 $ 114.3 $ 138.2 $ 171.9 $ 194.5 $ 225.0 $ 849.2 Average interest rate 7.7 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.2 % 7.2 % 7.3 % Interest Rate Swap Information Wynn Las Vegas As of December 31, 2006, we have one interest rate swap arrangement to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $200.0 million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.875%. Under this interest rate swap arrangement, we receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on the $200 million notional amount which expires on December 31, 2008. Although this interest rate swap is highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on this borrowing under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.7%, changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps for each reporting period are, and will continue to be, recorded as an increase/(decrease) in swap fair value as the swap does not qualify for hedge accounting. Wynn Macau As of December 31, 2006, we have two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under the first swap 55 Table of Contents agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.7 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008. These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar and 50% of the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.59% and 7.52%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as an increase/(decrease) in swap fair value as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Summary of Historical Fair Values The following table presents the historical asset or (liability) fair values (reflected in deposits and other assets or in other long term liabilities as appropriate) at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands): Wynn Las Vegas Wynn Macau Total InterestRate Swap Asset/ (Liability) Asset / (liability) fair value: (amounts in thousands) at December 31, 2006 $ 4,789 $ (1,467 ) $ 3,322 at December 31, 2005 $ 10,523 $ (1,788 ) $ 8,735 The fair value approximates the amount the Company would receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Other Interest Rate Swap Information The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps, by contractual maturity dates, as of December 31, 2006 and using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ $ 538.5 $ $ $ $ $ 538.5 Average pay rate 4.4 % 4.4 % Average receive rate 4.8 % 4.8 % We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity As of December 31, 2006, approximately 87% of our long term debt was based on fixed rates, including the notional amounts related to interest rate swaps. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2006, an assumed 1% change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $3.1 million. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risks The currency delineated in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level. Because many of Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk. 57 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts. We currently own and operate Wynn Las Vegas, a destination casino resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened on April 28, 2005, and Wynn Macau, a destination casino resort in the Macau Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China (Macau), which opened on September 6, 2006. In addition, on April 28, 2006, we commenced construction of Encore at Wynn Las Vegas (Encore), a hotel casino resort which, when completed, will be fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas. We are also currently expanding Wynn Macau and in November 2006, announced Wynn Diamond Suites an additional hotel tower for Wynn Macau. Until the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, we were solely a development stage company. Our Resorts The following table sets forth information about our operating properties as of February 2007: Hotel Rooms & Suites Approximate Casino Square Footage Number of TableGames Number of Slots Wynn Las Vegas 2,716 111,000 132 1,974 Wynn Macau 600 110,000 256 477 Wynn Las Vegas We believe Wynn Las Vegas is the preeminent destination casino resort on the Strip in Las Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas features: An approximately 111,000 square foot casino offering a full range of games, including private baccarat salons, a poker room, and a race and sports book; Luxury hotel accommodations in 2,716 spacious hotel rooms, suites and villas (In 2006, the Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas became the only casino resort in the world to receive both the Mobil five star and AAA five diamond distinctions); 22 food and beverage outlets featuring signature chefs, including the AAA Five Diamond and Mobil Five Star award winning restaurant, Alex; A Ferrari and Maserati automobile dealership; Approximately 74,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Brioni, Chanel, Dior, Graff, Louis Vuitton, Jean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik; Recreation and leisure facilities, including an 18 hole golf course, five swimming pools, private cabanas and full service spa and salon; and Showroom, nightclub and lounge entertainment. The resort, which is located at the intersection of the Las Vegas Strip and Sands Avenue, occupies approximately 217 acres of land fronting the Las Vegas Strip and utilizes approximately 18 additional acres across Sands Avenue for employee parking. In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar and improved public baccarat space along with private baccarat salons, converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories 36 Table of Contents and our ladies shoe boutique in the retail esplanade. In March 2007, we intend to remodel the Le Reve Theatre, decreasing the seat count from 2,087 to 1,606 and further enhancing the guest experience. We expect the remodel effort to last approximately 30 days during which there will be no performances of Le Reve. Encore at Wynn Las Vegas We are constructing Encore on approximately 20 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, immediately adjacent to Wynn Las Vegas. Encores current plans include a 2,034 all suite hotel tower fully integrated with Wynn Las Vegas, an approximately 72,000 square foot casino, additional convention and meeting space, as well as restaurants, a nightclub, swimming pools, a spa and salon and retail outlets. We continue to refine the final design of Encore. Encore is expected to open in early 2009. Our project budget is currently estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the theatre remodeling and production of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas. The budget has increased from the previously announced $1.74 billion due to refinements in scope and market conditions for construction materials. The project budget will be funded from our existing credit facilities, remaining proceeds from the first mortgage notes and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas. To the extent additional funds are required, we will provide these amounts with additional debt and equity contributions by Wynn Resorts. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment to its bank lenders under which Wynn Resorts is obligated to pay project costs if Wynn Las Vegas is unable to. As of August 2006, Wynn Resorts obligation under the equity commitment was $70 million. On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement (the Contract) with Tutor Saliba Corporation (Tutor) for the design and construction of Encore. The Contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor will design and construct Encore. In addition to the terms and conditions governing the design and construction of Encore, the Contract provides that the parties will negotiate a guaranteed maximum price (the Encore GMP) for the construction and design of Encore within 90 days of execution of the Contract. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon a GMP during the 90 day period, the Company can, at its option, (a) continue to employ Tutor for construction and design services on a cost plus basis, (b) agree to alternative arrangements with Tutor or (c) terminate the Contract. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Contract, Tutor and the Ronald N. Tutor Separate Trust (the Trust) have entered into and consented to a Net Worth Agreement pursuant to which (x) the Trust agreed that it will retain its current majority holdings of Tutor and (y) the Trust and Tutor agreed that during the term of the Contract, Tutor will maintain (i) net worth of at least $100 million, and (ii) liquid assets of at least $50 million. Wynn Macau We opened Wynn Macau on September 6, 2006. Wynn Macau is located on 11 acres of a total site area of 16 acres of land and features: An approximately 110,000 square foot casino offering 24 hour gaming and a full range of games, including private gaming salons, approximately 256 table games and approximately 477 slot machines; Luxury hotel accommodations in 600 rooms and suites; Casual and fine dining in five restaurants; Approximately 26,000 square feet of high end, brand name retail shopping, including stores and boutiques featuring Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Dior, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Tiffany, Bulgari, Piaget and others; Recreation and leisure facilities, including a health club, pool and spa; and Entertainment lounges and meeting facilities. Construction and development continues on the second phase. This phase includes approximately 123,000 square feet of additional gaming space, a dramatic front feature attraction, a theater showroom and additional 37 Table of Contents food, beverage and retail amenities, which we expect to open in the third quarter of 2007. After the completion of the expansion, Wynn Macau is expected to have a total of approximately 420 table games and 1,280 slot machines. In addition, we continue to develop the plans and budget for the further expansion of Wynn Macau, which was first announced in November 2006. This further expansion will add a second self contained, fully integrated resort hotel named Wynn Diamond Suites, as well as gaming areas, food and beverage, retail and entertainment amenities. We continue to work on a budget and final design for Wynn Diamond Suites. We operate Wynn Macau under a 20 year casino concession agreement granted by the Macau government in June 2002. In September 2006, we sold the right to a subconcession to operate games of chance in Macau, to Publishing & Broadcasting, Ltd. (PBL) for $900 million. Cotai Development We have submitted an application to the Macau government for a concession of land in Cotai. We recently reconfigured our site plan for 52 acres and are awaiting final approval. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons: On September 11, 2006, Wynn Macau completed the sale of a Macau subconcession right and received a cash payment of $900 million. On September 6, 2006, we opened Wynn Macau and began generating operating cash flow from this project; On April 28, 2005, we opened Wynn Las Vegas and began generating operating cash flow; Prior to April 28, 2005, we were solely a development stage company; Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 include a full period of operations for Wynn Las Vegas and 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau. In contrast, the year ended December 31, 2005 includes 248 days of Wynn Las Vegas operations only. The table below displays our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands). For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 Net Revenues: Wynn Las Vegas $ 1,138,549 $ 721,981 Wynn Macau 293,708 Total Net revenues $ 1,432,257 $ 721,981 The reliance on our operating cash flow from only two properties exposes us to certain risks that competitors, whose operations are more diversified, may be better able to control. In addition to the concentration of operations in two properties, many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit, thus exposing us to increased credit risk. High end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results. Operating Measures Certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussions of the Companys operational performance for the periods presented. Casinos generally record win as a percentage of 38 Table of Contents either drop or turnover. In our casino operations at Wynn Las Vegas, table games win is recorded as a percentage of drop. However, in our casino operations at Wynn Macau, we separate table play into two distinct segments. Our Macau VIP casino segment records table games win as a percentage of turnover, whereas our general casino records win as a percentage of drop. Below are definitions of the statistics discussed: Table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue. Drop is the amount of cash or net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming tables drop box. Turnover is the sum of all losing wagers within our Wynn Macau VIP program. Slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by Wynn Las Vegas or Wynn Macau and is recorded as casino revenue. Average Daily Rate (ADR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied. Revenue per Available Room (REVPAR) is calculated by dividing total room revenue (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 are comprised of $800.6 million in casino revenues (55.9% of total net revenues) and $631.7 million of net non casino revenues (44.1% of total net revenues). Net revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 were comprised of $353.7 million in net casino revenues (49.0% of total net revenues) and $368.3 million of net non gaming revenues (51.0% of total net revenues). The quality of our resorts non gaming amenities, combined with providing guests an unparalleled total resort experience, has driven a premium in the two properties ADR and other non gaming revenues. Casino revenues are comprised of the net win from our table games and slot machine operations. Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $800.6 million, which represents approximately a $446.9 million (or 126.4%) increase from the casino revenues of $353.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in casino revenues is driven primarily by the opening of Wynn Macau in September 2006 and Wynn Las Vegas being open for all of 2006 as opposed to only 248 days in 2005. At Wynn Las Vegas, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 22.1% was within the expected range of 20% to 23% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Slot handle at Wynn Las Vegas for 2006 increased as compared to 2005, however the slot win percentage for 2006 was slightly below the expected range of 5% to 6%. Wynn Macaus win percentage for the VIP casino segment of 2.4% of turnover was below the expected range of 2.5% to 2.8%. However, turnover, the leading volume indicator in the VIP casino, met managements expectations. The average table games win percentage at the general casino at Wynn Macau of 17.1% of drop was at the lower end of the expected range of 17% to 19%, and the volume of table game play was as expected. We believe that the results of operations for the first 117 days of operations for Wynn Macau are not indicative of results to be expected in the future. We expect that over time hold percentages will normalize and that operating efficiencies will emerge. For the year ended December 31, 2006, room revenues were approximately $283.1 million, which represents a $112.8 million (or 66.2%) increase over the $170.3 million generated in the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily driven by Wynn Las Vegas being open for the 39 Table of Contents full year as opposed to 248 days of operations in 2005, as well as Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations in 2006. See the table below for key operating measures related to room revenue. For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2006 2005 Average Daily Rate Wynn Las Vegas $ 287 $ 274 Wynn Macau $ 238 N/A Occupancy Wynn Las Vegas 94.4 % 92.1 % Wynn Macau 80.6 % N/A REVPAR Wynn Las Vegas $ 271 $ 253 Wynn Macau $ 192 N/A Other non casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $309.8 million, retail revenues of approximately $87.7 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $66.3 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $51.2 million. Other non casino revenues for the 248 days of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. The additional revenue earned in Wynn Macaus 117 days of operations during 2006 contributed to the increase in the food and beverage and retail revenues. In addition, food and beverage revenues in 2006 benefited significantly from increased revenues from the nightclub located in Wynn Las Vegas as compared to the 2005 food and beverage revenues. Departmental, Administrative and Other Expenses During the year ended December 31, 2006, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $439.9 million, rooms expenses of $73.9 million, food and beverage expenses of $194.4 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $134.5 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $231.5 million and approximately $21.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2005, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, room expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. The increase in expenses is due primarily to the inclusion of 117 days of the operations of Wynn Macau and increases in Wynn Las Vegas expenses commensurate with the increase in revenues. In addition, on January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payments, using the modified prospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $15.4 million of share based compensation expense which is included in the department of the recipient of the stock based award. Prior to January 1, 2006, we did not recognize expense for employee stock options that were granted at the market price. See our Consolidated Financial Statements Note 15 for more information. Pre opening costs Pre opening costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $62.7 million compared to $96.9 million for the prior year. Wynn Macau, which opened on September 6, 2006, accounted for $60.5 million of the current year pre opening costs while the balance relates primarily to Encore. Pre opening costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 related primarily to Wynn Las Vegas which opened on April 28, 2005 and Wynn Macau. We 40 Table of Contents expect that Wynn Macaus pre opening expenses will continue during 2007, although at lesser amounts, as construction and development of the second phase continues toward the expected completion in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, as Encore progresses, pre opening expenses related to this project will increase as the opening approaches. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $175.5 million increased by $72.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to including a full year for Wynn Las Vegas and an additional 117 days of operations of Wynn Macau. Wynn Las Vegas only recorded 248 days of depreciation in 2005. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession, which currently expire in June 2022 and 2029, respectively. Consequently, depreciation for long lived assets related to Wynn Macau is charged generally over shorter useful lives when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once these properties opened, their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. Contract Termination Fee In February 2006, we agreed with the producers of Avenue Q to end Avenue Qs exclusive Las Vegas run at Wynn Las Vegas Broadway Theatre at the end of May 2006. To terminate the contract, we paid a termination fee of $5 million. This fee was recorded in the first quarter of 2006. We have remodeled the Broadway Theater and adjacent areas in anticipation of commencing performances of Monty Pythons Spamalot in the first quarter of 2007. Property charges and other Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $25.1 million increased by $10.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. In response to our evaluation of the completed Wynn Las Vegas project and the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005 which continued throughout 2006. Costs relating to assets retired as a result of these enhancements and remodel efforts for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $14.4 million have been expensed as property charges. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we remodeled the six North Fairway Villas, several areas of the retail promenade, a portion of the baccarat area to feature a casino bar, improved public baccarat space and private baccarat salons, converted the Keno lounge to a retail outlet for womens accessories, and remodeled our ladies shoe boutique in the retail esplanade. In March 2007, we intend to remodel the Le Reve Theatre, decreasing the seat count from 2,087 to 1,606 and further enhancing the guest experience. We expect the remodel effort to last approximately 30 days during which time there will be no performances of Le Reve. Although Wynn Las Vegas property charges have decreased in recent quarters, we expect that enhancements and refinements to Wynn Macau will take place in response to reactions from our customers in that market. Accordingly, we expect that Company property charges may increase in future periods. In December 2006, Wynn Macau donated an early Ming dynasty vase to the Macau Museum. We purchased the vase in May 2006 for approximately $10.1 million. The vase had been on public display at Wynn Macau 41 Table of Contents prior to its donation to the museum. The $10.1 million expense for the donation of the Ming Vase is included in Property charges and other for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income of $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $18.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances compared to 2005, as well as interest earned on the PBL proceeds. Interest expense, net of capitalized interest of $29.5 million was $148.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $102.7 million, net of capitalized interest of $50.0 million for the same period in 2005. This increase is due to the increase in our borrowings in Macau, slightly higher interest rates and the $20.5 million decrease in interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened. Our interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS 133). On August 15, 2006, concurrent with the refinancing of Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities), we terminated a $200 million notional amount interest rate swap relating to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs senior credit facilities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded as non operating income or expense in each period. We recorded approximately $1.2 million of interest rate swap income for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 (December 31, 2005 to August 15, 2006 in the case of the terminated swap). During the year ended December 31, 2005 we recorded a gain of $8.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps between December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005. For further information on our interest rate swaps, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Loss from extinguishment of debt totaled $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. On August 15, 2006 we refinanced our Wynn Las Vegas senior credit facilities as discussed in further detail below (See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities). As a result of the refinancing and resulting modification of the Term Loan, we recorded a loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately $10.8 million to reflect the write off of the previous Term Loans unamortized deferred financing costs. In addition, on November 1, 2006, we redeemed the remaining approximate $10.1 million of our Second Mortgage Notes and incurred a $1.7 million redemption premium which is also included as loss from extinguishment of debt. On November 13, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors declared a special one time cash distribution of $6.00 per share on its outstanding common stock. This special one time distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, the Company made a special payment to the holders of its Debentures so that they participated in the special distribution as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock prior to the record date. The Company paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount, or $58.5 million in total. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the special cash distribution. The payment was recorded as a distribution to convertible debenture holders in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gain on sale of subconcession right On March 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement with PBL pursuant to which we agreed to sell to PBL for $900 million, the right to negotiate with the government of Macau for a subconcession to allow PBL to operate casinos in Macau. 42 Table of Contents On September 8, 2006, the government of Macau approved the subconcession and on September 11, 2006, PBL paid $900 million in cash to Wynn Macau, S.A. for the subconcession right. As a result of the sale and the subconcession awarded to PBL by the government of Macau, we have no continuing rights or obligations with respect to the subconcession. All rights and obligations under the subconcession are between PBL and the government of Macau. The proceeds from this sale, net of related costs, are recorded as gain on sale of subconcession right, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2006, our effective tax rate was approximately 21.3%. This rate was lower than the federal statutory rate due to the reduction of our valuation allowance in connection with the sale of the PBL subconcession right and a reduced effective tax rate on our foreign operations (see footnote 17 Income Taxes). Their were no comparable items in 2004 and 2005 as we had not yet reached a conclusion that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets were realizable. Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5 year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, we were exempted from the payment of approximately $4.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 248 days of operations at Wynn Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2005 have no comparisons to 2004 as we were solely a development stage company prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Revenues Wynn Las Vegas net gaming revenues were $353.7 million for the 248 days of operations during the year ended December 31, 2005. During that period, the average table games win percentage (before discounts) of 21.5% was within the expected range of 18% to 22%, and the slot win percentage was within the expected range of 5% to 6% of handle. For the 248 days of operations in 2005, Wynn Las Vegas gross room revenues were approximately $170.3 million. ADR and occupancy for that period were $274 and 92.1%, respectively, generating REVPAR of $253. Other non gaming revenues included food and beverage revenues of approximately $173.7 million, retail revenues of approximately $51.2 million, entertainment revenues of approximately $41.8 million, and other revenues from outlets, including the spa and salon, of approximately $32.2 million. Departmental, Administrative, and Other Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2005, departmental expenses included casino expenses of $155.1 million, rooms expenses of $44.2 million, food and beverage expenses of $118.7 million, and entertainment, retail and other expenses of $80.2 million. Also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately $119.0 million and approximately $16.2 million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable. At opening, Wynn Las Vegas employed approximately 9,200 persons to accommodate increased opening needs. Natural staffing attrition reduced the number of employees at the end of 2005 to approximately 8,900 persons. Pre opening costs Pre opening costs were $96.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Pre opening costs related to our Wynn Las Vegas project were $67.5 43 Table of Contents million and $41.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The large amount of pre opening costs incurred in 2005 was due primarily to the substantial increase in staffing preceding the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. Pre opening costs related to our Wynn Macau project were $20.4 million and $16.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Wynn Macaus pre opening costs continued to increase through the opening in the third quarter of 2006. Included in pre opening costs are corporate costs of $9.1 million and $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. After Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, such corporate expenses were charged to general and administrative expense instead of pre opening. Corporate staffing and related costs did not increase significantly immediately before or after opening of Wynn Las Vegas; instead, the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to having a 117 day pre opening period in 2005, compared with a 365 day pre opening period in 2004. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $103.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is primarily due to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005. During the construction of Wynn Las Vegas, costs incurred in the construction of the buildings, improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized. Once Wynn Las Vegas opened and these assets were placed into service, we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense. The depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets. In addition, we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment, intangibles and other assets. When circumstances require a revision to those estimates of useful life, we adjust them accordingly. Property charges and other In response to our evaluation of the finished product and in response to the reactions of our guests, we began to make enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the total $14.3 million for Wynn Las Vegas property charges and other for 2005 are approximately $9.4 million of costs relating to assets retired as a result of the remodel efforts at Wynn Las Vegas, and approximately $3.1 million of expenses relating to the abandonment of improvements made to the temporary offices utilized during part of the construction and development of the resort. Once we decided to remodel the Broadway Theater to present Spamalot, we also wrote off approximately $1.6 million of costs incurred in 2005 in connection with the preliminary design and development of a third theater originally planned to house Monty Pythons Spamalot, and later abandoned. There were no comparable Wynn Las Vegas property charges incurred during 2004. Property charges in 2004 instead reflect net losses on ordinary asset sales, including an aircraft sold in 2004 at a loss of approximately $550,000. Other non operating costs and expenses Interest and other income increased by $19.6 million for 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is due primarily to the significant increase in the amount of average cash balances available and invested from the remaining proceeds of our 6 5/8% First Mortgage Notes due 2014 (the First Mortgage Notes) and borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas, LLC credit facilities that were invested during 2005, compared to 2004. Interest expense, net, increased by $100.0 million for 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to the significant decrease in the amount of interest capitalized once Wynn Las Vegas opened, plus the increase in the long term debt resulting from our December 2004 refinancing and credit facility borrowings during 2005. We seek to manage the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings supplemented by the use of derivative financial instruments as required or considered necessary. We were required to, and did obtain through interest rate swap arrangements, interest 44 Table of Contents rate protection for portions of our borrowings under our credit facilities. These interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an increase in swap fair value of approximately $8.2 million resulting from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Also during 2004, we recorded a $122.8 million loss from extinguishment of debt related to the early retirement of the majority of the original $370.0 million of 12% Second Mortgage Notes due 2010 (the Second Mortgage Notes). This loss resulted from the write off of associated deferred financing costs and original issue discount, as well as a 12% redemption premium, on the Second Mortgage Notes. We repurchased the remaining principal amount of the Second Mortgage Notes totaling approximately $10.1 million on November 1, 2006 (the first available call date), at which time an additional loss of $1.7 million was recorded to reflect the redemption premium and write off of the remaining financing costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow from Operations Our operating cash flows are primarily affected by our operating income generated by Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, interest paid, and non cash charges included in operating income. Net cash from operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $240.8 million compared to $48.5 million provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Prior to the opening of Wynn Las Vegas on April 28, 2005, we were solely a development stage company and did not generate operational cash flow. Capital Resources We require a certain amount of cash on hand for operations. Our cash balances at December 31, 2006, were higher than in prior periods due to the opening of Wynn Macau and approximately $517 million remaining from the $900 million cash received from PBL on September 11, 2006. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $789.4 million of cash and cash equivalents available for new development activities, general corporate purposes, enhancements to Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, and to support the development and construction of Encore and the second phase of Wynn Macau. Of this amount, approximately $54.7 million is held by Wynn Resorts, Limited, which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. However, Wynn Resorts, Limited has provided an equity commitment agreement to Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs secured lenders, which obligates Wynn Resorts, Limited to contribute up to $70 million for Encore project costs if Wynn Las Vegas, LLC is unable to pay such costs. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $237.4 million in cash and investments from the proceeds of our debt and equity financings, which is restricted for the following: Construction, development and pre opening expenses of Encore; Construction, development and pre opening expenses of the second phase of Wynn Macau; Remaining costs to be paid in relation to Wynn Macaus first phase; $30 million of contingent equity restricted for Wynn Macau; $80 million restricted for the Wynn Las Vegas liquidity reserve and completion guarantee ($30 million of which must be retained for Encore); and Remaining costs for completion of Wynn Las Vegas, estimated to be approximately $3.2 million. Cash equivalents include investments in overnight money market funds. Restricted investments are kept in money market funds or relatively short term, government backed, marketable debt securities as required by agreements governing our debt facilities. 45 Table of Contents Investing Activities Encore at Wynn Las Vegas On April 28, 2006, we commenced construction on Encore. We expect to open Encore to the public in early 2009. Design and construction is progressing as expected at Encore. Current construction activities in the various project sections since groundbreaking include the following: The high rise concrete pours have been completed through the 15th floor deck. The installation of the reinforcing rebar for the shear walls and columns for the 16h floor is underway. Construction of the guest self park garage has reached level 6 with beams and deck forms installed. Low rise excavation is complete with the exception of the pool deck which has just begun. The footings for the main casino area are 95% complete. The employee parking garage located on our Koval property is complete and in use. Our project budget is currently estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of approximately $2.0 billion for Encore and approximately $100 million for an employee parking garage on our Koval property, an associated pedestrian bridge and costs incurred in connection with the theatre remodeling and production of Monty Pythons Spamalot at Wynn Las Vegas. The budget has increased from the previously announced $1.74 billion due to refinements in scope and market conditions for construction materials. The project budget will be funded from our existing credit facilities, remaining proceeds from the first mortgage notes and operating cash flow from Wynn Las Vegas. To the extent additional funds are required, we will provide these amounts with additional debt and equity contributions by Wynn Resorts. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment to its bank lenders under which Wynn Resorts is obligated to pay project costs if Wynn Las Vegas is unable to. As of August 2006, Wynn Resorts obligation under the equity commitment was $70 million. On February 27, 2007, we entered into a Design Build Architectural, Engineering and Construction Services Agreement (the Contract) with Tutor Saliba Corporation (Tutor) for the design and construction of Encore. The Contract sets forth all of the terms and conditions pursuant to which Tutor will design and construct Encore. In addition to the terms and conditions governing the design and construction of Encore, the Contract provides that the parties will negotiate a guaranteed maximum price (the Encore GMP) for the construction and design of Encore within 90 days of execution of the Contract. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon a GMP during the 90 day period, the Company can, at its option, (a) continue to employ Tutor for construction and design services on a cost plus basis, (b) agree to alternative arrangements with Tutor or (c) terminate the Contract. In connection with the execution and delivery of the Contract, Tutor and the Ronald N. Tutor Separate Trust (the Trust) have entered into and consented to a Net Worth Agreement pursuant to which (x) the Trust agreed that it will retain its current majority holdings of Tutor and (y) the Trust and Tutor agreed that during the term of the Contract, Tutor will maintain (i) net worth of at least $100 million, and (ii) liquid assets of at least $50 million. As of December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $277.6 million of project costs related to the development and construction of Encore and related capital improvements. These costs, net of approximately $8.1 million of retention, have been funded from the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, the remaining funds from the First Mortgage Notes and cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas. Prior to signing a guaranteed maximum price construction contract, we are permitted to spend up to $300 million of the proceeds of the First Mortgage Notes and the credit facilities on Encore project costs. As of December 31, 2006, we have spent or committed approximately $206.3 million using these debt proceeds. The remaining $63.2 million has been funded from cash flows from operations. The ongoing costs of Encore will be paid with funds from the following sources and in the following order of priority: First, by using agreed amounts of excess cash flow from the operations of Wynn Las Vegas and any equity contributions from Wynn Resorts; 46 Table of Contents Second, by using any proceeds from the First Mortgage Notes (including any additional First Mortgage Notes that may be issued in the future), and the proceeds of borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, until exhaustion of the First Mortgage Notes proceeds, with amounts funded 66.67% from notes proceeds and 33.33% from the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities; Third, by using proceeds of additional borrowings under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities and; Fourth, by using the funds from the completion guarantee deposit account. Wynn Las Vegas In the third quarter of 2005, we began to make certain enhancements and refinements to Wynn Las Vegas. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures relating to these enhancements and refinements. Under the terms of the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities, we were permitted to make up to $100 million of capital expenditures in 2006, of which we have expended approximately $52.8 million. For 2007, we will be permitted to spend $172.2 million including $47.2 million which is carried forward from 2006. The spending limit will be increased to the extent funds are contributed to Wynn Las Vegas by Wynn Resorts, Limited. Le Reve Production Rights On May 31, 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all intellectual property rights related to Le Reve, which were previously only licensed to us. We paid $15.9 million to acquire substantially all of the rights in and to Le Reve, and to repay approximately $1.4 million of production costs, which were reimbursable to the executive producer of Le Reve. The rights acquired enable us to produce, present, enhance, or alter the performance of Le Reve after May 31, 2006. Wynn Macau The first phase of Wynn Macau was completed, and the casino resort opened, on September 6, 2006. The construction of the second phase is progressing and is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2007. The overall Wynn Macau project remains within budget and the second phase is progressing according to the expected timeframe. Significant construction accomplishments for the second phase include: Completion of the building sub structure (i.e. below ground pilings and footings) and above ground super structure; Completion of the external walls and roof; Steady progress of the interior fit out and mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems; and Occupation by Permit for certain portions of the ground floor public space. The current total project budget for Wynn Macau (excluding the developing budget for Wynn Diamond Suites and related amenities) is approximately $1.2 billion, including contingencies, but excluding up to $20.5 million of post opening land concession payments anticipated to be funded from operating cash flows. Under the Amended and Restated Construction Contract, the general contractor is responsible for both the construction and design of the project (other than certain limited portions to be designed by one of our subsidiaries) based on an existing scope of work and design specifications for both the first phase and the expansion as provided by us, for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately $484 million (including the contractors fee and contingency). On June 22, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received consent from its lending syndicate permitting Wynn Macau, S.A. to enter into three change orders to its guaranteed maximum price construction contract. The three change orders implement a series of amendments to the Construction Contract including, providing for the completion of the majority of the first floor of the Wynn Macau expansion as additional gaming space, a series of 47 Table of Contents enhancements and upgrades to the overall project, and adding an electronic marquee sign at the entrance to Wynn Macau. The change orders increased the guaranteed maximum price under the Construction Contract from $457 million to approximately $484 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has incurred approximately $877.1 million of the total project budget (excluding Wynn Diamond Suites) of approximately $1.2 billion. Financing Activities Wynn Las Vegas and Encore On August 15, 2006, we refinanced our Revolving Credit Facility (the Revolver) and our Delay Draw Term Loan Facility (the Term Loan)(together, the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities). On August 15, 2006, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) which, among other things, (i) increased the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from $1.0 billion to $1.125 billion by increasing the Revolver from $600 million to $900 million and reducing the Term Loan from $400 million to $225 million; (ii) reduced the borrowing margins on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) based Revolver and Term Loan to 1.625% and 1.875%, respectively; (iii) extended the maturity dates for the Revolver and the Term Loans to 2011 and 2013, respectively; and (iv) reduced the consolidated interest coverage ratio requirement for quarterly periods on or prior to December 31, 2007 to 2.00:1. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also: (i) reduced the range of the Revolvers annual LIBOR borrowing margin after the opening of Encore from a range of 1.25% to 2.50% to a range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio; and (ii) simplified the procedures for and conditions to obtaining advances and reduced the reporting obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including fully utilizing all previously funded amounts under the First Mortgage Notes for payment of Encore project costs. As a result of the refinancing discussed above, borrowings under the Term Loan were reduced to $225 million, under which we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans which bear interest at 1 month LIBOR and include a margin of 1.875% on that outstanding balance. We had two $200 million notional amount interest rate swaps to essentially fix the interest on the $400 million of former Term Loan. When we completed the refinancing on August 15, 2006, we terminated one of the two swaps and received approximately $6.6 million in the transaction. We elected to retain the other swap and therefore it effectively fixes the interest rate on $200 million out of the total $225 million of current Term Loan (for further information, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussions about Market Risk). As of December 31, 2006, a total of $88.9 million was outstanding under the Revolver, primarily for the construction of Encore. Consequently, $811.1 million remains available under the Revolver for future borrowings for the construction of Encore or for other uses as necessary. For borrowings under the Revolver, we have elected, and expect to continue to elect, Eurodollar loans, which bear interest at 1 month LIBOR and currently include a margin of 1.625% on the outstanding balance. After opening Encore, the margin will fluctuate between a range of 1.0% to 1.75%, depending on our leverage ratio. In addition to interest, we also pay quarterly in arrears, an annual rate of 0.375% on the daily average of unborrowed availability under the Revolver. After the opening of Encore, the annual fee that we will be required to pay for unborrowed availability under the Revolver will be based on our leverage ratio and will range from an annual rate of 0.25% to 0.50%. The new $900 million Revolver will terminate and be payable in full on August 15, 2011, $112.5 million of the $225 million Term Loan will be payable on September 30, 2012 and the remaining $112.5 million will be payable on August 15, 2013. The Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities are obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and are guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets (except the corporate aircraft) of each of its subsidiaries (other than 48 Table of Contents Wynn Completion Guarantor, LLC). The obligations of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and the guarantors under the Credit Facilities rank pari passu in right of payment with their existing and future senior indebtedness, including indebtedness with respect to the First Mortgage Notes and senior in right of payment to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness. On March 31, 2006, Wynn Resorts delivered an equity commitment agreement to the lenders under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities. Under that agreement, Wynn Resorts had committed to pay up to $215.3 million of Encore project costs if the Company was unable to do so. The refinancing discussed above increased the aggregate amount available under the Wynn Las Vegas Credit Facilities from $1.0 billion to $1.125 billion. As a result of this increase and with other funds becoming available to pay for Encore project costs, Wynn Resorts maximum commitment to pay Encore project costs was reduced from $215.3 million to $70 million in August 2006. We also have outstanding at December 31, 2006 approximately $38.5 million of an original $44.75 million borrowing secured by our corporate aircraft. This loan matures on March 31, 2010. Principal and interest are payable quarterly, and interest is calculated at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.375%. In addition to scheduled amortization payments, we are required to prepay the loans if certain events of loss with respect to the aircraft occur. Beginning December 31, 2006, we may prepay all or any portion of the loan, subject to a minimum prepayment of $10 million. On November 1, 2006, we redeemed the approximately $10.1 million of the Second Mortgage Notes that remained outstanding. Funds to repay the Second Mortgage Notes and interest had been placed in an escrow account in December 2004, specifically for this purpose. Wynn Macau Financing for Wynn Macaus design, development, construction and pre opening expenses has been provided by a combination of cash on hand in the form of intercompany loans totaling $230 million, subordinated loan financing from Wynn Resorts totaling $80 million, a senior secured credit facility and cash flow from operations since opening. On October 31, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. repaid to Wynn Resorts the intercompany loan and the subordinated loan and interest using proceeds from the PBL transaction. Wynn Macau, S.A.s senior secured credit facility of $764 million includes $729.7 million of senior term loan facilities, a HK$117 million revolving credit facility (approximately US$15 million), and an additional term loan facility of HK$156 million (approximately US$20 million). As of December 31, 2006, we had borrowed approximately $496.7 million under the Wynn Macau, S.A. senior secured credit facility. The term loan facilities mature in September 2011, and the revolving credit facility matures in September 2007. The principal amount of the term loans is required to be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing on March 14, 2008. The term loans bear interest at LIBOR or the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) plus a margin of 2.75%. The senior bank facility also provides for further reductions in the margin on the term loans if Wynn Macau, S.A. satisfies certain prescribed leverage ratio tests. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at HIBOR plus a margin of 2.5%. On June 22, 2006, Wynn Macau, S.A. received consent from its lending syndicate allowing Wynn Macau, S.A. to amend certain provisions of its credit agreement to permit Wynn Macau to fund the additional $68.4 million in costs associated with three change orders to its guaranteed maximum price construction contract and other increases in Wynn Macaus project budget entirely from its existing $764 million senior secured credit facilities. The additional costs are to be incurred in connection with preparatory work for additional gaming space located in the expansion of Wynn Macaus second phase, a series of enhancements and upgrades to the overall project, and an electronic marquee sign at the entrance to Wynn Macau. Wynn Macau will fund $60.5 million of costs from its existing $72 million contingent debt facility which is included in the $729 million senior term loan facility, and $7.9 million of costs from its existing $20 million credit facility with Banco Nacional Ultramarino, S.A. 49 Table of Contents Collateral for the Wynn Macau senior bank facility consists of substantially all of the assets of Wynn Macau, S.A. Certain affiliates that own interests in Wynn Macau, S.A., either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, have executed guarantees of the loans and pledged their interests in Wynn Macau, S.A. as additional security for repayment of the loans. We began to draw under the senior bank facility in October 2005, after expenditure of the intercompany loans and subordinated funding. Through December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $877.1 million of the total $1.2 billion of budgeted project costs (excluding costs for Wynn Diamond Suites). Total budgeted project costs include construction and design costs (including construction contingencies) land acquisition costs related to the additional casino expansion and capitalized interest, pre opening expenses, financing fees and other costs. In addition to the above financing sources, we have $30 million of long term restricted cash reserved as contingent equity. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under the Wynn Macau, S.A. credit facilities. See Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Special Cash Distribution On November 13, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a special cash distribution of $6.00 per share on our outstanding common stock. This special distribution was paid on December 4, 2006, to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2006. As part of this distribution, we made a special payment to the holders of its Debentures so that they participated in the special distribution to the same extent as if they had converted their Debentures to common stock. We paid holders of the Debentures a cash amount equal to $260.87 per $1,000 principal amount. In accordance with the indenture governing the Debentures, as a result of the payment, no adjustment was made to the conversion price as a result of the special cash distribution. The total amount of the special cash distribution was $669.8 million. This special distribution was paid using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our subconcession in Macau as discussed above and corporate cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for straight forward interest rate swaps. We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4.4 million. Contractual Obligation and Commitments The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments at December 31, 2006 (amounts in millions): Payments Due By Period Less Than1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years Total Long term debt obligations $ 6.1 $ 254.2 $ 377.3 $ 1,749.1 $ 2,386.7 Fixed interest payments 100.3 200.5 200.0 299.9 800.7 Estimated variable interest payments[1] 62.2 108.8 60.7 19.8 251.5 Operating leases 7.5 9.6 3.6 3.2 23.9 Construction contracts and commitments 122.7 36.6 159.3 Employment agreements 39.1 46.4 11.8 18.9 116.2 Other[2] 83.3 49.2 30.4 268.9 431.8 Total commitments $ 421.2 $ 705.3 $ 683.8 $ 2,359.8 $ 4,170.1 [1] Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon currently existing commitments and LIBOR or HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2006. [2] Other includes open purchase orders, commitments for aircraft purchases, land concession and fixed gaming tax payments in Macau and other contracts. 50 Table of Contents Other Liquidity Matters Wynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its subsidiaries ability to provide funds to it. Restrictions imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments significantly restrict certain key subsidiaries holding a majority of our assets, including Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A., from making dividends or distributions to us. Specifically, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture governing the First Mortgage Notes from making certain restricted payments as defined in the indenture. These restricted payments include the payment of dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect holders of equity interests of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC. These restricted payments may not be made unless certain financial and non financial criteria have been satisfied. The other credit facilities of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Macau, S.A. contain similar restrictions; although the Wynn Macau, S.A. loan agreements permit distribution of the net proceeds of subconcession sales. If completion of Encore or the second phase of Wynn Macau is delayed, then our debt service obligations accruing prior to the actual opening will increase correspondingly. Wynn Las Vegas will fund its operations and capital requirements from operating cash flow and remaining availability under Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs credit facilities. We cannot assure you, however, that Wynn Las Vegas will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings available to us under the Wynn Las Vegas credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLCs indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Similarly, we expect that Wynn Macau will fund Wynn Macau, S.A.s debt service obligations with operating cash flow and remaining availability under its senior secured bank facility. However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows and available borrowings will be sufficient to do so. We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in Las Vegas, as well as other domestic or international markets. There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. Any other development would require us to obtain additional financing. We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau related entities. Wynn Resorts articles of incorporation provide that Wynn Resorts may redeem shares of its capital stock, including its common stock, that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates to the extent a gaming authority makes a determination of unsuitability and orders the redemption, or to the extent deemed necessary or advisable by our Board of Directors. The redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note or both, as required by the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as we elect. Any promissory note that we issue to an unsuitable person or its affiliate in exchange for its shares could increase our debt to equity ratio and will increase our leverage ratio. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting policies require that management apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty rewards, self insurance, contingencies, litigation and other items. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates. 51 Table of Contents Development, Construction and Property and Equipment Estimates During the construction and development of a resort, pre opening or start up costs are expensed when incurred. In connection with the construction and development of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, significant start up costs were incurred and charged to pre opening costs through the second quarter of 2005 for Wynn Las Vegas and through the third quarter of 2006 for Wynn Macau, as anticipated. Once Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau opened to the public, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts were no longer charged as pre opening costs. However, start up costs relating to Encore and the second phase of Wynn Macau will continue to be charged to pre opening costs until such projects are completed and opened. During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are put in service. Accordingly, upon the opening of Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Macau, we began recognizing depreciation expense on the resorts fixed assets. The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed. Our leasehold interest in land in Macau under the land concession contract entered into in June 2004 is being amortized over 25 years, to reflect the initial term of the concession contract, which currently terminates in June 2029. Depreciation on the majority of the assets comprising Wynn Macau, however, commenced in September of 2006, when Wynn Macau opened. The maximum useful life of assets at Wynn Macau is the remaining life of the gaming concession, which currently expires in June 2022. Consequently, depreciation related to Wynn Macau will generally be charged over shorter periods when compared to Wynn Las Vegas. Costs of building repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operating income or loss. We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses. Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts Receivable A substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. Credit play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Wynn Las Vegas. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. At December 31, 2006, approximately 59% of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries. The collectibility of markers given by foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers home countries. 52 Table of Contents We evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as managements prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts charge may fluctuate. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a regions economy or legal system occur. Derivative Financial Instruments We seek to manage our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) as applicable. Share Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. We adopted this statement on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective method and use the Black Scholes valuation model to value the equity instruments issued. The Black Scholes valuation model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company. In applying the modified prospective method, financial statements of prior periods presented do not reflect any adjusted amounts (i.e. prior periods do not include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method). In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, Share Based Payment to provide interpretive guidance on SFAS No. 123(R) valuation methods, assumptions used in valuation models, and the interaction of SFAS No. 123(R) with existing SEC guidance. SAB No. 107 also requires the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses). Significant Judgmental Accruals We estimate liabilities for certain self insurance, customer loyalty program reward redemptions, contingencies, claims and litigation and other items, as appropriate. Management determines the adequacy of these estimates by reviewing the expected trends and from industry experience and adjusts the assumptions utilized as necessary. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes 53 Table of Contents (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in the locations where it operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Quarterly, the Company reviews any potentially unfavorable tax outcome and when an unfavorable outcome is identified as probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company then establishes a tax reserve for such possible unfavorable outcome. Estimating potential tax outcomes for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and may not be indicative of the ultimate settlement with the tax authorities. The Company believes that it has adequately provided reasonable reserves for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters. SFAS 109 requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. During our development stage, we accumulated significant net operating losses, which generated significant deferred tax assets. Because of the Companys limited operating history, we had previously fully reserved these net deferred tax assets. On September 11, 2006, we recorded a gain on the sale of the subconcession right. Accordingly we determined that a substantial portion of these net deferred tax assets have become more likely than not realizable as defined by SFAS 109. Effective September 6, 2006, we received a 5 year exemption from Macaus 12% Complementary Tax on casino gaming profits. Accordingly, during 2006 we were exempted from the payment of approximately $4.7 million in such taxes. Wynn Macaus non gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and Wynn Macaus casino winnings remain subject to the Macau Special Gaming tax and other levies in accordance with its concession agreement. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and translation. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of this statement is effective January 1, 2007. We have estimated that the adoption of FIN 48 will result in up to a $5 million cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No 157, Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet determined the impact this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements after it is adopted on January 1, 2008. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach quantifies 54 Table of Contents misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statement whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatements year(s) of origin. Financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material. Correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended. SAB 108 is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Risks One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings supplemented by hedging activities as considered necessary. We cannot be sure that these risk management strategies will have the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments at December 31, 2006 on our expected long term indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Accordingly, the one month LIBOR and HIBOR rates at December 31, 2006 of 5.3% and 3.9%, respectively are used for all calculations in the table below. As of December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.9 $ 0.9 $ 10.0 $ 1,524.1 $ 1,537.5 Average interest rate 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % 6.5 % 6.5 % Variable rate $ 5.3 $ 114.3 $ 138.2 $ 171.9 $ 194.5 $ 225.0 $ 849.2 Average interest rate 7.7 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.2 % 7.2 % 7.3 % Interest Rate Swap Information Wynn Las Vegas As of December 31, 2006, we have one interest rate swap arrangement to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of $200.0 million of borrowings under the current Wynn Las Vegas, LLC term loan facility, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.875%. Under this interest rate swap arrangement, we receive payments at a variable rate of LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of 3.793% on the $200 million notional amount which expires on December 31, 2008. Although this interest rate swap is highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on this borrowing under the new term loan facility at approximately 5.7%, changes in fair value of our interest rate swaps for each reporting period are, and will continue to be, recorded as an increase/(decrease) in swap fair value as the swap does not qualify for hedge accounting. Wynn Macau As of December 31, 2006, we have two interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the underlying interest rate risk on borrowings under Wynn Macau S.A.s $749 million senior term loan facility. Under the first swap 55 Table of Contents agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.84% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately $198.2 million, in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR at the time of payment. Under the second swap agreement, we pay a fixed interest rate of 4.77% on borrowings estimated to be incurred under the senior term loan facility up to a maximum of approximately HK$1.1 billion (approximately US$140.7 million), in exchange for receipts on the same amounts at a variable interest rate based on the applicable HIBOR at the time of payment. The term of both swap agreements is from November 28, 2005 through November 28, 2008. These interest rate swaps are expected to be highly effective in fixing the interest rate on 50% of the US dollar and 50% of the Hong Kong dollar borrowings under the senior bank facility at approximately 7.59% and 7.52%, respectively. However, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps for each reporting period recorded are, and will continue to be, recognized as an increase/(decrease) in swap fair value as the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting. Summary of Historical Fair Values The following table presents the historical asset or (liability) fair values (reflected in deposits and other assets or in other long term liabilities as appropriate) at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (amounts in thousands): Wynn Las Vegas Wynn Macau Total InterestRate Swap Asset/ (Liability) Asset / (liability) fair value: (amounts in thousands) at December 31, 2006 $ 4,789 $ (1,467 ) $ 3,322 at December 31, 2005 $ 10,523 $ (1,788 ) $ 8,735 The fair value approximates the amount the Company would receive if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. Fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore, is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. Other Interest Rate Swap Information The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps, by contractual maturity dates, as of December 31, 2006 and using estimated future LIBOR and HIBOR rates based upon implied forward rates in the yield curve: Expected Averages as of December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (in millions) Average notional amount $ $ 538.5 $ $ $ $ $ 538.5 Average pay rate 4.4 % 4.4 % Average receive rate 4.8 % 4.8 % We do not use derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity As of December 31, 2006, approximately 87% of our long term debt was based on fixed rates, including the notional amounts related to interest rate swaps. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2006, an assumed 1% change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $3.1 million. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risks The currency delineated in Wynn Macaus concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments. If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level. Because many of Wynn Macaus payment and expenditure obligations are in Macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable Macau pataca or Hong Kong dollar rate changes, Wynn Macaus obligations, as denominated in U.S. dollars, would increase. In addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that Wynn Macau operates in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar. Also, if any of our Macau related entities incur U.S. dollar denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on Wynn Macaus ability to service its debt, its results of operations and its financial condition. We have not yet determined whether we will engage in hedging activities to protect against foreign currency risk. 57 Table of Contents
