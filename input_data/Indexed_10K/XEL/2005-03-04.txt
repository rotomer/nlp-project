Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy), a Minnesota corporation, is a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). In 2004, Xcel Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These utility subsidiaries are Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation (NSP Minnesota); Northern States Power Co., a Wisconsin corporation (NSP Wisconsin); Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) and Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS). These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WestGas InterState Inc. (WGI), an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies comprise our continuing regulated utility operations. Discontinued utility operations include the activity of Viking Gas Transmission Co. (Viking), an interstate natural gas pipeline company that was sold in January 2003; Black Mountain Gas Co. (BMG), a regulated natural gas and propane distribution company that was sold in October 2003; and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. (Cheyenne), a regulated electric and natural gas utility that was sold in January 2005. Xcel Energys nonregulated subsidiaries in continuing operations include Utility Engineering Corp. (engineering, construction and design) and Eloigne Co. (investments in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax credits). During 2003, Planergy International, Inc. (energy management solutions) closed and began selling a majority of its business operations with final dissolution occurring in 2004. On March 2, 2005, Xcel Energy agreed to sell its non regulated subsidiary UE to Zachry Group, Inc. Zachry agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of UE, including three UE subsidiaries: Precision Resource Co., a professional staffing company; Proto Power Corp., an engineering and project management company dedicated to the nuclear power industry; and Universal Utility Services, LLC, a full service industrial maintenance group. Quixx Corp., a subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects is not included in the transaction. Xcel Energy expects to record a small loss as a result of the transaction; however, the transaction is not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition of Xcel Energy. The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions as to closing and is expected to be completed in April 2005. During 2004, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to pursue the sale of Seren Innovations, Inc. (Seren), a broadband communications services company. During 2003, Xcel Energy also divested its ownership interest in NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG), an independent power producer. On May 14, 2003, NRG filed for bankruptcy to restructure its debt. As a result of the reorganization, Xcel Energy relinquished its ownership interest in NRG. During 2003, the board of directors of Xcel Energy also approved managements plan to exit businesses conducted by the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International Inc. (Xcel Energy International), an international independent power producer, operating primarily in Argentina and e prime inc. (e prime), a natural gas marketing and trading company. NRG, Xcel Energy International, e prime and Seren are presented as a component of discontinued operations. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.

MANAGEMENTS STRATEGIC PLAN The structure of the utility industry is continually changing, which is driven, in part, by the many different types of government regulation over the industry. Generally, the states in which a utility operates determine the rates that the utility charges its retail customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) establishes the rates that utilities charge for power sold at the 47 wholesale level. The FERC also develops and administers various rules that govern how utilities operate. Utilities also face a wide range of environmental regulations from various government agencies, at both the state and federal level. The mix of state and federal regulations result in numerous rules and regulations, which are not always consistent and are subject to continual change. Clearly, compliance with all of the regulatory requirements increases the complexity and uncertainty of our business. In the last decade or so, the FERC and many states developed rules to encourage competition and deregulation of the utility sector. As a result of these regulatory changes, many utilities have taken steps to prepare for competition and the changing rules. These actions included: completion of mergers and acquisitions to increase economies of scale; efficiency improvements and cost cutting to avoid rate cases and improve competitive position; sales of power plants; use of purchase power contracts to meet growth in electric requirements; and development of nonregulated ventures. On the federal level, the FERC is still very active in promoting wholesale competition. Wholesale operations account for approximately 16 percent of our revenue. FERC has authority to withhold market based rates on wholesale sales in certain areas where a utility is determined to have market power control. However, Xcel Energy believes that it will continue to have the ability to make sales under its market based tariff. As part of its agenda to encourage competition, the FERC has also been very active in promoting regional transmission organizations (RTOs). In the past, each individual utility controlled its transmission lines. Based on certain FERC initiatives, RTOs will control the operations of transmission lines for an entire region to ensure that all parties that want to sell power have access to the lines. We currently participate in the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) and the Southwest Power Pool (SPP). We are supportive of RTO participation, provided that they offer benefits to our customers and we have clear cost recovery mechanisms. In 2005, the MISO will begin its Day 2 operations. This will result in uncertainty, which may have a positive or negative impact on our wholesale margins. However, at the state level, many states have stopped utility restructuring activity due to the failure of the California power markets, the collapse of the independent power producers and other factors. For Xcel Energy, no significant retail regulatory restructuring has occurred or is expected to occur in any of the states in which we have major utility operations. In some parts of Texas, retail customers can choose their energy provider. However, due to legislation that extends through 2007, the panhandle of Texas, where we have utility operations, remains under traditional regulation. We believe that the panhandle will remain under traditional regulation after 2007. Our retail operations represent approximately 82 percent of our revenues. Retail rates are set by state commissions and are intended to provide the utility the opportunity to earn an authorized return on equity. Whether the utility actually earns its authorized return on equity is dependent on many factors including the level of sales growth, changes in a companys cost structure, capital investment, interest rates and other items. Until recently, we have avoided the need to file rate cases by experiencing relatively robust growth in our service territories as well as aggressively managing the costs of our business. Through two mergers, we have realized cost savings and operational efficiencies. These steps have helped us to avoid filing rate cases, but at the same time, we have made significant investments. While we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs, the opportunities are no longer large enough to further delay rate cases. Our regulatory strategy is to ensure that we have the opportunity to earn our authorized return on equity in each state. We are currently not earning our authorized return on equity in the majority of the states where we have our regulated utility operations. As a result, we have or in the near term will begin filing general rate increases in the majority of our jurisdictions as follows. In September 2004, we filed for an approximately $10 million natural gas rate increase in Minnesota. The request assumes an 11.5 percent return on equity. Interim rates, subject to refund, went into effect in December 2004 and we expect a decision this summer. Also in 2004, we filed for a $5 million transmission increase at FERC. 48 In Wisconsin, we are required to file a rate case every other year. Therefore, NSP Wisconsin will file a case during 2005. In Minnesota, we plan to file an electric rate case in the fourth quarter of this year with interim rates, subject to refund, effective in early 2006. We expect a final commission decision in late summer or early fall of 2006. Finally, we intend to file an electric rate case in Colorado in 2006, with rates expected to be in effect during 2007. While recovery of costs cannot be assured, we are optimistic we will receive fair treatment. We believe that we have fair regulation as demonstrated by the successful agreement reached on projects like the metropolitan emissions reduction project (MERP) in Minnesota and the new construction of the Comanche 3 electric generating unit in Colorado. Our ability to maintain a constructive regulatory framework is a critical component of our strategy and ultimate success. Though we remain open to all opportunities to increase shareholder value, our strategy is to invest in our core electric and natural gas businesses to meet the growing energy needs of our customers, while earning a fair return on our investments. We refer to our strategy as Building the Core. We have no plans or interest in deviating from our core business. We see four critical factors to create incremental value for our shareholders and view these factors as building blocks. They are largely independent of each other, but taken together, they have the potential to create significant additional value. The first is service territory growth. With the strength and diversity of our service territory, growth provides a solid foundation year after year. The second driver is incremental investment in our core businesses. Certain incremental investment has already started at a modest level and will grow quickly in the coming years. Key projects include the MERP project and the Comanche 3 coal plant. The third driver is to increase the level of equity that we have invested in our operating companies. Additional equity will increase our financial strength, support a higher credit rating and add to earnings and cash flow. We will work with our regulators to gain support for this initiative. Lastly, we will strive to earn our regulated, authorized returns, which will require filing for rate increases in our largest jurisdictions over the next few years. Execution of our strategy will allow us to meet or exceed our financial objective of delivering an average total return of 7 percent to 9 percent per year. Our total return objective is based on our expectations of long term earnings growth of 2 percent to 4 percent and a dividend yield of approximately 5 percent. We have established a dividend policy that we believe is sustainable and contributes to a competitive total return for our shareholders. Our objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable our board of directors to grant annual dividend increases at a rate consistent with our long term earnings growth rate. As we look to 2005, we are focused on several challenges, in addition to the normal day to day operations of our utility business. We must prepare for operational uncertainty surrounding the implementation of various FERC initiatives, which could impact our short term wholesale margins. We must manage our procurement efforts to attempt to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs, which are passed on to our customers. We must continue to look for creative ways to offset rising healthcare and benefit costs, while we continue our efforts to improve reliability and customer service. While we believe we are well positioned for changing environmental rules and regulations based on the work we have done in the last few years on projects such as MERP, we plan to continue our aggressive efforts to improve our environmental performance. We need to obtain uncontested environmental permits for the new construction of the Comanche 3 coal plant. We expect to complete the sale of Seren. Finally, we will need to seek a Minnesota electric rate increase at the end of 2005. This case will be important as we move into 2006. We believe that we have a solid and straightforward strategy and that, as we execute our plan, it will serve to increase shareholder value. 49 FINANCIAL REVIEW The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. All note references refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Summary of Financial Results The following table summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energys business segments on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Continuing operations consist of the following: regulated utility subsidiaries, operating in the electric and natural gas segments; and several nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company, where corporate financing activity occurs. Discontinued operations consist of the following: Seren, a nonregulated subsidiary, which was classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2004 based on a decision to divest this investment; the regulated natural gas businesses Viking and BMG, which were sold in 2003; the regulated utility business of Cheyenne, which was sold in January 2005; NRG, which emerged from bankruptcy in late 2003, at which time Xcel Energy divested its ownership interest in NRG; and the nonregulated subsidiaries Xcel Energy International and e prime, which were classified as held for sale in late 2003 based on the decision to divest them. Prior year financial statements have been restated to conform to the current year presentation and classification of certain operations as discontinued. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of discontinued operations. Contribution to earnings (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 GAAP income (loss) by segment Regulated electric utility segment income continuing operations $ 466.3 $ 461.3 $ 484.9 Regulated natural gas utility segment income continuing operations 86.1 94.1 88.2 Other utility results (a) 6.0 6.4 20.1 Total utility segment income continuing operations 558.4 561.8 593.2 Other nonregulated results and holding company costs (a) (31.5 ) (36.0 ) (41.8 ) Total income continuing operations 526.9 525.8 551.4 Regulated utility income (loss) discontinued operations (9.0 ) 26.8 13.8 NRG loss discontinued operations (251.4 ) (3,444.1 ) Other nonregulated income (loss) discontinued operations (b) (161.9 ) 321.2 660.9 Total income (loss) discontinued operations (170.9 ) 96.6 (2,769.4 ) Total GAAP income (loss) $ 356.0 $ 622.4 $ (2,218.0 ) 50 Contribution to earnings per share 2004 2003 2002 GAAP earnings per share contribution by segment Regulated electric utility segment continuing operations $ 1.10 $ 1.10 $ 1.26 Regulated natural gas utility segment continuing operations 0.20 0.22 0.23 Other utility results (a) 0.02 0.02 0.05 Total utility segment earnings per share continuing operations 1.32 1.34 1.54 Other nonregulated results and holding company costs (a) (0.05 ) (0.07 ) (0.11 ) Total earnings per share continuing operations 1.27 1.27 1.43 Regulated utility earnings (loss) discontinued operations (0.02 ) 0.06 0.03 NRG loss discontinued operations (0.60 ) (8.95 ) Other nonregulated earnings (loss) discontinued operations (b) (0.38 ) 0.77 1.72 Total earnings (loss) per share discontinued operations (0.40 ) 0.23 (7.20 ) Total GAAP earnings (loss) per share diluted $ 0.87 $ 1.50 $ (5.77 ) (a) Not a reportable segment. Included in All Other segment results in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Includes tax benefit related to NRG. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were flat compared with 2003, the current period results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth, short term wholesale markets and lower depreciation, offset by the negative impact of unfavorable weather, legal settlement costs and the impacts of certain regulatory accruals, compared with the same period in 2003. The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 is largely due to an after tax impairment charge of $143 million related to the planned sale of Seren. The after tax impairment charge was increased in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the impairment estimate recorded in the third quarter of 2004 based on further developed market information, as well as preliminary feedback from prospective buyers. The earnings in 2003 from discontinued operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously estimated tax benefits related to Xcel Energys write off of its investment in NRG. NRG recorded more than $3 billion of asset impairment and other charges in 2002 as it commenced its financial restructuring. Results from discontinued operations are discussed in the Discontinued Operations section later. Common Stock Dilution Dilution, primarily from common stock and convertible securities issued in 2002, reduced the utility segment earnings from continuing operations by 12 cents per share for 2003, compared with average common stock and equivalent levels in 2002. Total earnings from continuing operations were reduced by 11 cents per share for 2003, compared with 2002 share levels. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 423.3 million, 418.9 million and 384.6 million average common shares and equivalents, respectively, were used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Statement of Operations Analysis Continuing Operations The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Electric Utility, Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins Electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states, most fluctuations in energy costs do not materially affect electric utility margin. Xcel Energy has two distinct forms of wholesale marketing activities: short term wholesale and commodity trading. Short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for and energy produced from Xcel Energys generation assets and energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading is not associated with Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. 51 Xcel Energys commodity trading operations are conducted by NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Margins from commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to other operating utilities of Xcel Energy, pursuant to a joint operating agreement (JOA) approved by the FERC. On a consolidated basis, the impact of the JOA is eliminated. Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the impact of regulatory sharing, if applicable. Trading revenues, as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are reported net of trading costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Commodity trading costs include fuel, purchased power, transmission and other related costs. The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short term wholesale and commodity trading activities: (Millions of dollars) Base Electric Utility Short Term Wholesale Commodity Trading Consolidated Totals 2004 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 6,025 $ 220 $ $ 6,245 Fuel and purchased power (2,916 ) (125 ) (3,041 ) Commodity trading revenue 610 610 Commodity trading costs (594 ) (594 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,109 $ 95 $ 16 $ 3,220 Margin as a percentage of revenue 51.6 % 43.2 % 2.6 % 47.0 % 2003 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 5,756 $ 179 $ $ 5,935 Fuel and purchased power (2,588 ) (118 ) (2,706 ) Commodity trading revenue 333 333 Commodity trading costs (316 ) (316 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,168 $ 61 $ 17 $ 3,246 Margin as a percentage of revenue 55.0 % 34.1 % 5.1 % 51.8 % 2002 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 5,218 $ 203 $ $ 5,421 Fuel and purchased power (2,028 ) (170 ) (2,198 ) Commodity trading revenue 1,529 1,529 Commodity trading costs (1,527 ) (1,527 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,190 $ 33 $ 2 $ 3,225 Margin as a percentage of revenue 61.1 % 16.3 % 0.1 % 46.4 % The following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Base Electric Utility Revenue (Millions of dollars) 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ 73 $ 59 Estimated impact of weather (74 ) (29 ) Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 230 434 Air quality improvement recovery (AQIR) (2 ) 36 Firm wholesale 62 30 Capacity sales (2 ) 12 Quality of service obligations (12 ) (11 ) Renewable development fund recovery (5 ) 12 Other (1 ) (5 ) Total base electric utility revenue increase $ 269 $ 538 52 2004 Comparison with 2003 Base electric utility revenues increased due to weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent, higher fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely passed through to customers, and higher revenues from firm wholesale customers. Partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of significantly cooler summer temperatures in 2004 compared with the summer of 2003, as well as estimated customer refunds related to quality of service obligations in Colorado. 2003 Comparison with 2002 Base electric utility revenues increased due to weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.5 percent, higher fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely passed through to customers, and higher capacity sales in Texas. In addition, the AQIR was implemented in Colorado in January 2003 for the recovery of investments and related costs to improve air quality. Partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of warmer temperatures during the summer of 2002 compared with the summer of 2003, as well as 2003 rate reductions related to lower property taxes in Minnesota and estimated customer refunds related to service quality requirements in Colorado. Base Electric Utility Margin (Millions of dollars) 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Estimated impact of weather $ (56 ) $ (23 ) Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 55 48 Purchased capacity costs (12 ) (50 ) Other cost recovery (18 ) (13 ) Quality of service obligations (12 ) (11 ) Renewable development fund recovery (5 ) 12 Capacity sales (2 ) 12 Regulatory accruals and other (9 ) 3 Total base electric utility margin decrease $ (59 ) $ (22 ) 2004 Comparison to 2003 Base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather, higher purchased capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth, higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms, mainly in Wisconsin, and regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in Colorado and fuel reconciliation proceedings in Texas. These decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth. 2003 Comparison to 2002 Base electric utility margin decreased due mainly to higher purchased capacity costs associated with new contracts to support growth, the allowed recovery of fuel and purchased power costs in excess of actual costs in 2002 under the sharing provisions of the incentive cost adjustment mechanism in Colorado, compared with passing through costs with no sharing provisions under the interim adjustment clause in 2003, and the impact of weather. Also decreasing margin were 2003 rate reductions related to lower property taxes in Minnesota and estimated refunds to customers related to service quality requirements in Colorado. The decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth, the implementation of the AQIR and higher capacity sales, as previously discussed. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin 2004 Comparison to 2003 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately $33 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase reflects a number of market factors, including higher market prices, additional resources available for sale and a pre existing contract, which provided approximately $17 million of short term wholesale margins in 2004 and expired in the first quarter of 2004. 2003 Comparison to 2002 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately $43 million in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase reflects more favorable market conditions in the northern regions. Natural Gas Utility Margins The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. 53 (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Natural gas utility revenue $ 1,924 $ 1,685 $ 1,341 Cost of natural gas purchased and transported (1,446 ) (1,191 ) (838 ) Natural gas utility margin $ 478 $ 494 $ 503 The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Natural Gas Revenue (Millions of dollars) 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ (3 ) $ 15 Purchased natural gas adjustment clause recovery 257 346 Rate changes Colorado (15 ) (14 ) Estimated impact of weather (10 ) Transportation and other 10 (3 ) Total natural gas revenue increase $ 239 $ 344 2004 Comparison to 2003 Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs in 2004, which are passed through to customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales declined in 2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage. 2003 Comparison to 2002 Natural gas revenue increased mainly due to higher natural gas costs in 2003, which are passed through to customers. Natural Gas Margin (Millions of dollars) 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ $ 5 Estimated impact of weather on firm sales volume (5 ) (4 ) Rate changes Colorado (15 ) (14 ) Transportation and other 4 4 Total natural gas margin decrease $ (16 ) $ (9 ) 2004 Comparison to 2003 Natural gas margin decreased due to a full year of the base rate decrease, which was effective July 1, 2003, agreed to in the settlement of the PSCo 2002 general rate case and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2004 compared with 2003. The rate case settlement agreement is discussed further under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations. 2003 Comparison to 2002 Natural gas margin decreased due to the rate decrease discussed above and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2003 compared with 2002. The rate case settlement agreement is discussed further under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations. Weather Xcel Energys earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales, but may not reduce expenses, which affects overall results. The impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of gas or electricity the average customer historically has used per degree of temperature. The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from historical averages: weather in 2004 decreased earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share; weather in 2003 had minimal impact on earnings per share; and weather in 2002 increased earnings by an estimated 6 cents per share. 54 Nonregulated Operating Margins The following table details the changes in nonregulated revenue and margin included in continuing operations: (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Nonregulated and other revenue $ 161 $ 222 $ 211 Nonregulated cost of goods sold (83 ) (143 ) (110 ) Nonregulated margin $ 78 $ 79 $ 101 2004 Comparison to 2003 Nonregulated revenue decreased in 2004, due primarily to the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned. 2003 Comparison to 2002 Nonregulated revenue increased in 2003, due mainly to increased revenues at Utility Engineering. Nonregulated margin decreased in 2003, due to higher cost of goods sold at a subsidiary of Utility Engineering. Non Fuel Operating Expense and Other Items Other Utility Operating and Maintenance Expense Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2004 increased by approximately $22 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with 2003. Of the increase, $12 million of increased costs are offset by increased revenue, including those incurred to assist with the storm damage repair in Florida. The remaining increase of $10 million is primarily due to lower pension credits and higher employee benefit costs of $31 million, higher electric service reliability costs of $9 million, higher information technology costs of $8 million, higher legal settlement costs of $7 million, higher plant related costs of $4 million, higher costs related to a customer billing system conversion of $4 million and $4 million of increased costs primarily related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The higher costs were partially offset by lower compensation costs of $43 million, lower costs associated with inventory adjustments of $14 million and lower private fuel storage costs of $6 million. Other operating and maintenance expenses increased $90 million, or 6.0 percent, in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is due primarily to higher employee related costs, including higher performance based compensation of $36 million, restricted stock unit grants of $29 million, lower pension credits of $19 million and higher medical and health care costs of $9 million. In 2002, there were no restricted stock unit grants and only a partial award of performance base compensation. In addition, other utility operating and maintenance expense for 2003 reflects inventory write downs of $8 million, higher uncollectible accounts receivable of $3 million, higher reliability expenses of $6 million and a software project write off of $2 million. The increase was partially offset by lower information technology costs resulting from centralization. Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance Expense Other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased $14 million, or 19.6 percent, in 2004 compared with 2003. This decrease resulted from the dissolution of Planergy and the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned after the divestiture of NRG. See additional discussion of the total results for each nonregulated subsidiary later. Other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased $21 million, or 23.2 percent, in 2003 compared with 2002. The 2002 expenses included employee severance costs at the holding company. These expenses are included in the results for each nonregulated subsidiary, as discussed later. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for 2004 decreased by approximately $21 million, or 2.8 percent, compared with 2003, and $18 million, or 2.4 percent, in 2003 compared with 2002. The fluctuations are largely due to several regulatory decisions in 2003. In 2004, as a result of a Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) order, NSP Minnesota modified its decommissioning expense recognition, which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by approximately $18 million compared with 2003. In addition, effective July 1, 2003, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility plant at PSCo as a part of the general Colorado rate case, reducing annual depreciation expense by $20 million. PSCo experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in 2004, resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $10 million for 2004 compared with 2003. 55 During 2003, the Minnesota Legislature authorized additional spent nuclear fuel storage at the Prairie Island nuclear plant. In December 2003, the MPUC extended the authorized depreciable lives of the two generating units at the Prairie Island nuclear plant, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2003, reducing depreciation by $22 million. Special Charges Special charges in 2004 were $17.6 million relating to the settlement of shareholder litigation. Special charges reported in 2003 relate to the TRANSLink Transmission Co., LLC (TRANSLink) project and NRG restructuring costs. Special charges for 2002 include NRG restructuring costs, as discussed later, but are largely related to regulated utility costs. Regulated utility earnings from continuing operations were reduced by approximately 2 cents per share in 2002 due to a $5 million regulatory recovery adjustment for SPS and $9 million in employee separation costs associated with a restaffing initiative for utility and service company operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these items. Interest and Other Income, Net of Nonoperating Expenses Interest and other income, net of nonoperating expenses increased $5 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior period Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of $10.5 million. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of a Utility Engineering gain on the sale of water rights in 2003, net of write offs of certain intangible assets. Interest and other income, net of nonoperating expenses decreased $27 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Interest income decreased $13 million primarily due to interest received on tax refunds in 2002. Other income decreased $10 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of contracts at Planergy in 2002. Interest and Financing Costs Interest charges and financing costs decreased approximately $16 million, or 3.6 percent, for 2004, compared with 2003. The decrease for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during 2003 and lower credit line fees, partially offset by interest expense related to prior period IRS audits. Interest and financing costs increased approximately $30 million, or 7.1 percent, for 2003 compared with 2002. This increase was due to the full year impact of the issuance of long term debt in the latter part of 2002 intended to reduce dependence on short term debt. In addition, during 2002, Xcel Energy incurred approximately $15 million to redeem temporary holding company debt. During 2003, Xcel Energy issued approximately $1.7 billion of long term debt to refinance higher coupon debt. During 2002, certain long term debt was refinanced at higher interest rates. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate was 23.2 percent for the year 2004, compared with 24.6 percent for the same period in 2003. Significant tax benefits were recorded during the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003 due to the resolution of tax audit issues, largely related to prior periods. Significant income tax audit activity occurring in 2003 continued in 2004. With the exception of the corporate owned life insurance (COLI) loan interest deductibility, as discussed in Note 16, during 2004, Xcel Energy concluded IRS income tax audit and appeal activities spanning several examination cycles dating back to 1993. In addition, the IRS nearly completed the examination cycle ended 2001 and began its review of Xcel Energys 2002 and 2003 tax years. In 2004, income tax benefits of $39.3 million were recorded, including $28.9 million related to the successful resolution of various IRS audit issues and other adjustments to current and deferred taxes related to prior years, $7.7 million for the 2003 return to actual true up and $2.7 million from revisions to benefits related to asset and foreign power sales. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate for 2004 would have been 28.9 percent. In 2003, income tax benefits of $36 million were recorded to reflect the resolution of tax audit issues related to prior years. The tax issues resolved during 2003 included the tax deductibility of certain merger costs associated with the mergers to form Xcel Energy and New Century Energies, Inc. (NCE) and the deductibility, for state purposes, of certain tax benefit transfer lease benefits. Excluding these tax benefits, the effective rate for 2003 would have been 29.7 percent. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Other Nonregulated Subsidiaries and Holding Company Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses and holding company results: (Millions of dollars) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings 2004 2003 2002 Eloigne Company $ 8.5 $ 7.7 $ 8.0 Planergy (1.3 ) (7.7 ) (1.7 ) Financing costs holding company (44.7 ) (44.1 ) (47.3 ) Special charges holding company (10.3 ) (11.2 ) (2.9 ) Other nonregulated and holding company results 16.3 19.3 2.1 Total nonregulated/holding company loss continuing operations $ (31.5 ) $ (36.0 ) $ (41.8 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings per share 2004 2003 2002 Eloigne Company $ 0.02 $ 0.02 $ 0.02 Planergy (0.02 ) Financing costs and preferred dividends holding company (0.08 ) (0.09 ) (0.13 ) Special charges holding company (0.03 ) (0.03 ) (0.01 ) Other nonregulated and holding company results 0.04 0.05 0.01 Total nonregulated/holding company loss per share continuing operations $ (0.05 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.11 ) Eloigne Company Eloigne invests in affordable housing that qualifies for federal and state tax credits. Eloignes earnings contribution is expected to decline slightly each year as tax credits on mature affordable housing projects begin to decline. Planergy Planergy provided energy management services. Planergys losses were lower in 2004 due to the dissolution of its business. Its losses were lower in 2002 largely due to pretax gains of approximately $8 million from the sale of a portfolio of energy management contracts, which reduced losses by approximately 2 cents per share. Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends Nonregulated results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. In November 2002, the Xcel Energy holding company issued temporary financing, which included detachable options for the purchase of Xcel Energy notes, which were convertible to Xcel Energy common stock. This temporary financing was replaced with long term holding company financing in late November 2002. Costs incurred to redeem the temporary financing included a redemption premium of $7.4 million, $5.2 million of debt discount associated with the detachable option, and other issuance costs, which increased financing costs and reduced 2002 earnings by 2 cents per share. The earnings per share impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2004 and 2003 included above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the dilutive securities, if converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately $15 million, or 4 cents per share, in 2004, and $11 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2003. Holding Company Special Charges During 2004, special charges at the holding company consisted of an accrual of $17.6 million for a settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these special charges. During 2002, NRG experienced credit rating downgrades, defaults under certain credit agreements, increased collateral requirements and reduced liquidity. These events ultimately led to the restructuring of NRG in late 2002 and its bankruptcy filing in May 2003. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain costs related to NRGs restructuring were incurred at the holding company level and included in continuing operations and reported as Special Charges. Approximately $12 million of these costs were incurred 57 in 2003 and $5 million were incurred in 2002, which reduced after tax earnings by approximately 2 cents per share and 1 cent per share, respectively. Costs in 2003 included approximately $32 million of financial advisor fees, legal costs and consulting costs related to the NRG bankruptcy transaction. These charges were partially offset by a $20 million pension curtailment gain related to the termination of NRG employees from Xcel Energys pension plan. In 2003, Xcel Energy also recorded a $7 million charge in connection with the suspension of the formation of the independent transmission company TRANSLink. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these special charges. Other Nonregulated In 2003, Utility Engineering sold water rights, resulting in a pretax gain (reported as nonoperating income) of $15 million. The gain increased after tax income by approximately 2 cents per share. Statement of Operations Analysis Discontinued Operations A summary of the various components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended Dec. 31: Income (loss) in millions 2004 2003 2002 Viking Gas Transmission Co. $ 1.3 $ 21.9 $ 9.4 Black Mountain Gas 2.4 1.0 Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co.

After tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents per share, were recorded for the natural gas utility segment, primarily related to the sale of Viking. Viking had minimal income in 2003, as it was sold in January of that year. Income from Viking was higher in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily due to increased revenues. During January 2004, Xcel Energy reached an agreement to sell its regulated electric and natural gas subsidiary Cheyenne. As a result of this agreement, Xcel Energy is reporting Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The 58 sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued at Dec. 31, 2004. NRG Results Discontinued Operations Due to NRGs emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel Energys corresponding divestiture of its ownership interest in NRG, Xcel Energys share of NRG results for current and prior periods is now shown as a component of discontinued operations. 2004 NRG Results Compared with 2003 As a result of NRGs emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003, Xcel Energy did not retain an ownership interest in NRG after that date. Therefore, Xcel Energy financial statements do not contain any results of NRG operations in 2004. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the following discussion for further information. 2003 NRG Results Compared with 2002 As a result of NRGs bankruptcy filing in May 2003, Xcel Energy ceased the consolidation of NRG and began accounting for its investment in NRG using the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. After changing to the equity method, Xcel Energy was limited in the amount of NRGs losses subsequent to the bankruptcy date that it was required to record. In accordance with these limitations under the equity method, Xcel Energy stopped recognizing equity in the losses of NRG subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2003. These limitations provided for loss recognition by Xcel Energy until its investment in NRG was written off to zero, with further loss recognition to continue if its financial commitments to NRG existed beyond amounts already invested. Xcel Energy initially recorded more losses than the limitations allow as of June 30, 2003, but upon Xcel Energys divestiture of its interest in NRG, the NRG losses recorded in excess of Xcel Energys investment in and financial commitment to NRG were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2003. This resulted in a noncash gain of $111 million, or 26 cents per share, for the quarter and an adjustment of the total NRG losses recorded for the year 2003 to $251 million, or 60 cents per share. NRGs results included in Xcel Energys earnings for 2003 were as follows: (Millions of dollars) Six months ended June 30, 2003 Total NRG loss $ (621 ) Losses not recorded by Xcel Energy under the equity method* 370 Equity in losses of NRG included in Xcel Energy results for 2003 $ (251 ) * These represent NRG losses incurred in the first and second quarters of 2003 that were in excess of the amounts recordable by Xcel Energy under the equity method of accounting limitations discussed previously. Following its credit downgrade in July 2002, NRG experienced credit and liquidity constraints and commenced a financial and business restructuring, including a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection. This restructuring created significant incremental costs and resulted in numerous asset impairments as the strategic and economic value of assets under development and in operation changed. NRGs asset impairments and related charges in 2003 were approximately $540 million related to its NEO landfill gas projects and equity investments, planned disposals of domestic and international projects, and regulatory developments and changing circumstances that adversely affected NRGs ability to recover the carrying value of certain investments. As of the bankruptcy filing date (May 14, 2003), Xcel Energy had recognized $263 million of NRGs impairments and related charges as these charges were recorded by NRG prior to May 14, 2003. Consequently, Xcel Energy recorded its equity in NRG results in excess of its financial commitment to NRG under the settlement agreement reached in March 2003 among Xcel Energy, NRG and NRGs creditors. These excess losses were reversed upon NRGs emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003, as discussed previously. In 2003, NRGs operating results (excluding the unusual items discussed above) were affected by higher market prices due to higher natural gas prices and an increase in capacity revenues due to additional projects becoming operational in the later part of 2002. In addition, the sale of an NRG investment in 2002 resulted in a favorable impact in 2003 as the investment generated substantial equity losses in the prior years. The increase was offset by losses incurred on contracts in Connecticut due to increased market prices, increased operating expenses, contract terminations and liquidated damages triggered by NRGs financial condition and additional restructuring charges. 59 During 2002, the tax filing status of NRG for 2002 and future years changed from being included as part of Xcel Energys consolidated federal income tax group to filing on a stand alone basis. Other Nonregulated Results Discontinued Operations On Sept. 27, 2004, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to pursue the sale of Seren, a wholly owned broadband communications services subsidiary. Seren delivers cable television, high speed Internet and telephone service over an advanced network to approximately 45,000 customers in St. Cloud, Minn., and Concord and Walnut Creek, Calif. As a result of the decision, Seren is accounted for as discontinued operations. The sale of such investment is expected to be completed by mid 2005. During 2003, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and Xcel Energy International. e prime ceased conducting business in 2004. Also during 2004, Xcel Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International. 2004 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2003 Results of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International. The sales were completed in three transactions with a total sales price of approximately $31 million, including certain adjustments that reached finalization in the fourth quarter of 2004. Approximately $15 million was placed in escrow, which is expected to remain in place until at least the end of the first quarter of 2005, to support customary indemnity obligations under the sales agreement. In addition to the sales price, Xcel Energy also received approximately $21 million at the closing of one transaction as redemption of its capital investment. The sales resulted in a gain of approximately $8 million, including the realization of approximately $7 million of income tax benefits realizable upon sale of the Xcel Energy International assets. In addition, 2004 results from discontinued operations include the impact of an after tax impairment charge for Seren, including disposition costs, of $143 million, or 34 cents per share. The impairment charge was recorded based on operating results, market conditions and preliminary feedback from prospective buyers. 2003 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2002 Results of discontinued nonregulated operations, other than NRG, include an after tax loss of $59 million, or 14 cents per share, for the disposal of Xcel Energy Internationals assets, based on the estimated fair value of such assets. These losses from discontinued nonregulated operations also include a charge of $16 million for costs of settling a Commodity Futures Trading Commission trading investigation of e prime. Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits related to the divestiture of NRG. These tax benefits, since related to Xcel Energys investment in discontinued NRG operations, also are reported as discontinued operations. During 2002, Xcel Energy recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of $706 million. Based on the results of a 2003 preliminary tax basis study of NRG, Xcel Energy recorded $404 million of additional tax benefits in 2003. In 2004, the NRG basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $16 million. Based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years. Xcel Energy used $405 million and $116 million of these tax benefits in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and expects to use $145 million in 2005. The remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years. Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect our ability to recover our costs from customers. In addition, Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses have had an adverse impact on Xcel Energys earnings in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: 60 General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. The United States economy continues to show evidence of recovery as measured by growth in the gross domestic product. However, certain operating costs, such as those for insurance and security, have increased during the past three years due to economic uncertainty, terrorist activity and war or the threat of war. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a slowdown in future economic growth. Sales Growth In addition to the impact of weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energys regulated utility businesses can vary with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and other factors. Weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was estimated to be 1.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003, and 1.5 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was estimated to be approximately (1.9) percent in 2004 compared with 2003 and 1.6 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Projections indicate that weather normalized sales growth in 2005 compared with 2004 will be approximately 2.2 percent for retail electric utility customers and 1.1 percent for firm gas utility customers. Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements. Pension costs have been increasing in recent years, and are expected to increase further over the next several years, due to lower than expected investment returns experienced in prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit obligations. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 9.25 percent in 2003 and 9.0 percent in 2004, investment returns in 2001 and 2002 were below the assumed level of 9.5 percent and discount rates have declined from the 7.25 percent to 8 percent levels used in 1999 through 2002 cost determinations to 6.25 percent used in 2004. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and, in 2005, expects to change the investment return assumption to 8.75 percent and the discount rate assumption to 6.0 percent. The investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on smoothed or market related asset levels and actual returns earned is deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period. This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year, moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the costdetermination process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period. Based on the use of average market related asset values, and considering the expected recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, achieving the assumed rate of asset return of 8.75 percent in each future year and holding other assumptions constant, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will increase from a credit, or negative expense, of $27 million in 2004 to an expense of $8 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2006. Pension costs are currently a credit due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding the other pension cost components, such as benefits earned for current service and interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted obligations. Xcel Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates quoted by an established credit rating agency, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), and has consistently benchmarked the interest rate used to derive the discount rate to the movements in the long term corporate bond indices for bonds rated Aaa through Baa by Moodys, which have a period to maturity comparable to our projected benefit obligations. At Dec. 31, 2003, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.61 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.63 percent. The corresponding pension discount rate was 6.25 percent. At Dec. 31, 2004, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate had declined 51 basis points to 6.10 percent, and the Aaa index rate had declined 20 basis points to 5.43 percent. Accordingly, the discount rate as of Dec. 31, 2004, was lowered 25 basis points to 6.00 percent. This rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2005 pension cost determinations. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a 1 percent change would result in the following impacts on the estimated pension costs recognized by Xcel Energy for financial reporting purposes: 61 a 100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75 percent, would decrease 2005 pension costs by $17.9 million; a 100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75 percent, would increase 2005 pension costs by $17.9 million; a 100 basis point higher discount rate, 7.0 percent, would decrease 2005 pension costs by $8.3 million; and a 100 basis point lower discount rate, 5.0 percent, would increase 2005 pension costs by $6.2 million. Alternative Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding assumptions would also change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans. Cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions, actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension related regulations. These regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for Xcel Energys pension plans, and do not require funding in 2005. Assuming that future asset return levels equal the actuarial assumption of 8.75 percent for the years 2005 and 2006, Xcel Energy projects, under current funding regulations, that no cash funding would be required for 2005 and cash funding of $9 million would be required for 2006. Actual performance can affect these funding requirements significantly. Current funding regulations are under legislative review in 2005 and, if not retained in their current form, could change these funding requirements materially. Regulation Xcel Energy, its utility subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC under the PUHCA with respect to issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties and intra system sales of certain non power goods and services. In addition, the PUHCA generally limits the ability of registered holding companies to acquire additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company. See further discussion of financing restrictions under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries also are regulated by the FERC and state regulatory commissions. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive rate changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investment, sales growth, conservation and demand side management efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. The most recently authorized electric utility returns are 11.47 percent for NSP Minnesota, 11.9 percent for NSP Wisconsin, 10.75 percent for PSCo and 11.5 percent for SPS. Most of the retail rates for Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries provide for periodic adjustments to billings and revenues to allow for recovery of changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation, purchased energy, purchased natural gas for resale and, in Minnesota and Colorado, conservation, energy management program costs and certain other costs. In Colorado, certain purchased electric capacity costs are recovered through a rate adjustment mechanism. In Minnesota, generally changes in purchased electric capacity costs are not recovered through these rate adjustment mechanisms. For Wisconsin electric operations, where automatic cost of energy adjustment clauses are not allowed, the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost of energy adjustment clause. In Colorado, PSCo had an interim adjustment clause that allowed for recovery of all prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in 2003. In 2004, PSCo generally recovered all prudently incurred electric fuel and purchased energy costs through an electric commodity adjustment clause. Additionally, this fuel mechanism also has in place a sharing among customers and shareholders of certain fuel and energy costs, with an $11.25 million maximum on any cost sharing over or under an allowed electric commodity adjustment formula rate, and a sharing among shareholders and customers of certain gains and losses on trading margins. In 2004, PSCo estimated that energy costs incurred were lower than the commodity adjustment formula rate and accrued an incentive of $11.25 million at Dec. 31, 2004. Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy distribution system. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, in 2002 and 2003 approval was obtained from Colorado and Minnesota regulators to recover, through a rate surcharge, certain costs to upgrade plants and lower emissions in the Denver and Minneapolis St. Paul 62 metropolitan areas. These rate recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. Regulated public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods and to record as regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. In contrast, nonregulated enterprises would expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period. If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energys results of operations in the period the write off is recorded. At Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $851 million and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.6 billion that would be recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities, restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing. See Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals. Tax Matters Interest Expense Deductibility PSCos wholly owned subsidiary, PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), owns and manages permanent life insurance policies, known as COLI policies, on some of PSCos employees. At various times, borrowings have been made against the cash values of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through 1999. Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31, 2004, would reduce earnings by an estimated $311 million. In 2004, Xcel Energy received formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated interest) are also included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2004, is approximately $368 million. Xcel Energy estimates its annual earnings for 2005 would be reduced by $40 million, after tax, which represents 9 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no longer available. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions In late July 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition of tax benefits, which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits, which have some degree of uncertainty. The FASB has not issued any proposed guidance, but an exposure draft may be released in the first quarter of 2005. Xcel Energy is unable to determine the impact or timing of any potential accounting changes required by the FASB, but such changes could have a material financial impact. Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes were approximately: $133 million in 2004; $133 million in 2003; and $138 million in 2002. Xcel Energy expects to expense an average of approximately $154 million per year from 2005 through 2009 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain. 63 Capital expenditures on environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $20.9 million in 2004; $58.5 million in 2003; and $107.8 million in 2002. The regulated utilities expect to incur approximately $221 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in 2005 and approximately $980 million of related expenditures during the period from 2006 through 2009. Approximately $171 million and $787 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of NSP Minnesotas generating plants located in the Minneapolis St. Paul metropolitan area pursuant to the metropolitan emissions reduction project, which are recoverable from customers through cost recovery mechanisms. See Notes 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. Impact of Nonregulated Investments In the past, Xcel Energys investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its results. Xcel Energy does not expect to make any material investments in nonregulated projects. Xcel Energys remaining nonregulated businesses may carry a higher level of risk than its traditional utility businesses. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors. 64 Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application See Additional Discussion At Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery External regulatory decisions, requirements and regulatory environment Managements Discussion and Analysis: Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Anticipated future regulatory Regulation decisions and their impact Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Impact of deregulation and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Notes 1, 16 and 18 Nuclear Plant Costs of future decommissioning Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Decommissioning and Cost Recovery Availability of facilities for waste disposal Notes 1, 16 and 17 Approved methods for waste disposal Useful lives of nuclear power plants Future recovery of plant investment and decommissioning costs Income Tax Accruals Application of tax statutes and Managements Discussion and Analysis: regulations to transactions Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Anticipated future decisions of tax Operations authorities Tax Matters Ability of tax authority Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements decisions/positions to withstand Notes 1, 10 and 16 legal challenges and appeals Ability to realize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods or carry overs to future periods Benefit Plan Accounting Future rate of return on pension and Managements Discussion and Analysis: other plan assets, including impacts of any changes to investment Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations portfolio composition Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Discount rates used in valuing Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements benefit obligation Notes 1 and 12 Actuarial period selected to recognize deferred investment gains and losses Asset Valuation Regional economic conditions Managements Discussion and Analysis: affecting asset operation, market Results of Operations prices and related cash flows Statement of Operations Analysis Regulatory and political Discontinued Operations environments and requirements Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Levels of future market penetration Operations and customer growth Impact of Nonregulated Investments Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3 65 Xcel Energy continually makes informed judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. For example: Probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from regulators. The ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their useful operating lives, or such other period designated by our regulators, is assumed. Probable outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities, including appeals and litigation where necessary, are assessed. Projections are made regarding earnings on pension investments, and the salary increases provided to employees over their periods of service. Future cash inflows of operations are projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future cash outflows, including the impacts of product price changes and market penetration to customer groups. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impacts of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2004. Recently Implemented Accounting Changes For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pending Accounting Changes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 123R related to equity based compensation. This statement replaces the original SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under SFAS No. 123R, companies are no longer allowed to account for their share based payment awards using the intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements, which did not require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or greater than fair market value exercise price. Instead, equity based compensation arrangements will be measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value using an option pricing model (such as Black Scholes or Binomial) that considers at least six factors identified in SFAS No. 123R. An expense related to the difference between the grant date fair value and the purchase price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options. Under previous guidance, companies were allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually occurred. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures will differ from previous estimates. Revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision occurs. Previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met. However, under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the companys failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed. Any accruals made for Xcel Energys restricted stock unit plan could not be reversed if the target was not met. Implementation of SFAS No. 123R is required for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Xcel Energy is required to adopt the provisions in the third quarter of 2005. Implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income or earnings per share. DERIVATIVES, RISK MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail below. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their generation and retail distribution operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric power, natural gas, coal and fuel oil. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists. 66 Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energys subsidiaries conduct various commodity marketing activities, including the purchase and sale of capacity, energy and energy related instruments. These marketing activities are primarily focused on specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and are generally less than one year in length. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct the marketing activities within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the companys risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy. Certain contracts within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, while others are subject to the fair value requirements of this pronouncement. The fair value of the commodity trading contracts for continuing operations as of Dec. 31, 2004, was as follows: (Millions of dollars) Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Jan. 1, 2004 $ 4.2 Contracts realized or settled during the year (21.6 ) Fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year 17.4 Fair value of contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004 $ As of Dec. 31, 2004, the sources of fair value of the commodity trading and hedging net assets were as follows: Commodity Trading Contracts Futures/Forwards (Thousands of dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value NSP Minnesota 1 $ 51 $ $ $ $ 51 2 874 874 PSCo 1 (922 ) (922 ) 2 (134 ) (134 ) Total futures/forwards fair value $ (131 ) $ $ $ $ (131 ) Options (Thousands of dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value PSCo 2 139 139 Total options fair value $ 139 $ $ $ $ 139 67 Hedge Contracts Futures/Forwards (Thousands of dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value PSCo 2 $ 1,047 $ $ $ $ 1,047 Total futures/forwards fair value $ 1,047 $ $ $ $ 1,047 Options (Thousands of dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value NSP Minnesota 2 $ (7,153 ) $ $ $ $ (7,153 ) NSP Wisconsin 2 (1,060 ) (1,060 ) PSCo 2 (18,453 ) 1,028 (17,425 ) Total options fair value $ (26,666 ) $ 1,028 $ $ $ (25,638 ) 1 Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. 2 Prices based on models and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model. Normal purchases and sales transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133, as amended, have been excluded. At Dec. 31, 2004, a 10 percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for trading contracts would impact pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $(0.1) million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would impact pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million. Hedge contracts are accounted for as a component of Other Comprehensive Income and would not directly impact earnings. Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as Value at Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR model employs a 95 percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas. Previously, Xcel Energy calculated VaR using a holding period of five days for electricity and two days for natural gas. However, the methodology was changed to ensure consistency in risk measurement across both commodities. Xcel Energys revised holding periods remain consistent with current industry practice. VaR using the current methodology for 2004 and previous methodology for 2003 are as follows: As of Dec. 31, 2004, the calculated VaRs using the current methodology were: Current Methodology Year ended During 2004 (Millions of dollars) Dec. 31, 2004 Average High Low Commodity trading (a) $ 0.29 $ 0.97 $ 2.09 $ 0.27 (a) Comprises transactions for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. 68 As of Dec. 31, 2003, the calculated VaRs using the previous methodology were: Previous Methodology Year ended During 2003 (Millions of dollars) Dec. 31, 2003 Average High Low Electric commodity trading (a) $ 0.92 $ 0.70 $ 1.51 $ 0.29 Natural gas commodity trading (b) $ $ 0.06 $ 0.89 $ Natural gas retail marketing (b) $ 0.08 $ 0.32 $ 1.00 $ 0.02 Other $ $ 0.02 $ 0.15 $ (a) Comprises transactions for both NSP Minnesota and PSCo. (b) Conducted by e prime, which is a discontinued operation. Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. Xcel Energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. Reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from Other Comprehensive Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt instrument and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair values of related hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. To test the effectiveness of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis, if required. The assessment is done periodically to ensure the swaps continue to be effective. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty valuations, internal valuations and broker quotes. There have been no material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate swaps during the periods presented. At Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $6.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to fund certain costs of nuclear decommissioning, which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. As of Dec. 31, 2004 and 2003, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities. Per NRC mandates, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices, or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk In addition to the risks discussed previously, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. At Dec. 31, 2004, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of $23.4 million, while a decrease of 10 percent would have resulted in a decrease of $14.4 million. 69 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Due to the discontinuance of NRG and Xcel Energy Internationals operations in 2003, as discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Xcel Energy no longer has material foreign currency exchange risk. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities Continuing operations $ 1,126 $ 1,107 $ 1,282 Discontinued operations (309 ) 271 433 Total $ 817 $ 1,378 $ 1,715 Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations increased $19 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due to the timing of payments made for trade payables partially offset by increased inventory costs related to higher natural gas costs, which will be collected from customers in future periods. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased $580 million during 2004 compared with 2003. During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by tax benefits received. Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations decreased during 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to decreases in recovery of deferred fuel costs. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased during 2003 compared with 2002 due to the de consolidation of NRG for 2003 reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year. The decrease was partially offset by tax benefits received in connection with the divestiture of NRG in 2003. (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities Continuing operations $ (1,272 ) $ (1,036 ) $ (990 ) Discontinued operations 37 110 (1,721 ) Total $ (1,235 ) $ (926 ) $ (2,711 ) Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $236 million during 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations decreased $73 million during 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Viking in 2003. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was approximately the same during 2003 compared with 2002 due to comparable utility construction expenditures. Cash flows for investing activities related to discontinued operations increased during 2003 compared with 2002 due to the de consolidation of NRG for 2003 reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year. NRG had significant construction expenditures during 2002 prior to its financial difficulties. (Millions of dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Continuing operations $ (111 ) $ (363 ) $ 115 Discontinued operations (4 ) 1,465 Total $ (111 ) $ (367 ) $ 1,580 Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased $252 million during 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased short term borrowings partially offset by a common stock repurchase. Cash flows for financing activities related to continuing operations decreased during 2003 compared with 2002 due to refinancing activities in 2003 to better align Xcel Energys capital structure and manage the cost of capital given the improving credit quality of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries. During 2003, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries extinguished $1.3 billion of long term debt and issued 70 approximately $1.7 billion of long term debt, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Capitalization. Cash flows for financing activities related to discontinued operations decreased during 2003 compared with 2002 due to the de consolidation of NRG for 2003 reporting and the exclusion of any of its cash flows in that year. NRG obtained financing in 2002 for its construction expenditures prior to experiencing its financial difficulties. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources. Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures, Nonregulated Investments and Long Term Debt Obligations The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are shown in the table below. (Millions of dollars) 2005 2006 2007 Electric utility $ 1,039 $ 1,293 $ 1,283 Natural gas utility 114 107 120 Common utility 87 96 94 Total utility 1,240 1,496 1,497 Other nonregulated 1 4 8 Total capital expenditures 1,241 1,500 1,505 Debt maturities 224 839 341 Total capital requirements $ 1,465 $ 2,339 $ 1,846 The capital expenditure forecast includes the 750 megawatt Comanche 3 coal fired plant in Colorado and the MERP project, which will reduce the emissions of three NSP Minnesotas generating plants. The MERP project is expected to cost approximately $1 billion, with major construction starting in 2005 and finishing in 2009. Xcel Energy expects to recover the costs of the emission reduction project through customer rate increases beginning in 2006. Comanche 3 is expected to cost approximately $1.35 billion, with major construction starting in 2006 and finishing in 2010. The Colorado commission has approved sharing one third ownership of this plant with other parties. Consequently, Xcel Energys capital expenditure forecast includes $1 billion, approximately two thirds of the total cost. Xcel Energy is evaluating a potential investment in a wind generation project of approximately $165 million, currently not included in the capital expenditure forecast. A decision to move forward with this type of investment will be dependent on the extension of federal tax credits related to wind generation, favorable regulatory recovery and other business considerations. The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energys long term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energys ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future requirements to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements. For more information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2004. See additional discussion in the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Notes 5, 6, 15 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Less than 1 Payments due by period After (Thousands of dollars) Total year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years 5 years Long term debt, principal and interest payments $ 10,369,734 $ 631,129 $ 1,904,191 $ 1,849,040 $ 5,985,374 Capital lease obligations 105,356 6,672 12,734 12,123 73,827 Operating leases (a) 358,695 55,103 117,678 114,237 71,677 Unconditional purchase obligations (b) 11,608,993 2,282,749 2,564,718 1,936,891 4,824,635 Other long term obligations 147,237 40,419 41,669 33,240 31,909 Payments to vendors in process 106,144 106,144 Short term debt 312,300 312,300 Total contractual cash obligations (c) $ 23,008,459 $ 3,434,516 $ 4,640,990 $ 3,945,531 $ 10,987,422 71 (a) Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2004, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $130.5 million. (b) Obligations to purchase fuel for electric generating plants, and electricity and natural gas for resale. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted based on indexes. However, the effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (c) Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately $500 million of goods and services through the year 2020, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures. Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent upon the statutory limitations discussed below, as well as Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energys objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable the board of directors to grant annual dividend increases at a rate consistent with our long term earnings growth rate. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: projected cash generation from utility operations; projected capital investment in the utility businesses; reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. Under PUHCA, unless there is an order from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary may only declare and pay dividends out of retained earnings. Xcel Energy had $397 million of retained earnings at Dec. 31, 2004, and expects to declare dividends as scheduled. The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from the utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent. All utility subsidiaries are required under PUHCA to pay dividends only from retained earnings, and some must comply with covenant restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios. The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energys capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, i.e., not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energys capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2004, was 80 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energys ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock. Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Registered holding companies and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries, are limited under PUHCA in their ability to issue securities. Such registered holding companies and their subsidiaries may not issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the SEC. Because Xcel Energy does not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules, it has received financing authority from the SEC under PUHCA for various financing arrangements. Xcel Energys current financing authority permits it, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to issue through June 30, 2005, up to $2.5 billion of common stock 72 and long term debt and $1.5 billion of short term debt at the holding company level. Xcel Energy has issued $2.2 billion of long term debt and common stock, including the $600 million credit facility that closed in November 2004 that replaced the previous $400 million facility. On Dec. 17, 2004, Xcel Energy filed an application with the SEC requesting additional financing authorization beyond June 30, 2005. If approved, the new financing authority would extend through June 30, 2008. The new application requests the authority for Xcel Energy to issue up to $1.8 billion of new long term debt, common equity and equity linked securities and $1.0 billion of short term debt securities during the new authorization period, provided that the aggregate amount of long term debt, common equity, equity linked and short term debt securities issued during the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0 billion. Xcel Energy expects the SEC to issue an order prior to the expiration of the existing authorization. Xcel Energys ability to issue securities under the financing authority is subject to a number of conditions. One of the conditions of the financing authority is that Xcel Energys consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at least 30 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2004, the common equity ratio was approximately 42 percent. Additional conditions require that a security to be issued that is rated, be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. Finally, all outstanding securities that are rated must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. On Feb. 17, 2005, Xcel Energys senior unsecured debt was considered investment grade by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (Standard & Poors) and Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys). Short Term Funding Sources Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures. Another significant short term funding need is the dividend payment. As of Feb. 17, 2005, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: Company Facility Drawn* Available Cash Liquidity Maturity (Millions of dollars) NSP Minnesota $ 300 $ 84 $ 216 $ $ 216 May 2005** NSP Wisconsin PSCo 350 151 199 29 228 May 2005** SPS 125 68 57 57 May 2005** Xcel Energy holding company 600 160 440 2 442 November 2009 Total $ 1,375 $ 463 $ 912 $ 31 $ 943 * Includes short term borrowings and letters of credit ** The credit facilities of NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS are expected to be renewed as five year revolving credit facilities through a pro rata syndication prior to May 2005. Operating cash flow as a source of short term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather; regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental regulation compliance and industry deregulation; changes in the trends for energy prices; and supply and operational uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations Analysis. Short term borrowing as a source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energys short term borrowing arrangements, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moodys and Standard & Poors. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating company. As of Feb. 17, 2005, the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies: 73 Company Credit Type Moodys Standard & Poors Xcel Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB Xcel Energy Commercial Paper NP A2 NSP Minnesota Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB NSP Minnesota Senior Secured Debt A2 A NSP Minnesota Commercial Paper P2 A2 NSP Wisconsin Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB NSP Wisconsin Senior Secured Debt A2 A PSCo Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB PSCo Senior Secured Debt A3 A PSCo Commercial Paper P2 A2 SPS Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB SPS Commercial Paper P2 A2 Note: Moodys highest credit rating for debt is Aaa1 and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3. Standard & Poors highest credit rating for debt is AAA+ and lowest investment grade rating is BBB . Moodys prime ratings for commercial paper range from P1 to P3. NP denotes a nonprime rating. Standard & Poors ratings for commercial paper range from A1 to A3, B and C. As of Feb. 17, 2005, Moodys had Xcel Energy and its operating utility subsidiaries on stable outlook. Standard & Poors also had Xcel Energy and its operating utility subsidiaries on stable outlook. In the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit rating triggers in its debt agreements. Money Pool In 2003, Xcel Energy established a money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The money pool allows for short term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates. The money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to the holding company. State regulatory commission approvals have been received for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS, and borrowing and lending activity for these utilities has commenced. On Jan. 18, 2005, NSP Wisconsin submitted a letter to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) withdrawing its request for approval to participate in the money pool arrangement after it became apparent the conditions likely to be imposed by the PSCW would have limited flexibility and reduced the economic benefits of NSP Wisconsins participation. The borrowings or loans outstanding at Dec. 31, 2004, and the SEC approved short term borrowing limits from the utility money pool are: Borrowings (Loans) Total Borrowing Limits NSP Minnesota $ 250 million PSCo $ 250 million SPS $ 100 million Registration Statements Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had approximately 400 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2004, Xcel Energy had approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities: In February 2002, Xcel Energy filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC. Xcel Energy may issue debt securities, common stock and rights to purchase common stock under this shelf registration. Xcel Energy has approximately $482.5 million remaining under this registration. Xcel Energy has approximately $400 million remaining under the $1 billion shelf registration filed with the SEC in 2000. 74 In April 2001, NSP Minnesota filed a $600 million, long term debt shelf registration with the SEC. NSP Minnesota has approximately $40 million remaining under this registration. PSCo has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $800 million of secured first collateral trust bonds or unsecured senior debt securities were registered. PSCo has approximately $225 million remaining under this registration. Future Financing Plans Xcel Energy generally expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through internally generated funds. Xcel Energy plans to renew its credit facilities at NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS during 2005 and may refinance existing long term debt or scheduled long term debt maturities based on prevailing market conditions. The renewal of the credit facilities at NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS is planned to be done with long term credit facilities for which borrowings would be reflected as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet. To facilitate its potential debt issuances, NSP Minnesota may file a long term debt shelf registration statement with the SEC for up to $1 billion in 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Xcel Energy does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
