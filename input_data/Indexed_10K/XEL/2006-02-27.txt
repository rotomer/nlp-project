Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL OVERVIEW Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy), a Minnesota corporation, is a public utility holding company. In 2005, Xcel Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 10 states. These utility subsidiaries are Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota corporation (NSP Minnesota); Northern States Power Co., a Wisconsin corporation (NSP Wisconsin); Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo); and Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS). These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WestGas InterState Inc. (WGI), an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies comprise our continuing regulated utility operations. Xcel Energys nonregulated subsidiaries reported in continuing operations include Eloigne Co. (investments in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax reported credits). Discontinued utility operations include Viking Gas Transmission Co. (Viking), an interstate natural gas pipeline company that was sold in January 2003; Black Mountain Gas Co. (BMG), a regulated natural gas and propane distribution company that was sold in October 2003; and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. (Cheyenne), a regulated electric and natural gas utility that was sold in January 2005. During 2003, Planergy International, Inc. (Planergy) (energy management solutions) closed, with final dissolution completed in 2004. Several nonregulated subsidiaries are presented as a component of discontinued operations. They include Utility Engineering (UE), an engineering, design and construction management firm; Quixx Corp., a former subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects; Seren Innovations, Inc. (Seren), a broadband communications services company; NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG), an independent power producer; Xcel Energy International, Inc., an international independent power producer; and e prime inc. (e prime), a natural gas marketing and trading company. Discontinued operations classifications are the result of sales or plans to sell by management. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Except for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, objective, outlook, plan, project, possible, potential, should and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including the availability of credit and its impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors, including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; the higher risk associated with Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses compared with its regulated businesses; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; actions of accounting regulatory bodies; the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Risk Factors in Item 1A of Xcel Energys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005 and Exhibit 99.01 to Xcel Energys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005. MANAGEMENTS STRATEGIC PLAN Xcel Energys strategy, which we call Building the Core, is to invest in our core utility businesses and earn the return authorized by our regulatory commissions. We plan to invest approximately $7 billion over the next five years in our core operations to grow our business in response to an increase in customer demand. We anticipate a need for additional energy supply in both Colorado and Minnesota during the next 15 years. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing the reliability of our electrical system, which includes making significant investment in our transmission and distribution systems. Over the past five years, weve divested 10 businesses or subsidiaries that were not closely linked to our core electric and natural gas businesses, realizing cash proceeds of nearly $440 million. Today, were a vertically integrated utility and we intend to stay that way. 52 Our strategy of Building the Core has three phases. The first phase is obtaining legislative and regulatory support for our large investment initiatives prior to making the investment. To avoid excessive risk for the company, it is critical to reduce regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments. We accomplished this for both the Metropoliton Emission Reduction Project (MERP) in Minnesota and the Comanche 3 coal plant in Colorado. Transmission legislation has been passed in Minnesota, allowing that states regulatory commission to approve recovery for transmission investments without filing a general rate case. In Texas, the legislature authorized annual recovery for transmission infrastructure improvements. Both pieces of legislation will support necessary new investment in our transmission system. The second phase is making those investments. In a normal year, we spend approximately $1 billion on capital projects. In addition to our base level of capital investment, we expect to spend approximately $1 billion on MERP and $1 billion on Comanche 3 through 2010. As a result of these investments, as well as continued investments in our transmission and distribution system, to ensure continued reliability and to meet our customer growth requirements, we expect that our rate base, or the amount on which we earn a return, will grow annually by slightly more than 4 percent on average. Finally, such investments will always be made with a clear focus on optimizing environmental protection, a significant priority for Xcel Energy. The third phase is earning a fair return on our investments. To ensure that we earn a fair return, our regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders as well as general rate cases. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows us to recover certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing a rate case. These riders allow for timely revenue recovery and are good mechanisms to recover the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time. As an example, a rider for MERP went into effect in January 2006, allowing us to earn a return on the project while the facility is being constructed. We also are filing general rate cases to increase revenue recovery in most of the states in which we operate. In 2005, we filed several rate cases as part of our regulatory strategy. These rate cases, and others that we plan to file in 2006, are some of the building blocks of our earnings growth plan. Following is the current status of these initiatives: We reached constructive decisions in the Colorado natural gas case and Wisconsin electric and natural gas cases, which will increase revenue in 2006 (see Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations for further discussion). We are on track with the Minnesota electric case, where interim rates, subject to refund, went into effect in January 2006. We expect a decision in the third quarter of this year. Later in the year we plan to file electric cases in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and possibly North Dakota and South Dakota. If we are successful, these cases should increase revenue and earnings in 2007. Our regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on our utility investments. We believe that our commissions will provide us with reasonable recovery, and its important to note that our financial plans include this assumption. Recent constructive results, along with past rulings, are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and give us confidence that we are pursuing the right strategy. With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. We feel the following financial objectives are both realistic and achievable: Annual earnings per share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent from 2005 2009; Annual dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and Senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Successful execution of our Building the Core strategic plan should allow us to achieve our financial objectives, which in turn should provide investors with an attractive total return on a low risk investment. FINANCIAL REVIEW The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes. All note references refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Financial Results The following table summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energys business segments on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Continuing operations consist of the following: Regulated utility subsidiaries, operating in the electric and natural gas segments; and Several nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company, where corporate financing activity occurs. 53 Discontinued operations consist of the following: Quixx Corp., which was classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2005 based on a decision to divest this investment; Utility Engineering Corp., which was sold in April 2005; Seren, a portion of which was sold in November 2005 with the remainder sold in January 2006; Viking and BMG, which were sold in 2003; Cheyenne, which was sold in January 2005; NRG, which emerged from bankruptcy and was divested in late 2003; and Xcel Energy International and e prime, which were classified as held for sale in late 2003 based on the decision to divest them. Certain items in the statements of operations have been reclassified from prior period presentation to conform to the 2005 presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of discontinued operations.

Included in All Other segment results in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Includes tax benefit related to NRG. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were lower than in 2004. The 2005 results had higher operating margins, which were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, including scheduled nuclear plant outages in 2005, higher employee benefit costs, higher uncollectible receivable expense and higher depreciation expense. In addition, tax expense recorded in 2005 was higher than 2004, primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded in 2004 related to the successful resolution of various income tax audit issues. While earnings from continuing operations for 2004 were flat compared with 2003, 2004 results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth, short term wholesale markets and lower depreciation, offset by the negative impact of unfavorable weather, legal settlement costs and the impact of certain regulatory accruals, compared with the same period in 2003. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 includes the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. This was partially offset by Serens operating losses during 2005. 54 The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 is largely due to an after tax impairment charge of $143 million, or 34 cents per share, related to Seren. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations in 2004 is attributable in part to an after tax loss of $13 million, or 3 cents per share, associated with the disposition of Cheyenne. The earnings in 2003 from discontinued operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously estimated tax benefits related to Xcel Energys write off of its investment in NRG. Results from discontinued operations are discussed in the Discontinued Operations section later. Weather Xcel Energys earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales, but may not reduce expenses. The impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically has used per degree of temperature. The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from historical averages: Weather in 2005 increased earnings by an estimated 3 cents per share; Weather in 2004 decreased earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share; and Weather in 2003 was close to normal and had minimal impact on earnings per share. Statement of Operations Analysis Continuing Operations The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Electric Utility, Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins Electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states, most fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect electric utility margin. Xcel Energy has two distinct forms of wholesale sales: short term wholesale and commodity trading. Short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity, and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for, and energy produced from, Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading is not associated with Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Short term wholesale and commodity trading activities are considered part of the electric utility segment. Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of regulatory sharing, if applicable. Commodity trading revenues are reported net of related costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Commodity trading costs include purchased power, transmission, broker fees and other related costs. 55 The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short term wholesale and commodity trading activities: (Millions of Dollars) Base Electric Utility Short Term Wholesale Commodity Trading Consolidated Totals 2005 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,038 $ 196 $ $ 7,234 Fuel and purchased power (3,802 ) (120 ) (3,922 ) Commodity trading revenue 730 730 Commodity trading costs (720 ) (720 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,236 $ 76 $ 10 $ 3,322 Margin as a percentage of revenue 46.0 % 38.8 % 1.4 % 41.7 % 2004 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 5,989 $ 220 $ $ 6,209 Fuel and purchased power (2,916 ) (125 ) (3,041 ) Commodity trading revenue 610 610 Commodity trading costs (594 ) (594 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,073 $ 95 $ 16 $ 3,184 Margin as a percentage of revenue 51.3 % 43.2 % 2.6 % 46.7 % 2003 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 5,724 $ 179 $ $ 5,903 Fuel and purchased power (2,588 ) (118 ) (2,706 ) Commodity trading revenue 333 333 Commodity trading costs (316 ) (316 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,136 $ 61 $ 17 $ 3,214 Margin as a percentage of revenue 54.8 % 34.1 % 5.1 % 51.5 % The following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Base Electric Utility Revenue (Millions of Dollars) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ 57 $ 73 Estimated impact of weather 91 (74 ) Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 706 230 Firm wholesale 67 62 Capacity sales 15 (2 ) Quality of service obligations 7 (12 ) Conservation and non fuel riders 16 (5 ) Texas fuel reconciliation settlement 21 (25 ) Other 69 18 Total base electric utility revenue increase $ 1,049 $ 265 2005 Comparison with 2004 Base electric revenues increased due to higher fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely recovered from customers; weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.4 percent; higher sales attributable to warmer than normal summer temperatures in 2005; higher revenues from firm wholesale customers and lower regulatory accruals related to the Texas fuel reconciliation settlement. 56 2004 Comparison with 2003 Base electric utility revenues increased due to higher fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely recovered from customers; weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent; and higher revenues from firm wholesale customers. Partially offsetting the higher revenues was the impact of significantly cooler summer temperatures in 2004, compared with the summer of 2003, as well as estimated customer refunds related to quality of service obligations in Colorado and the estimated Texas fuel reconciliation settlement. Base Electric Utility Margin (Millions of Dollars) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Estimated impact of weather on sales $ 75 $ (56 ) Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 42 55 Conservation and non fuel revenue 16 (6 ) Texas fuel reconciliation settlement 21 (25 ) Quality of service obligations 7 (12 ) Under recovery of fuel costs (NSP Wisconsin) (15 ) (10 ) Under recovery and timing of recovery of fuel costs (other jurisdictions) (14 ) (20 ) Firm wholesale 23 27 Pricing and other 8 (16 ) Total base electric utility margin increase (decrease) $ 163 $ (63 ) 2005 Comparison to 2004 Base electric utility margin increased due to the impact of weather, weather normalized sales growth, higher firm wholesale margins, higher conservation and non fuel rider revenues and lower accruals related to the fuel reconciliation proceedings in Texas, partially offset by higher amortization expense and lower regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in Colorado. These increases were partially offset by higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms. 2004 Comparison to 2003 Base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather, higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms, and regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in Colorado and fuel reconciliation proceedings in Texas. These decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin 2005 Comparison to 2004 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased $25 million for 2005 compared with 2004. The higher 2004 results reflect the impact of more favorable market conditions and higher levels of surplus generation available to sell. In addition, a preexisting contract contributed $17 million of margin in the first quarter of 2004 and expired at that time. 2004 Comparison to 2003 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately $33 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase reflects a number of market factors, including higher market prices and additional resources available for sale and the pre existing contract described above. Natural Gas Utility Margins The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. See further discussion under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations. (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Natural gas utility revenue $ 2,307 $ 1,916 $ 1,678 Cost of natural gas purchased and transported (1,823 ) (1,446 ) (1,191 ) Natural gas utility margin $ 484 $ 470 $ 487 57 The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Natural Gas Revenue (Millions of Dollars) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ $ (3 ) Purchased natural gas adjustment clause recovery 397 257 Rate changes Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota 6 (15 ) Estimated impact of weather (5 ) (10 ) Transportation and other (7 ) 9 Total natural gas revenue increase $ 391 $ 238 2005 Comparison to 2004 Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs in 2005, which are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales were flat when compared to 2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage. 2004 Comparison to 2003 Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs in 2004, which are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales declined in 2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage. Natural Gas Margin (Millions of Dollars) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) $ 1 $ Estimated impact of weather on firm sales (2 ) (5 ) Rate changes Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota 6 (15 ) Transportation 6 1 Other 3 2 Total natural gas margin increase (decrease) $ 14 $ (17 ) 2005 Comparison to 2004 Natural gas margin increased due to rate changes in Minnesota and North Dakota, and higher transportation margins, partially offset by the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2005 compared with 2004. 2004 Comparison to 2003 Natural gas margin decreased due to a full year of a base rate decrease in Colorado, which was effective July 1, 2003, and the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2004 compared with 2003. Nonregulated Operating Margins The following table details the changes in nonregulated revenue and margin included in continuing operations: (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Nonregulated and other revenue $ 74 $ 75 $ 134 Nonregulated cost of goods sold (25 ) (29 ) (81 ) Nonregulated margin $ 49 $ 46 $ 53 2004 Comparison to 2003 Nonregulated revenue decreased in 2004, due primarily to the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned. Non Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items Other Utility Operating and Maintenance Expenses Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2005 increased by approximately $87 million, or 5.5 percent, compared with 2004. An outage at the Monticello nuclear plant and higher outage costs at Prairie Island in 2005 increased costs by approximately $26 million. Employee benefit costs were higher in 2005, primarily due to increased pension benefits and long term disability costs. Also contributing to the increase was higher uncollectible receivable costs, attributable in part, to modifications to the bankruptcy laws, higher fuel prices and certain changes in the credit and collection process. 58 Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2004 increased by approximately $21 million, or 1.4 percent, compared with 2003. Of the increase, $12 million was incurred to assist with the storm damage repair in Florida and was offset by increased revenue. The remaining increase of $9 million is primarily due to higher electric service reliability costs, higher information technology costs, higher plant related costs, higher costs related to a customer billing system conversion and increased costs primarily related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The higher costs were partially offset by lower employee benefit and compensation costs and lower nuclear plant outage costs. (Millions of Dollars) 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 Higher (lower) employee benefit costs $ 31 $ (12 ) Higher (lower) nuclear plant outage costs 26 (13 ) Higher uncollectible receivable costs 19 2 Higher donations to energy assistance programs 4 1 Higher mutual aid assistance costs 1 12 Higher electric service reliability costs 9 9 Higher (lower) information technology costs (6 ) 8 Higher (lower) plant related costs (7 ) 4 Higher costs related to customer billing system conversion 4 4 Higher costs to comply with Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 4 Other 6 2 Total operating and maintenance expense increase $ 87 $ 21 Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance Expenses Other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million, or 35.4 percent, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the accrual of $18 million in 2004 for a settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits. Other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased $9 million, or 17.5 percent, in 2004 compared with 2003. This decrease resulted from the dissolution of Planergy International and the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned after the divestiture of NRG. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for 2005 increased by approximately $61 million, or 8.7 percent, compared with 2004. The changes were primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at Unit 1 of the Prairie Island nuclear plant and software system additions, both of which have relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions. The Prairie Island steam generators are being depreciated over the remaining life of the plant operating license, which expires in 2013. In addition, the Minnesota Renewable Development Fund and renewable cost recovery amortization, which is recovered in revenue as a non fuel rider and does not have an impact on net income, increased over 2004. The increase was partially offset by the changes in useful lives and net salvage rates approved by Minnesota regulators in August 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2004 decreased by $21 million, or 2.9 percent, compared with 2003. The reduction is largely due to several regulatory decisions. In 2004, as a result of a Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) order, NSP Minnesota modified its decommissioning expense recognition, which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by approximately $18 million in 2004 compared with 2003. In addition, effective July 1, 2003, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility plant at PSCo as a part of the general Colorado rate case, reducing annual depreciation expense by $20 million. PSCo experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in 2004, resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $10 million for 2004 compared with 2003. These decreases were partially offset by plant additions. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Net Interest and other income (expense) net decreased $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior period IRS audits of $10.5 million in 2004, partially offset by a $2.2 million gain on the sale of water rights in 2005. Interest and other income, net of nonoperating expenses increased $15 million in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase is due mostly to interest income related to the finalization of prior period IRS audits of $10.5 million. Interest and Financing Costs The 2005 interest charges and financing costs increased approximately $8 million, or 1.9 percent when compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short term borrowing levels. The 2004 interest charges and financing costs decreased approximately $17 million, or 3.7 percent when compared with 2003. The decrease for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during 2003 and lower credit line fees, partially offset by interest expense related to prior period IRS audits. 59 Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 25.8 percent for 2005, compared with 23.7 percent in 2004. Income taxes recorded in 2005 reflect tax benefits of $10.0 million, primarily from increased research credits and a net operating loss carry back. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate for 2005 would have been 27.3 percent. In 2004, income tax benefits of $37.1 million were recorded, which included $22.3 million related to the successful resolution of various audit issues and other adjustments to current and deferred taxes. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 23.7 percent for 2004, compared with 24.6 percent for the same period in 2003. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate for 2004 would have been 29.1 percent. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Holding Company and Other Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses and holding company results: (Millions of Dollars) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings 2005 2004 2003 Eloigne Company $ 6.2 $ 8.5 $ 7.7 Financing costs holding company (52.7 ) (44.7 ) (44.1 ) Holding company and other results 6.2 (2.2 ) Total nonregulated/holding company loss continuing operations $ (40.3 ) $ (36.2 ) $ (38.6 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings per share 2005 2004 2003 Eloigne Company $ 0.01 $ 0.02 $ 0.02 Financing costs and preferred dividends holding company (0.09 ) (0.08 ) (0.09 ) Holding company and other results 0.01 Total nonregulated/holding company loss per share continuing operations $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends Nonregulated results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. The earnings per share impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2005, 2004 and 2003 included above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the dilutive securities, if converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately $14 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2005; $15 million, or 4 cents per share, in 2004; and $11 million, or 3 cents per share, in 2003. 60 Statement of Operations Analysis Discontinued Operations (Net of Tax) A summary of the various components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended Dec. 31: 2005 2004 2003 Income (loss) in millions Viking Gas Transmission Co. $ $ 1.3 $ 21.9 Black Mountain Gas 2.4 Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power Co. 0.2 (10.3 ) 2.5 Regulated utility segments income (loss) 0.2 (9.0 ) 26.8 NRG segment loss (1.1 ) (251.4 ) NRG related tax benefits (expense) 17.2 (12.8 ) 404.4 Xcel Energy International 0.1 7.3 (45.5 ) e prime (0.1 ) (1.8 ) (17.8 ) Seren 1.8 (156.6 ) (18.3 ) Utility Engineering, Corp. / Quixx Corp.

Consequently, Xcel Energy reported Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued in December 2004. During 2003, Xcel Energy sold Viking and BMG. After tax disposal gains of $23.3 million, or 6 cents per share, were recorded, primarily related to the sale of Viking. Xcel Energy recorded minimal income related to Viking in 2003, due to its sale in January of that year. NRG Results Discontinued Operations Xcel Energys share of NRG results for 2003 is shown as a component of discontinued operations due to NRGs emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003 and Xcel Energys corresponding divestiture of its ownership interest in NRG. Xcel Energy financial statements do not contain any results of NRG operations in 2005 and 2004. 61 NRGs results included in Xcel Energys earnings for 2003 were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Six months ended June 30, 2003 Total NRG loss $ (621 ) Losses not recorded by Xcel Energy under the equity method* 370 Equity in losses of NRG included in Xcel Energy results for 2003 $ (251 ) * These represent NRG losses incurred in the first and second quarters of 2003 that were in excess of the amounts recordable by Xcel Energy under the equity method of accounting limitations. As of the bankruptcy filing date (May 14, 2003), Xcel Energy had recognized $263 million of NRGs impairments and related charges as these charges were recorded by NRG prior to May 14, 2003. Consequently, Xcel Energy recorded its equity in NRG results in excess of its financial commitment to NRG under the settlement agreement reached in March 2003 among Xcel Energy, NRG and NRGs creditors. These excess losses were reversed upon NRGs emergence from bankruptcy in December 2003. Other Nonregulated Results Discontinued Operations In April 2005, Zachry Group, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE, a nonregulated subsidiary. In August 2005, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to pursue the sale of Quixx Corp., a former subsidiary of UE that partners in cogeneration projects that was not included in the sale of UE to Zachry. As a result, Xcel Energy is reporting UE and Quixx as components of discontinued operations for all periods presented. In September 2004, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to pursue the sale of Seren. As a result of the decision, Seren is accounted for as discontinued operations. In November 2005, Xcel Energy sold Serens California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC. In January 2006, Xcel Energy sold Serens Minnesota assets to Charter Communications. During 2003, Xcel Energys board of directors approved managements plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and Xcel Energy International. e prime ceased conducting business in 2004. Also during 2004, Xcel Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International. 2005 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2004 Results of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2005 include the impact of a $5 million reduction to the original asset impairment for Seren and the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. In 2004, the NRG tax basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $13 million. 2004 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2003 Results of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2004 include the impact of the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International. The sales were completed in three transactions, with a total sales price of approximately $31 million. In addition to the sales price, Xcel Energy also received approximately $21 million at the closing of one transaction as redemption of its capital investment. The sales resulted in a gain of approximately $8 million, including approximately $7 million of income tax benefits realizable upon the sale of the Xcel Energy International assets. In addition, 2004 results from discontinued operations include the impact of an after tax impairment charge for Seren, of $143 million, or 34 cents per share. The impairment charge was recorded based on operating results, market conditions and preliminary feedback from prospective buyers. Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits related to the divestiture of NRG. Since these tax benefits are related to Xcel Energys investment in discontinued NRG operations, they are reported as discontinued operations. During 2002, Xcel Energy recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of $706 million. Based on the results of a 2003 preliminary tax basis study of NRG, Xcel Energy recorded $404 million of additional tax benefits in 2003. In 2004, the NRG basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $13 million. In 2005, a $17 million tax benefit was recorded to reflect the final federal income tax resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. 62 Based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Xcel Energy used $24 million, $345 million, and $116 million, respectively, of these tax benefits, and expects to use $180 million in 2006. The remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years. Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energys ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. The United States economy continues to grow as measured by projected growth in the gross domestic product. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates. Sales Growth In addition to the impact of weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energys utility businesses can vary with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and other factors. Weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was 1.4 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, and 1.8 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. Weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was approximately 0.2 percent in 2005 compared with 2004, and (1.9) percent in 2004 compared with 2003. Projections indicate that weather normalized sales growth in 2006 compared with 2005 will range between 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent for retail electric utility customers and 0.0 percent to 1.0 percent for firm natural gas utility customers. Fuel Supply and Costs Coal Deliverability Xcel Energys operating utilities have varying dependence on coal fired generation. At the utilities, coal fired generation comprises between 60 percent and 85 percent of the total annual generation. Approximately 70 percent of the annual coal requirements are supplied from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Delivery of coal from the Powder River Basin has been disrupted by train derailments and other operational problems purportedly caused by deteriorated rail track beds of approximately 140 miles in length in Wyoming. The BNSF Railway Co. (BNSF) and the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) jointly own the rail line. The BNSF operates and maintains the rail line. The coal delivery issues began in the first half of 2005. Based on discussions with the railroads, Xcel Energy expects that disrupted coal deliveries will continue at least through the first part of 2006. Xcel Energy has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of the reduced coal deliveries. These steps include modifying the dispatch of certain generation facilities to conserve coal inventories. This modified dispatch was in place during the second half of 2005 and has continued in 2006 to date. In response to this reduced coal dispatch, Xcel Energy has increased purchases from third parties and has increased the use of natural gas for electric generation. In addition, Xcel Energy negotiated for the acquisition of additional, higher capacity rail cars and is working to upgrade certain coal handling facilities. Delivery of the new cars began in January 2006 and will continue over the course of the year. The upgrades to the coal handling facilities are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006. Despite these efforts, coal inventories have declined to below target levels. While Xcel Energy has secured, under contract, approximately 99 percent of anticipated 2006 coal requirements, it cannot predict the likelihood of receiving the required coal. While Xcel Energy is planning to rebuild inventories during the year, there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so. The ultimate impact of coal availability cannot be fully assessed at this time, but could impact future financial results. The cost of purchased power and natural gas for electric generation is higher than for coal fired electric generation. The use of these sources to replace coal fired electric generation increased the price of electricity for retail and wholesale customers. 63 Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries have discussed this situation with their respective state regulatory commissions. In Colorado, PSCo is subject to a retail electric adjustment clause that recovers fuel, purchased energy and resource costs. The Electric Commodity Adjustment (ECA) is an incentive adjustment mechanism that compares actual fuel and purchased energy expenses in a calendar year to a benchmark formula. The benchmark formula increases with natural gas prices, but not necessarily with increased volumes of natural gas usage due to coal supply disruption. Therefore, any disruption in coal supply could adversely affect fuel cost recovery. For 2005, PSCo recorded an incentive accrual of $8.5 million. The ECA provides for an $11.25 million cap on any cost sharing over or under the allowed ECA formula rate. Any cost in excess of the $11.25 million cap is completely recovered from customers, while any savings in excess of the $11.25 million cap is completely refunded to customers. Subject to the terms of the ECA, PSCo anticipates it would recover any increased fuel and purchased energy costs greater than the cap from its customers. Natural gas prices in 2005 were higher than projected when the ECA tariff rates were set in January 2005. On Oct. 5, 2005, PSCo filed an application to adjust the ECA rate for November and December 2005 to reduce the ECA deferred balance and to update its projection of natural gas prices. This application was granted, which resulted in an increase to 2005 electric revenue of approximately $70 million, including unbilled revenues. As of Dec. 31, 2005, PSCo was carrying a deferred ECA balance, including unbilled revenue, of approximately $15 million. In Texas, fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor, which is part of SPS retail electric rates. If SPS will materially over recover or under recover these costs, the factor may be revised upon application by SPS or action by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT). The regulations require surcharging of under recovered amounts, including interest, when they exceed 4 percent of SPS annual fuel and purchased energy costs, as allowed by the PUCT, if the condition is expected to continue. On Dec. 21, 2005 SPS reached a settlement with various parties that set the fuel surcharge request at $76.9 million, to be recovered over a 15 month period. The PUCT approved this settlement on Feb. 9, 2006, and the surcharge went into effect Feb. 13, 2006. In New Mexico, increases and decreases in fuel and purchased energy costs, including deferred amounts, are recovered through a monthly fuel and purchased power clause with a two month lag. Wholesale customers, under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction also pay a monthly fuel cost adjustment calculated on actual fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the FERCs fuel clause regulations. While SPS believes that it should be allowed to recover these higher costs, the ultimate success of recovery could significantly impact the future of SPS and possibly Xcel Energy. NSP Minnesotas retail electric rate schedules in the Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota jurisdictions include a fuel clause adjustment (FCA) to billings and revenues for changes in prudently incurred cost of fuel, fuel related items and purchased energy. NSP Minnesota is permitted to recover these costs through FCA mechanisms individually approved by the regulators in each jurisdiction. The FCA mechanisms allow NSP Minnesota to bill customers for the cost of fuel and fuel related items used to generate electricity at its plants and energy purchased from other suppliers. In general, capacity costs are not recovered through the FCA. NSP Minnesotas electric wholesale customers also have a FCA provision in their contracts. NSP Minnesota anticipates it will recover increased costs resulting from its mitigation plan through the FCA. In Wisconsin, NSP Wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel clause adjustment for Wisconsin retail customers. NSP Wisconsin may seek deferred accounting treatment and future rate recovery of increased costs due to an emergency event, if that event causes fuel and purchased power costs to exceed the amount included in rates on an annual basis by more than 2 percent. Coal deliverability has not resulted in an emergency event to date. Natural Gas Costs A variety of market factors have contributed to significantly higher natural gas prices. The direct impact of these higher costs is generally mitigated for Xcel Energy through recovery of such costs from customers through various fuel cost recovery mechanisms. However, higher fuel costs could significantly impact the results of operations, if requests for recovery are unsuccessful. In addition, the higher fuel costs could reduce customer demand or increase bad debt expense, which could also have a material impact on Xcel Energys results of operations. Delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures for fuel purchases are expected to have an impact on the cash flows of Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy is unable to predict the future natural gas prices or the ultimate impact of such prices on its results of operations or cash flows. 64 Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements. Pension costs have been increasing in recent years, and are expected to increase further over the next several years, due to lower than expected investment returns experienced in prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit obligations. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 8.75 percent in 2005, 9.0 percent in 2004 and 9.25 percent in 2003, investment returns in 2002 and 2001 were below the assumed level of 9.5 percent, and discount rates have declined from the 7.25 percent to 8 percent levels used in the 1999 through 2002 cost determinations, to 6.0 percent used in 2005. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and, in 2006, expects to maintain the investment return assumption at 8.75 percent and to lower the discount rate assumption to 5.75 percent. The investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period. This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year, moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost determination process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period. Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will increase from a credit, or negative expense, of $2.4 million in 2005 to an expense of $15.3 million in 2006 and $18.7 million in 2007. Pension costs were a credit in 2005 due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding the other pension cost components, such as benefits earned for current service and interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted obligations. Xcel Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), and has consistently benchmarked the interest rate used to derive the discount rate to the movements in the long term corporate bond indices for bonds rated Aaa through Baa by Moodys, which have a period to maturity comparable to our projected benefit obligations. At Dec. 31, 2005, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.21 percent, and the Aaa index rate was 5.26 percent. Accordingly, Xcel Energy lowered the discount rate to 5.75 percent as of Dec. 31, 2005. This rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2006 pension cost determinations. At Dec. 31, 2004, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.10 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.43 percent. The corresponding pension discount rate was 6.00 percent. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a 1 percent change would result in the following impact on the estimated pension costs recognized by Xcel Energy: A 100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75 percent, would decrease 2006 recognized pension costs by $17.0 million; A 100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75 percent, would increase 2006 recognized pension costs by $17.0 million; A 100 basis point higher discount rate, 6.75 percent, would decrease 2006 recognized pension costs by $5.4 million; and A 100 basis point lower discount rate, 4.75 percent, would increase 2006 recognized pension costs by $7.1 million. Alternative Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding assumptions would also change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans. Cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions, actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension related regulations. These regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for Xcel Energys pension plans, and do not require funding in 2006. Assuming that future asset return levels equal the actuarial assumption of 8.75 percent for the years 2006 and 2007, Xcel Energy projects, under current funding regulations, that no cash funding would be required for 2006 or 2007. Actual performance can affect these funding requirements significantly. Current funding regulations are under legislative review in 2006 and, if not retained in their current form, could change these funding requirements materially. 65 Regulation Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) Historically, Xcel Energy has been a registered holding company under the PUHCA. As a registered holding company, Xcel Energy, its utility subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries have been subject to extensive regulation by the SEC under the PUHCA with respect to numerous matters, including issuances and sales of securities, acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties, payments of dividends out of capital and surplus, and intra system sales of certain nonpower goods and services. In addition, the PUHCA generally limited the ability of registered holding companies to acquire additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company. On Aug. 8, 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act), significantly changing many federal statutes and repealing the PUHCA as of Feb. 8, 2006. However, as part of the repeal of the PUHCA, the FERC was given authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries to the extent relevant to the charges of jurisdictional utilities, authority to review service company cost allocations, and more authority over the merger and acquisition of public utilities. With the repeal of PUHCA, state commissions were given similar authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries. Despite these increases in the FERCs authority, Xcel Energy believes that the repeal of the PUHCA will lessen its regulatory burdens and give it more flexibility in the event it were to choose to expand its utility or nonutility businesses. Besides repealing the PUHCA, the Energy Act is also expected to have substantial long term effects on energy markets, energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding company systems by the FERC and DOE. The FERC and the DOE are in various stages of rulemaking in implementing the Energy Policy Act. While the precise impact of these rulemakings cannot be determined at this time, Xcel Energy generally views the Energy Act as legislation that will enhance the utility industry going forward. Customer Rate Regulation The FERC and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, conservation and demand side management efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. The most recently authorized electric utility returns are 11.47 percent for NSP Minnesota; 11.0 percent for NSP Wisconsin; 10.75 percent for PSCo; and 11.5 percent for SPS. The most recently authorized natural gas utility returns are 10.4 percent for NSP Minnesota, 11.0 percent for NSP Wisconsin and 10.5 percent for PSCo. Wholesale Energy Market Regulation In April 2005, a Day 2 wholesale energy market operated by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) was implemented to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. MISO now centrally issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin. Both bills and payments from MISO for participation in this centrally dispatched market are received, resulting in a net cost in serving Xcel Energys native load obligation. This net result is recorded as a component of operating and maintenance expenses. The MPUC issued an interim order in April 2005 allowing MISO Day 2 charges to be recovered through the NSP Minnesota Fuel Clause Adjustment (FCA) mechanism. In December 2005, the MPUC issued a second interim order approving the recovery of certain MISO charges through the FCA mechanism but requiring that additional charges either be recovered as part of a general rate case or through an annual review process outside the FCA mechanism, and requiring refunds of non FCA costs. However, the December 2005 MPUC order also suspended the refund obligation until such time as it could reconsider the matter. On Feb. 9, 2006, the MPUC voted to reconsider its December 2005 order. The MPUC on reconsideration determined that parties be directed to determine which charges are appropriately in the FCA and which are more appropriately established in base rates and report back to the MPUC in 60 days; to grant deferred accounting treatment for costs ultimately determined to be included in base rates for a period of 36 months, with recovery of deferred amounts to be reviewed in a general rate case; and that amounts collected to date through the FCA under the April and December 2005 interim orders are not subject to refund. As a result, NSP Minnesota will be allowed to recover its prudently incurred MISO costs either through existing fuel clause mechanisms or in base rates. In March 2005, the PSCW issued an interim order allowing NSP Wisconsin deferred accounting treatment of MISO charges. However, the PSCW staff issued an interpretive memorandum in October 2005 asserting that certain MISO costs may not be recovered through the interim fuel cost mechanism and may not be deferrable. 66 NSP Wisconsin and the other Wisconsin utilities contested the PSCWs interpretation in their November comments to the PSCW. To date, NSP Wisconsin has deferred approximately $5.7 million of MISO Day 2 costs as a regulatory asset. Xcel Energy has notified MISO that NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin may seek to withdraw from MISO if rate recovery of Day 2 costs is not allowed. Withdrawal would require FERC approval and could require Xcel Energy to pay a withdrawal fee. In addition, pursuant to FERC orders, NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin are billed for certain MISO Day 2 charges associated with the loads of certain wholesale transmission service customers taking service under pre MISO grandfathered agreements (GFAs). In March 2005, Xcel Energy filed for the FERCs approval to pass through these charges to GFA customers. FERC accepted the filing subject to refund and hearing procedures. In 2005, NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin were billed for $1.1 million of MISO charges, which have not yet been recovered from GFA customers. The likelihood of full rate recovery is uncertain at this time. In addition, Xcel Energy has filed an appeal of the FERC orders. Capital Expenditure Regulation Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy distribution system. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, in 2003 the CPUC and MPUC approved proposals to recover, through a rate surcharge, certain costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions in the Denver and Minneapolis St. Paul metropolitan areas. These rate recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. Future Cost Recovery Regulated public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods, and to record as regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. In contrast, nonregulated enterprises would expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period. If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. Such changes could have a material effect on Xcel Energys results of operations in the period the write off is recorded. At Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $963 million and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion that would be recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities, restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals. Pending and Recently Concluded Regulatory Proceedings NSP Minnesota Electric Rate Case In November 2005, NSP Minnesota requested an electric rate increase of $168 million or 8.05 percent. This increase was based on a requested 11 percent return on common equity, a projected common equity ratio to total capitalization of 51.7 percent and a projected electric rate base of $3.2 billion. On Dec. 15, 2005, the MPUC authorized an interim rate increase of $147 million, subject to refund, which became effective on Jan. 1, 2006. The anticipated procedural schedule is as follows: March 2nd Intervenor Direct Testimony March 30th Rebuttal Testimony April 13th Surrebuttal Testimony April 20th April 28th Evidentiary Hearings May 24th Initial Briefs June 6th Reply Briefs July 6th Administrative Law Judge Report September 5th MPUC Order NSP Wisconsin 2006 General Rate Case In 2005, NSP Wisconsin, requested an electric revenue increase of $58.3 million and a natural gas revenue increase of $8.1 million, based on a 2006 test year, an 11.9 percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of 56.32 percent. On Jan. 5, 2006, the PSCW approved an electric revenue increase of $43.4 million and a natural gas revenue increase of $3.9 million, based on an 11.0 percent return on equity and a 54 percent common equity ratio target. The new rates were effective Jan. 9, 2006. The order authorized the deferral of an additional $6.5 million in costs related to nuclear decommissioning and manufactured gas plant site clean up for recovery in the next rate case. The order also prohibits NSP Wisconsin from paying dividends above $42.7 million, if its actual calendar year average common equity 67 ratio is or will fall below 54.03 percent. It also imposes an asymmetrical electric fuel clause bandwidth of positive 2 percent to negative 0.5 percent outside of which NSP Wisconsin would be permitted to request or be required to change rates. PSCo Natural Gas Rate Case In 2005, PSCo filed for an increase of $34.5 million in natural gas base rates in Colorado, based on a return on equity of 11.0 percent with a common equity ratio of 55.49 percent. On Jan. 19, 2006, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement between PSCo and other parties to the case. Final rates became effective Feb. 6, 2006. The terms of the settlement include: Natural gas revenue increase of $22 million; Return on common equity of 10.5 percent; Earnings over 10.5 percent return on common equity will be refunded back to customers; Common equity ratio of 55.49 percent; and Customer charges for the residential and commercial sales classes of $10 and $20 per month, respectively. Tax Matters Interest Expense Deductibility PSCos wholly owned subsidiary, PSR Investments, Inc. (PSRI), owns and manages permanent life insurance policies, known as COLI policies, on some of PSCos employees. At various times, borrowings have been made against the cash values of these COLI policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these borrowings. The IRS has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years 1993 through 1999. Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31, 2005, would reduce earnings by an estimated $361 million. In 2004, Xcel Energy received formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated interest) are also included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2005, is approximately $428 million. Xcel Energy estimates its annual earnings for 2006 would be reduced by $44 million, after tax, which represents 10 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no longer available. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. COLI Dow Chemical Court Decision On Jan. 23, 2006, the 6th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion in a federal income tax case involving the interest deductions for a COLI program at Dow Chemical Company. The 6th Circuit denied the tax deductions and reversed the decision of the trial court in the case. Xcel Energy has analyzed the impact of the Dow decision on its pending COLI litigation and concluded there are significant factual differences between its case and the Dow case. The courts opinion in the Dow case outlined three indicators of potential economic benefits to be examined in a COLI case and noted that the outcome of COLI cases is very fact determinative. These indicators are: Positive pre deduction cash flows; Mortality gains; and The buildup of cash values. In a split decision, the 6th Circuit found that the Dow COLI plans possessed none of these indicators of economic substance. However, in Xcel Energys COLI case, the plans were projected to have sizeable pre deduction cash flows, based upon the relevant assumptions when purchased. Moreover, the plans presented the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively. Xcel Energys COLI plans had no provision for giving back any mortality gains that it might realize. In addition, Xcel Energys plans had large cash value increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the policies. Consequently, Xcel Energy believes that the facts and circumstances of its case are stronger than Dows case and continues to believe its case has strong merits. Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately: 68 $147 million in 2005; $133 million in 2004; and $133 million in 2003. Xcel Energy expects to expense an average of approximately $176 million per year from 2006 through 2010 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain. Capital expenditures placed in service on environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $37.1 million in 2005; $20.9 million in 2004; and $58.5 million in 2003. The regulated utilities expect to incur approximately $438 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in 2006, and approximately $714 million of related expenditures during the period from 2007 through 2010. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Approximately $347 million and $392 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of NSP Minnesotas generating plants located in the Minneapolis St. Paul metropolitan area pursuant to the MERP, which are recoverable from customers through cost recovery mechanisms. Expected expenditures related to environmental modifications on Comanche Units 1 and 2 are approximately $26 million in 2006 and $62 million during the period from 2007 through 2010. The remaining expected capital expenditures relate to various other environmental projects. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. The issue of global climate change is receiving increased attention. Debate continues concerning the extent to which the earths climate is warming, the causes of climate variations that have been observed and the ultimate impact that might result from a changing climate. There also is considerable debate regarding public policy for the approach that the United States should follow to address the issue. The United Nations sponsored Kyoto Protocol, which establishes greenhouse gas reduction targets for developed nations, entered into force on Feb. 16, 2005. President Bush has declared that the United States will not ratify the protocol and is opposed to legislative mandates, preferring a program based on voluntary efforts and research on new technologies. Xcel Energy is closely monitoring the issue from both scientific and policy perspectives. While it is not possible to know the eventual outcome, Xcel Energy believes the issue merits close attention and is taking actions it believes are prudent to be best positioned for a variety of possible outcomes. Xcel Energy is participating in a voluntary carbon management program and has established goals to reduce its volume of carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tons by 2009, and to reduce carbon intensity by 7 percent by 2012. In certain regulatory jurisdictions, the evaluation process for future generating resources incorporates the risk of future carbon limits through the use of a carbon cost adder or externality costs. Xcel Energy also is involved in other projects to improve available methods for managing carbon. Impact of Nonregulated Investments In the past, Xcel Energys investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its results. Xcel Energy does not expect to make any material investments in nonregulated projects. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, 69 legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors. 70 Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application See Additional Discussion At Regulatory Mechanisms and Cost Recovery Anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact External regulatory decisions, requirements and regulatory environment Impact of deregulation and competition on ratemaking process and ability to recover costs Managements Discussion and Analysis: Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Regulation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Notes 1, 14 and 16 Nuclear Plant Decommissioning and Cost Recovery Costs of future decommissioning Availability of facilities for waste disposal Approved methods for waste disposal Useful lives of nuclear power plants Future recovery of plant investment and decommissioning costs Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Notes 1, 14 and 15 Income Tax Accruals Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Ability of tax authority decisions/positions to withstand legal challenges and appeals Ability to realize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods or carry overs to future periods Managements Discussion and Analysis: Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Tax Matters Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Notes 1, 8 and 14 Benefit Plan Accounting Future rate of return on pension and other plan assets, including impact of any changes to investment portfolio composition Discount rates used in valuing benefit obligation Actuarial period selected to recognize deferred investment gains and losses Managements Discussion and Analysis: Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Notes 1 and 10 Asset Valuation Regional economic conditions affecting asset operation, market prices and related cash flows Regulatory and political environments and requirements Levels of future market penetration and customer growth Managements Discussion and Analysis: Results of Operations Statement of Operations Analysis Discontinued Operations Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Impact of Nonregulated Investments Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2 Xcel Energy continually makes informed judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. For example: 71 Probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from regulators. The ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their useful operating lives, or such other period designated by Xcel Energys regulators, is assumed. Probable outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities, including appeals and litigation where necessary, are assessed. Projections are made regarding earnings on pension investments, and the salary increases provided to employees over their periods of service. Future cash inflows of operations are projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future cash outflows, including the impact of product price changes and market penetration to customer groups. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2005. Recently Implemented Accounting Changes For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pending Accounting Changes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (Revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R related to equity based compensation. This statement replaces the original SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under SFAS No. 123R, companies are no longer allowed to account for their share based payment awards using the intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements, which did not require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or greater than fair market value exercise price. Instead, equity based compensation arrangements will be measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value using an option pricing model (such as Black Scholes or Binomial) that considers at least six factors identified in SFAS No. 123R. An expense related to the difference between the grant date fair value and the purchase price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options. Under previous guidance, companies were allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually occurred. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures will differ from previous estimates. Revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision occurs. Previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met. However, under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the companys failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed. Any accruals made for Xcel Energys restricted stock unit plan that were granted in 2004 and based on a total shareholder return could not be reversed if the target was not met. Implementation of SFAS No. 123R is required for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Xcel Energy is required to adopt the provisions in the first quarter of 2006. Implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income or earnings per share. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions In July 2004, the FASB discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition of income tax benefits, which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits that have some degree of uncertainty. In July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions under SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. As issued, the exposure draft would have been effective Dec. 31, 2005, and only tax benefits that meet the probable recognition threshold would be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date. Initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Subsequent to the comment period that closed in September 2005, the FASB announced that the effective date of its new interpretation will be delayed, with a revised pronouncement to be released no earlier than the first quarter of 2006. In redeliberations in November 2005, the FASB decided that the benefit recognition approach in the exposure draft should be retained, but that the initial recognition threshold should be more likely than not rather than probable. In redeliberations on Jan. 11, 2006, the FASB addressed the issues of transition and effective date. For Xcel Energy, the new interpretation, if and when issued, is likely to be effective beginning Jan. 1, 2007, with any cumulative effect of the change reflected in retained earnings. 72 Although Xcel Energy has not assessed the impact of a new recognition threshold on all of its open tax positions, based on available information, it believes that its COLI tax position meets the more likely than not threshold, and therefore it plans to continue to recognize all COLI tax benefits in full. See Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Tax Matters for further discussion of this matter. DERIVATIVES, RISK MANAGEMENT AND MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail later. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy related products, and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energys subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of capacity, energy and energy related instruments. These marketing activities are primarily focused on specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and are generally less than one year in length. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the Companys risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy. Certain contracts and financial instruments within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended (SFAS No. 133). The fair value of the commodity trading contracts as of Dec. 31, 2005, was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Jan. 1, 2005 $ Contracts realized or settled during the year (6.1 ) Fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year 10.0 Fair value of contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2005 $ 3.9 As of Dec. 31, 2005, the fair values by source for the commodity trading and hedging net asset or liability balances were as follows: Commodity Trading Contracts Futures/Forwards (Thousands of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value NSP Minnesota 1 $ 663 $ $ $ $ 663 2 15 1,109 322 1,446 PSCo 1 1,352 1,352 2 1,382 261 1,643 Total futures/forwards fair value $ 3,412 $ 1,370 $ 322 $ $ 5,104 73 Options (Thousands of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value NSP Minnesota 2 $ (251 ) $ $ $ $ (251 ) PSCo 2 (922 ) (922 ) Total options fair value $ (1,173 ) $ $ $ $ (1,173 ) Hedge Contracts Futures/Forwards (Thousands of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value NSP Minnesota 2 $ 2,927 $ $ $ $ 2,927 PSCo 2 1,944 1,944 Total futures/forwards fair value $ 4,871 $ $ $ $ 4,871 Options (Thousands of Dollars) Source of Fair Value Maturity Less than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value NSP Minnesota 2 $ (583 ) $ $ $ $ (583 ) NSP Wisconsin 2 726 726 PSCo 2 (1,954 ) 1,036 (918 ) Total options fair value $ (1,811 ) $ 1,036 $ $ $ (775 ) 1 Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. 2 Prices based on models and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model. Normal purchases and sales transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133 and certain other long term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they are not included in the commodity trading operations and are not qualifying hedges. At Dec. 31, 2005, a 10 percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for commodity trading contracts would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.7 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.8 million. Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as Value at Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR model employs a 95 percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas. 74 As of Dec. 31, 2005, the VaRs for the commodity trading operations were: During 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Year ended Dec. 31, 2005 Average High Low Commodity trading (a) $ 2.06 $ 1.44 $ 4.43 $ 0.26 (a) Comprises transactions for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. As of Dec. 31, 2004, the VaRs for the commodity trading operations were: During 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Year ended Dec. 31, 2004 Average High Low Commodity trading (a) $ 0.29 $ 0.97 $ 2.09 $ 0.27 (a) Comprises transactions for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. Xcel Energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. Reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from Other Comprehensive Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt instrument, and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability or firm commitment. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair values of related hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. To test the effectiveness of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty valuations, internal valuations and broker quotes. There have been no material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate swaps during the periods presented. At Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $10.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to fund certain costs of nuclear decommissioning, which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. As of Dec. 31, 2005 and 2004, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities. Per NRC mandates, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk In addition to the risks discussed previously, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. At Dec. 31, 2005, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of $44.2 million, while a decrease of 10 percent would have resulted in a decrease of $41.1 million. 75 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by (used in) operating activities Continuing operations $ 1,131 $ 1,128 $ 1,106 Discontinued operations 53 (315 ) 275 Total $ 1,184 $ 813 $ 1,381 Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations was basically unchanged for 2005 and 2004. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations increased $368 million during 2005 compared with 2004. During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by tax benefits received. Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations increased $22 million during 2004 compared with 2003 due to the timing of payments made for trade payables partially offset by increased inventory costs related to higher natural gas costs, which will be collected from customers in future periods. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased $590 million during 2004 compared with 2003. During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by tax benefits received. (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities Continuing operations $ (1,362 ) $ (1,268 ) $ (1,055 ) Discontinued operations 136 37 126 Total $ (1,226 ) $ (1,231 ) $ (929 ) Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $94 million during 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to increased 2005 utility capital expenditures and restricted cash released in 2004. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations increased $99 million during 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Cheyenne and Seren in 2005. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $213 million during 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations decreased $89 million during 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Viking in 2003. (Millions of Dollars) 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Continuing operations $ 111 $ (111 ) $ (346 ) Discontinued operations (21 ) Total $ 111 $ (111 ) $ (367 ) Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased $222 million during 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short term borrowings. Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased $235 million during 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to increased short term borrowings partially offset by a common stock repurchase. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources. 76 Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures, Nonregulated Investments and Long Term Debt Obligations The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 are shown in the table below. (Millions of Dollars) 2006 2007 2008 Electric utility $ 1,386 $ 1,381 $ 1,169 Natural gas utility 110 113 132 Common utility 84 81 81 Total utility 1,580 1,575 1,382 Other nonregulated 2 Total capital expenditures 1,580 1,575 1,384 Debt maturities 835 339 632 Total capital requirements $ 2,415 $ 1,914 $ 2,016 The capital expenditure forecast includes PSCos share of the 750 megawatt Comanche 3 coal fired plant in Colorado and the MERP project, which will reduce the emissions of three of NSP Minnesotas generating plants. The MERP project is expected to cost approximately $1 billion, with major construction starting in 2005 and finishing in 2009. Xcel Energy began recovering the costs of the emission reduction project through customer rate increases effective Jan. 1, 2006. Comanche 3 is expected to cost approximately $1.35 billion, with major construction starting in 2006 and finishing in 2010. The CPUC has approved sharing one third ownership of this plant with other parties. Consequently, Xcel Energys capital expenditure forecast includes $1 billion, approximately two thirds of the total cost. The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energys long term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energys ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future requirements to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2005. See additional discussion in the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Notes 3, 4, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period (Thousands of Dollars) Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt, principal and interest payments $ 10,387,694 $ 1,236,074 $ 1,672,323 $ 2,148,700 $ 5,330,597 Capital lease obligations 98,684 6,447 12,426 11,794 68,017 Operating leases (a) 208,249 41,376 64,589 48,055 54,229 Unconditional purchase obligations (b) 11,972,606 2,573,587 2,639,833 2,057,622 4,701,564 Other long term obligations 265,925 38,213 55,376 52,706 119,630 Payments to vendors in process 129,315 129,315 Short term debt 746,120 746,120 Total contractual cash obligations (c) $ 23,808,593 $ 4,771,132 $ 4,444,547 $ 4,318,877 $ 10,274,037 (a) Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2005, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $110.8 million. (b) Obligations to purchase fuels for electric generation plants, and electricity and natural gas for resale. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted based on indexes. However, the effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (c) Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately $600 million of goods and services through the year 2020, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures. 77 Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energys objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable the board of directors to grant annual dividend increases in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: Projected cash generation from utility operations; Projected capital investment in the utility businesses; A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and The impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Under the PUHCA, unless there was an order from the SEC, a holding company or any subsidiary could only declare and pay dividends out of retained earnings. Xcel Energy had $562 million of retained earnings at Dec. 31, 2005, and expects to declare dividends as scheduled. With the repeal of the PUHCA, this limitation on a holding companys dividends will no longer apply. Notwithstanding the repeal of the PUHCA, federal law will still limit the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from the utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent. Some utility subsidiaries must comply with bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios. The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energys capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, i.e., not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus, divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energys capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2005, was 84 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energys ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than 25 percent or will be reduced to less than 25 percent through dividends (other than dividends payable in common stock), distributions or acquisitions of Xcel Energy common stock. Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Registered holding companies and certain of their subsidiaries, including Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries, were limited under PUHCA in their ability to issue securities. Registered holding companies and their subsidiaries could not issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the SEC. Because Xcel Energy did not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules, it had received financing authority from the SEC under the PUHCA for various financing arrangements. Xcel Energys current financing authority permits it, subject to certain conditions, to issue through June 30, 2008, up to $1.8 billion of new long term debt, common equity and equity linked securities, and $1.0 billion of short term debt securities during the new authorization period, provided that the aggregate amount of long term debt, common equity, and equity linked and short term debt securities issued during the new authorization period does not exceed $2.0 billion. 78 Xcel Energys ability to issue securities under the financing authority was subject to a number of conditions. One of the conditions of the financing authority was that Xcel Energys consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at least 30 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2005, the common equity ratio was approximately 42 percent. Additional conditions require that a security to be issued, must be at least rated investment grade by one nationally recognized rating agency. Finally, all outstanding securities that are rated must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. On Feb. 10, 2006, Xcel Energys senior unsecured debt was considered investment grade by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (Standard & Poors), Moodys and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Upon the repeal of the PUHCA, these limitations on Xcel Energys financings generally will no longer apply, nor will the PUHCA restrictions generally apply to the financings by the utility subsidiaries. However, utility financings and intra system financing will become subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC has granted a blanket authorization for certain intra system financings involving holding companies. Requests to the FERC to clarify its rules or grant similar blanket authorizations are presently pending before the FERC. Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries are presently evaluating the specific applications that they will need to file with FERC due to repeal of the PUHCA. It is possible that in lieu of requesting authority from the FERC for intra system financings, Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries may rely in the interim on a transitional savings clause that would permit such financing transactions to the extent authorized by the SEC financing order and so long as the conditions in the SEC financing order continue to be satisfied. Short Term Funding Sources Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures and working capital. Another significant short term funding need is the dividend payment. As of Feb. 14, 2006, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: Facility Drawn* Available Cash Liquidity Maturity (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota $ 450 $ 162.7 $ 287.3 $ $ 287.3 April 2010 NSP Wisconsin PSCo 600 212.0 388.0 49.2 437.2 April 2010 PSCo 50 50.0 50.0 April 2006 SPS 250 82.0 168.0 12.7 180.7 April 2010 Xcel Energy holding company 700 393.5 306.5 0.8 307.3 November 2009 Total $ 2,050 $ 850.2 $ 1,199.8 $ 62.7 $ 1,262.5 * Includes direct borrowings, outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit. Operating cash flow as a source of short term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather; regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental regulation compliance and industry deregulation; changes in the trends for energy prices; and supply and operational uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations Analysis. Short term borrowing as a source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energys short term borrowing arrangements, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moodys, Standard & Poors, and Fitch. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. As of Feb. 23, 2006, the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies: 79 Company Credit Type Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Xcel Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Xcel Energy Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 NSP Minnesota Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB A NSP Minnesota Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ NSP Minnesota Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F1 NSP Wisconsin Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB A NSP Wisconsin Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ PSCo Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ PSCo Senior Secured Debt A3 A A PSCo Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 SPS Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB A SPS Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 Note: Moodys highest credit rating for debt is Aaa and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3. Both Standard & Poors and Fitchs highest credit rating for debt are AAA and lowest investment grade rating is BBB . Moodys prime ratings for commercial paper range from P 1 to P 3. Standard & Poors ratings for commercial paper range from A 1 to A 3. Fitchs ratings for commercial paper range from F1 to F3. In the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings to below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit rating triggers in its debt agreements. Money Pool Xcel Energy has established a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries and received required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates. The utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to the holding company. NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the utility money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. No borrowings or loans were outstanding at Dec. 31, 2005. Borrowing limits are $250 million, $250 million and $100 million, respectively. As a consequence of the repeal of PUHCA and the recent amendments to section 203 of the Federal Power Act, it may be necessary for Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries to submit its existing money pool arrangement to FERC for its approval. Xcel Energy and the utility subsidiaries are presently evaluating the situation. Registration Statements Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had approximately 403 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2005, Xcel Energy had approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities: In February 2002, Xcel Energy filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC. Xcel Energy may issue debt securities, common stock and rights to purchase common stock under this shelf registration. Xcel Energy has approximately $482.5 million remaining under this registration. Xcel Energy has approximately $400 million remaining under the $1 billion unsecured debt shelf registration filed with the SEC in 2000. On March 22, 2005, NSP Minnesota filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC to register an additional $1 billion of secured or unsecured debt securities, which may be issued from time to time in the future. This registration became effective on April 7, 2005, and supplements the $40 million of debt securities previously registered with the SEC. After issuance of $250 million of first mortgage bonds in July 2005, as discussed later, $790 million remains available under the currently effective registration statement. PSCo has an effective shelf registration statement with the SEC under which $800 million of secured first collateral trust bonds or unsecured senior debt securities were registered. PSCo has approximately $225 million remaining under this registration. 80 Future Financing Plans Xcel Energy generally expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through internally generated funds. Xcel Energy plans to refinance existing long term debt or scheduled long term debt maturities at each of the regulated operating utilities based on prevailing market conditions. To facilitate potential long term debt issuances at the utility subsidiaries, SPS intends to file a long term debt shelf registration statement with the SEC for up to $500 million in 2006, and NSP Wisconsin may file a long term debt shelf registration for up to $100 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Xcel Energy does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
