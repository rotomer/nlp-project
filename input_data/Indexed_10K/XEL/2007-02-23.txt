Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments and Organizational Overview Continuing Operations Xcel Energy is a public utility holding company. In 2006, Xcel Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 8 states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP Minnesota; NSP Wisconsin; PSCo; and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies comprise the continuing regulated utility operations. Xcel Energys nonregulated subsidiary reported in continuing operations is Eloigne, which invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax reported credits. Discontinued Operations See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of discontinued operations. Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, objective, outlook, plan, project, possible, potential, should and similar expressions. Actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including the availability of credit and its impact on capital expenditures and the ability of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms; business conditions in the energy industry; actions of credit rating agencies; competitive factors, including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries; unusual weather; effects of geopolitical events, including war and acts of terrorism; state, federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery, have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership; structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets; costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims; actions of accounting regulatory bodies; the items described under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations; and the other risk factors listed from time to time by Xcel Energy in reports filed with the SEC, including Risk Factors in Item 1A of Xcel Energys Form 10 K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006 and Exhibit 99.01 to Xcel Energys Form 10 K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006. Managements Strategic Plan Xcel Energys strategy, called Building the Core, is to invest in the core utility businesses and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. Were a vertically integrated utility and intend to stay that way. Investments of approximately $9 billion are planned over the next five years in our core operations to grow our business in response to growing customer demand and environmental initiatives. The need for additional energy supply is expected throughout our service territory. Many of the states in which we operate are considering renewable portfolio standards, requiring incremental investment in wind generation and transmission facitlities. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing electric system reliability including making significant investments in transmission and distribution systems. These customer driven requirements create investment opportunities for us. The strategy of Building the Core has three phases. The first phase is obtaining legislative and regulatory support for large investment initiatives prior to making the investment. To avoid excessive risk for the company, it is critical to reduce regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments. We accomplished this for both the MERP in Minnesota and the Comanche 3 coal plant in Colorado. Transmission legislation has been passed in Minnesota, allowing that states regulatory commission to approve recovery for transmission investments without filing a general rate case. In Texas, the legislature authorized annual recovery for transmission infrastructure improvements. Both legislative initiatives support necessary new investment in our transmission system. 41 The second phase is making those investments. In a normal year, we spend approximately $1 billion on capital projects. In addition to a base level of capital investment, we expect to have significant investment opportunity. Among those opportunities are: approximately $1 billion through 2010 for MERP, a project to convert two aging coal fired plants to natural gas plants and to install pollution control equipment at a third coal plant; approximately $1 billion through 2010 for Comanche 3, a project to build a coal plant in Colorado; a proposed $1 billion through 2015 to extend the lives and increase the output of our two nuclear plants, Monticello and Prairie Island; a proposed $900 million investment through 2012 to add capacity and reduce emissions at our Sherco coal fired plant; a planned investment by the CapX 2020 coalition of utilities of $1.3 billion between 2008 and 2012 to expand the transmission system in the upper Midwest, of which our share of the investment would be approximately $700 million, representing the first phase of CapX 2020; and the potential of building an IGCC plant in Colorado and owning wind generation. As a result of these investments, as well as continued investments in our transmission and distribution system, we expect that our rate base, or the amount on which we earn a return, will grow annually by more than 5 percent on average. The third phase is earning a fair return on utility system investments. To this end, our regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders as well as general rate cases. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows recovery of certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing a rate case. These riders allow for timely revenue recovery and are good mechanisms to recover the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time. As an example, a rider for MERP went into effect in January 2006, allowing us to earn a return on the project while the facility is being constructed. General rate cases have been filed to increase revenue recovery in most of the states in which we operate. In 2006, several rate cases were filed as part of our regulatory strategy. These rate cases, and others planned for 2007, are some of the building blocks of our earnings growth plan. Following is the current status of these initiatives: Constructive decisions were received in the Minnesota electric rate case, Colorado natural gas rate case and Wisconsin electric and natural gas cases, which increased revenue in 2006. A constructive decision was received in the Colorado electric rate case, which will increase 2007 revenue. (see Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations for the further discussion) An electric rate case was filed in Texas and gas rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado and North Dakota were filed. We expect decisions in these cases later this year, which should increase revenue in 2007 and 2008. Later this year, we plan to file electric and gas cases in Wisconsin and will consider filing cases in other states. If successful, these cases should increase revenue and earnings in 2008. Our regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on utility investments. We believe that our commissions will provide reasonable recovery, and its important to note that our financial plans include this assumption. Recent constructive results, along with past rulings, are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and give us confidence that we are pursuing the right strategy. With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. We feel the following financial objectives are both realistic and achievable: Annual earnings per share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent; Annual dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and Senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Successful execution of our Building the Core strategic plan should allow us to achieve our financial objectives, which in turn should provide investors with an attractive total return on a low risk investment. 42 Financial Review The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All note references refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Summary of Financial Results The following table summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energys business segments on the basis of GAAP. Continuing operations consist of the following: Regulated utility subsidiaries, operating in the electric and natural gas segments; and Several nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company, where corporate financing activity occurs. Discontinued operations consist of the following: Quixx Corp., a major portion of which was sold in October 2006; Utility Engineering Corp., which was sold in April 2005; Seren, a portion of which was sold in November 2005 with the remainder sold in January 2006; Cheyenne, which was sold in January 2005; NRG, which emerged from bankruptcy and was divested in late 2003; and Xcel Energy International and e prime, which were classified as held for sale in late 2003 based on the decision to divest them. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of discontinued operations.

Included in All Other segment results in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were higher than in 2005. The increase in 2006 earnings was primarily due to stronger base electric utility margin. The higher margin reflects electric rate increases in various jurisdictions, weather adjusted retail electric sales growth and revenue associated with investments in MERP. In addition, earnings increased due to the recognition of income tax benefits. Partially offsetting these positive factors were expected increases in expenses for operations, maintenance and depreciation and lower short term wholesale margins. Earnings from continuing operations for 2005 were lower than in 2004. The 2005 results had higher operating margins, which were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, including scheduled nuclear plant outages in 2005, higher employee benefit costs, higher uncollectible receivable expense and higher depreciation expense. In addition, tax expense recorded in 2005 was higher than 2004, primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded in 2004 related to the successful resolution of various income tax audit issues. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 includes the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. This was partially offset by Serens operating losses during 2005. The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 is largely due to an after tax impairment charge of $143 million, or 34 cents per share, related to Seren. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations in 2004 is attributable in part to an after tax loss of $13 million, or 3 cents per share, associated with the disposition of Cheyenne. Contribution to earnings 2006 2005 2004 Earnings Contribution by Company NSP Minnesota 47.4 % 46.6 % 43.0 % PSCo 41.5 41.7 41.3 SPS 8.1 12.5 10.3 NSP Wisconsin 7.4 5.0 10.3 Total regulated utility contribution 104.4 105.8 104.9 Holding company and other subsidiaries (4.4 ) (5.8 ) (4.9 ) Total earnings contributions 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Weather Xcel Energys earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales, but may not reduce expenses. The impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from historical averages: Weather in 2006 increased earnings by an estimated 2 cents per share; Weather in 2005 increased earnings by an estimated 3 cents per share; and Weather in 2004 decreased earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share. Statement of Operations Analysis Continuing Operations The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Electric Utility, Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins Electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms for customers in most states, the fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect electric utility margin. Xcel Energy has two distinct forms of wholesale sales: short term wholesale and commodity trading. Short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity, and the use of financial instruments associated with the fuel required for, and energy produced from, Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading is not associated with Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Short term wholesale and commodity trading activities are considered part of the electric utility segment. 44 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of regulatory sharing of margins, if applicable. Commodity trading revenues are reported net of related costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Commodity trading costs include purchased power, transmission, broker fees and other related costs. The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short term wholesale and commodity trading activities: Base Electric Utility Short Term Wholesale Commodity Trading Consolidated Totals (Millions of Dollars) 2006 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,387 $ 201 $ $ 7,588 Fuel and purchased power (3,925 ) (178 ) (4,103 ) Commodity trading revenue 610 610 Commodity trading costs (590 ) (590 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,462 $ 23 $ 20 $ 3,505 Margin as a percentage of revenue 46.9 % 11.4 % 3.3 % 42.8 % 2005 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,038 $ 196 $ $ 7,234 Fuel and purchased power (3,802 ) (120 ) (3,922 ) Commodity trading revenue 730 730 Commodity trading costs (720 ) (720 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,236 $ 76 $ 10 $ 3,322 Margin as a percentage of revenue 46.0 % 38.8 % 1.4 % 41.7 % 2004 Electric utility revenue (excluding commodity trading) $ 5,989 $ 220 $ $ 6,209 Fuel and purchased power (2,916 ) (125 ) (3,041 ) Commodity trading revenue 610 610 Commodity trading costs (594 ) (594 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,073 $ 95 $ 16 $ 3,184 Margin as a percentage of revenue 51.3 % 43.2 % 2.6 % 46.7 % The following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Base Electric Utility Revenue 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota electric rate changes $ 129 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 61 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 45 NSP Wisconsin rate case 41 MERP rider 38 Conservation and non fuel riders 24 Quality of service obligations 12 SPS Texas surcharge decision (8 ) SPS FERC 206 rate refund accrual (8 ) Other 15 Total base electric utility revenue increase $ 349 45 2006 Comparison with 2005 Base electric utility revenues increased due to rate increases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, higher fuel and purchased power costs, largely recoverable from customers, weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent, and the implementation of the MERP rider to recover financing and other costs related the MERP construction projects. 2005 vs. 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Fuel and purchased power cost recovery $ 706 Estimated impact of weather 91 Firm wholesale 67 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 57 Texas fuel reconciliation settlement 21 Conservation and non fuel riders 16 Capacity sales 15 Quality of service obligations 7 Other 69 Total base electric utility revenue increase $ 1,049 2005 Comparison with 2004 Base electric utility revenues increased due to higher fuel and purchased power costs, which are largely recovered from customers; weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.4 percent; higher sales attributable to warmer than normal summer temperatures in 2005; higher revenues from firm wholesale customers and lower regulatory accruals related to the Texas fuel reconciliation settlement. Base Electric Utility Margin 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota electric rate changes $ 129 NSP Wisconsin rate changes, including fuel and purchased power cost recovery 41 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 39 MERP rider 38 Conservation and non fuel rider revenue 24 Firm wholesale 12 Quality of service obligations 12 Transmission fee classification change (26 ) PSCo ECA incentive (20 ) SPS Texas surcharge decision (8 ) SPS FERC 206 rate refund accrual (8 ) Estimated impact of weather (3 ) Other, including certain regulatory reserves (4 ) Total base electric utility margin increase $ 226 2006 Comparison to 2005 Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased due to rate increases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, weather normalized retail sales growth, the implementation of the MERP rider, and higher firm wholesale margins. Partially offsetting the increase, is a transmission fee classification change from other operating and maintenance expenses utility in 2005 to electric utility margin in 2006, which did not impact operating income or net income. The change resulted from an analysis conducted in conjunction with the expiration and renegotiation of certain transmission agreements, resulting in better alignment of reporting such costs consistent with MISO classification. In addition, the ECA incentive earned in Colorado in 2006 resulted in a loss, as compared to a gain in 2005. 46 Base Electric Utility Margin 2005 vs. 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Estimated impact of weather $ 75 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 42 Firm wholesale 23 Texas fuel reconciliation settlement 21 Conservation and non fuel revenue 16 Quality of service obligations 7 Under recovery of fuel costs (NSP Wisconsin) (15 ) Under recovery and timing of recovery of fuel costs (other jurisdictions) (14 ) Pricing and other 8 Total base electric utility margin increase $ 163 2005 Comparison to 2004 Base electric utility margin increased due to the impact of weather, weather normalized sales growth, higher firm wholesale margins, higher conservation and non fuel rider revenues and lower accruals related to the fuel reconciliation proceedings in Texas, partially offset by higher amortization expense and lower regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in Colorado. These increases were partially offset by higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin 2006 Comparison to 2005 As expected, short term wholesale and commodity trading margins declined by $43 million for 2006 compared with 2005, due to retail sales growth, which reduced surplus generation available for sale in the wholesale market, reductions in the availability of the coal fired King plant due to the MERP project, decreased opportunities to sell due to the MISO centralized dispatch market, and the Minnesota rate case settlement agreement to refund to customers the majority of short term wholesale margins attributable to Minnesota jurisdiction customers starting in 2006. 2005 Comparison to 2004 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased $25 million for 2005 compared with 2004. The higher 2004 results reflect the impact of more favorable market conditions and higher levels of surplus generation available to sell. In addition, a preexisting contract contributed $17 million of margin in the first quarter of 2004 and expired at that time. Natural Gas Utility Revenue and Margins The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. See further discussion under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations. 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Natural gas utility revenue $ 2,156 $ 2,307 $ 1,916 Cost of natural gas purchased and transported (1,645 ) (1,823 ) (1,446 ) Natural gas utility margin $ 511 $ 484 $ 470 The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas revenue and margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Natural Gas Revenue 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Base rate changes $ 32 $ 6 Purchased natural gas cost recovery (147 ) 397 Estimated impact of weather (33 ) (5 ) Sales decline (excluding weather impact) (8 ) Transportation and other 5 (7 ) Total natural gas revenue (decrease) increase $ (151 ) $ 391 47 2006 Comparison to 2005 Natural gas revenue decreased primarily due to lower natural gas costs in 2006, which are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales declined when compared to 2005, largely due to declining use per customer. 2005 Comparison to 2004 Natural gas revenue increased primarily due to higher natural gas costs in 2005, which are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales were flat when compared to 2004, largely due to the rising cost of natural gas and its impact on customer usage. Natural Gas Margin 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Base rate changes all jurisdictions $ 32 $ 6 Transportation 8 6 Sales (decline) growth, excluding weather impact (7 ) 1 Estimated impact of weather (4 ) (2 ) Other (2 ) 3 Total natural gas margin increase $ 27 $ 14 2006 Comparison to 2005 Natural gas margins increased in 2006 due to rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Base rate changes include a full year of new rates for Minnesota in 2006 as compared to two months of increase in 2005. 2005 Comparison to 2004 Natural gas margin increased in 2005 due to rate changes in Minnesota and North Dakota, and higher transportation margins, partially offset by the impact of warmer winter temperatures in 2005 compared with 2004. Non Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items Other Utility Operating and Maintenance Expenses 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Transmission fees classification change $ (26 ) Private Fuel Storage regulatory asset (17 ) Gains on sale or disposal of assets, net (9 ) Lower nuclear plant outage costs (4 ) Higher employee benefit costs, primarily performance based 38 Higher combustion/hydro plant costs 24 Higher nuclear plant operating costs 22 Higher uncollectible receivable costs 15 Higher consulting costs 8 Higher conservation incentive program costs 4 Other, including fleet transportation and facilities costs 9 Total utility operating and maintenance expense increase $ 64 2006 Comparison to 2005 Other utility operating and maintenance expenses for 2006 increased $64 million, or 3.8 percent, compared with 2005. Higher employee benefit costs, which are primarily performance based, higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs were offset by lower nuclear plant outage costs, the transmission reclassification, gains on sale of assets, and the establishment of the Private Fuel Storage regulatory asset, based on a regulatory decision. 2005 vs. 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Lower plant related costs $ (7 ) Lower information technology costs (6 ) Higher employee benefit costs 31 Higher nuclear plant outage costs 26 Higher uncollectible receivable costs 19 Higher electric service reliability costs 9 Higher donations to energy assistant programs 4 Higher costs related to customer billing system conversion 4 Higher mutual aid assistance costs 1 Other 6 Total utility operating and maintenance expense increase $ 87 48 2005 Comparison to 2004 Other utility operating and maintenance expenses for 2005 increased by approximately $87 million, or 5.5 percent, compared with 2004. An outage at the Monticello nuclear plant and higher outage costs at Prairie Island in 2005 increased costs by approximately $26 million. Employee benefit costs were higher in 2005, primarily due to increased pension benefits and long term disability costs. Also contributing to the increase was higher uncollectible receivable costs, attributable in part, to modifications to the bankruptcy laws, higher fuel prices and certain changes in the credit and collection process. Other Nonregulated Operating and Maintenance Expenses Other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased $16 million, or 35.4 percent, in 2005 compared with 2004, primarily due to the accrual of $18 million in 2004 for a settlement agreement related to shareholder lawsuits. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $55 million, or 7.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005. Decommissioning accruals increased $20 million in 2006. Normal plant additions accounted for the remaining increase in depreciation expense for 2006 over 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense for 2005 increased by approximately $61 million, or 8.7 percent, compared with 2004. The changes were primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at Unit 1 of the Prairie Island nuclear plant and software system additions, both of which have relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions. The Prairie Island steam generators are being depreciated over the remaining life of the plant operating license, which expires in 2013. In addition, the Minnesota Renewable Development Fund and renewable cost recovery amortization, which is recovered in revenue as a non fuel rider and does not have an impact on net income, increased over 2004. The increase was partially offset by the changes in useful lives and net salvage rates approved by the MPUC in August 2005. AFDC AFDC increased in total by approximately $14 million for 2006 when compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to large capital projects beginning in 2005 and 2006, including MERP and Comanche 3, with long construction periods. The increase was partially offset by the current recovery from customers of the financing costs related to MERP through a MERP rider resulting in a lower recognition of AFDC. AFDC decreased by approximately $15 million in 2005, compared with 2004, due to generally lower AFDC rates and construction work in progress balances. Interest and Other Income (Expense) Net Interest and other income (expense) net increased $3 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase is due primarily to higher interest income on temporary cash investments, and the deferred fuel assets in Texas. Interest and other income (expense) net decreased $8 million in 2005 compared with 2004. The decrease is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior period IRS audits of $11 million in 2004, partially offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of water rights in 2005. Interest and Financing Costs Interest charges increased by approximately $24 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005. The increase is due to higher levels of both short term and long term debt and higher short term interest rates. The 2005 interest charges and financing costs increased approximately $8 million, or 1.9 percent, when compared with 2004, primarily due to increased short term borrowing levels. Income Tax Expense Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $8 million for 2006, compared with 2005. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.2 percent for 2006, compared with 25.8 percent for 2005. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by $30 million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized capital loss carryforwards. Without these tax benefits the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 28.2 percent. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 25.8 percent for 2005, compared with 23.7 percent in 2004. Income taxes recorded in 2005 reflect tax benefits of $10 million, primarily from increased research credits and a net operating loss carry back. Excluding the tax benefits, the effective rate for 2005 would have been 27.3 percent. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Holding Company and Other Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses and holding company results: Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Eloigne $ 4.6 $ 6.2 $ 8.5 Financing costs holding company (66.1 ) (52.7 ) (44.7 ) Holding company, taxes and other results 24.2 6.2 Total holding company and other loss continuing operations $ (37.3 ) $ (40.3 ) $ (36.2 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings per share 2006 2005 2004 Eloigne $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.02 Financing costs and preferred dividends holding company (0.12 ) (0.09 ) (0.08 ) Holding company, taxes and other results 0.05 0.01 Total holding company and other loss per share continuing operations $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends Holding company and other results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. The earnings per share impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2006, 2005 and 2004 included above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the dilutive securities, if converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately $15 million in 2006; $14 million in 2005; and $15 million in 2004.

Consequently, Xcel Energy reported Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued in December 2004. In 2006, the Cheyenne basis study was updated resulting in the recognition of $2.3 million in tax benefits. This plus other Cheyenne related tax benefits totaled $3.3 million or 1 cent per share. Other and Nonregulated Results Discontinued Operations In April 2005, Zachry Group, Inc. (Zachry) acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE, a nonregulated subsidiary. The majority of Quixx Corp., including Borger Energy Associates and Quixx Power Services, Inc., was sold in October 2006 to affiliates of Energy Investors Funds. In November 2005, Xcel Energy sold Serens California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC. In January 2006, Xcel Energy sold Serens Minnesota assets to Charter Communications. During 2004, Xcel Energy completed the sales of the Argentina subsidiaries of Xcel Energy International and e prime ceased conducting business. 2005 Nonregulated Results Compared with 2004 Results of discontinued nonregulated operations in 2005 include the impact of a $5 million reduction to the original asset impairment for Seren and the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. In 2004, the NRG tax basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by $13 million. Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG Xcel Energy has recognized tax benefits related to the divestiture of NRG of approximately $1.1 billion. Since these tax benefits are related to Xcel Energys investment in discontinued NRG operations, they are reported as discontinued operations. Based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize approximately $1.1 billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years. Xcel Energy used $404 million of these tax benefits through 2005, an additional $223 million in 2006, and expects to use approximately $123 million in 2007. The remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years. Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energys ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates. Sales Growth In addition to the impact of weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energys utility businesses can vary with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and other factors. Weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was 1.8 percent in 2006, and 1.4 percent in 2005. Weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was approximately (2.8) percent in 2006, and 0.2 percent in 2005. Weather normalized sales for 2007 are projected to grow between 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent for retail electric utility customers and a sales decline of 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent for retail natural gas utility customers. 51 Fuel Supply and Costs Coal Deliverability Xcel Energys operating utilities have varying dependence on coal fired generation. Coal fired generation comprises between 60 percent and 85 percent of the total annual generation. Approximately 85 percent of the annual coal requirements are supplied from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Delivery of coal was hampered during early 2006 due to disruptions caused by train derailments and continuing operational problems that started during the summer of 2005 along a key rail line in Wyoming. Coal conservation was necessary at several plants during this time that included increased purchased power and increasing the use of natural gas for electric generation. However, coal inventory improved significantly during the latter part of 2006, due in large part to rail transportation improvements. In addition, Xcel Energy acquired higher capacity railcars that facilitated inventory rebuilding. For 2007, inventory sustainability will be a critical goal, however, no mitigation efforts are expected. Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements. Pension costs have been increasing in recent years, but are expected to decrease over the next several years, due to higher than expected investment returns experienced in recent years, as well as, voluntary company contributions. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 8.75 percent in 2006 and 2005 and 9.0 percent in 2004, investment returns in 2003 and 2002 were below the assumed level of 9.25 and 9.5 percent respectively, and discount rates have declined to 5.75 percent used in 2006. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and, in 2007, expects to maintain the investment return assumption at 8.75 percent and to increase the discount rate assumption to 6.00 percent. The investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period. This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year, moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost determination process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period. Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will decrease from an expense, of $15.3 million in 2006 to an expense of $11.8 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2008. Xcel Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from Moodys. At Dec. 31, 2006, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.35 percent, and the Aaa index rate was 5.46 percent. Accordingly, Xcel Energy increased the discount rate to 6.00 percent as of Dec. 31, 2006. This rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2007 pension cost determinations. At Dec. 31, 2005, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.21 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.26 percent. The corresponding pension discount rate was 5.75 percent. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a 1 percent change would result in the following impact on the estimated pension costs recognized by Xcel Energy: A 100 basis point higher rate of return, 9.75 percent, would decrease 2007 recognized pension costs by $20.2 million; A 100 basis point lower rate of return, 7.75 percent, would increase 2007 recognized pension costs by $20.2 million; A 100 basis point higher discount rate, 7.00 percent, would decrease 2007 recognized pension costs by $4.6 million; and A 100 basis point lower discount rate, 5.00 percent, would increase 2007 recognized pension costs by $5.5 million. The Pension Protection Act changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Xcel Energy projects that no cash funding would be required for 2007 or 2008. However, the Company expects to make voluntary contributions in 2007 to maintain a level of funded status that allows for future funding flexibility and reduces cash flow volatility under the Pension Protection Act. These expected contributions are summarized in Note 9 to 52 the Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future. Regulation PUHCA 2005 The Energy Act significantly changed many federal statutes and repealed the PUHCA as of Feb. 8, 2006. However, the FERC was given authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries, authority to review service company accounting and cost allocations, and more authority over the merger and acquisition of public utilities. State commissions have similar authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries. The Energy Act is also expected to have substantial long term effects on energy markets, energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding company systems by the FERC and the DOE. The FERC and the DOE are in various stages of rulemaking in implementing the Energy Act. Customer Rate Regulation The FERC and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, conservation and demand side management efforts, and the cost of capital. In addition, the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. The most recently authorized electric utility returns are 10.54 percent for NSP Minnesota; 11.0 percent for NSP Wisconsin; 10.5 percent for PSCo; and 11.5 percent for SPS. The most recently authorized natural gas utility returns are 10.4 percent for NSP Minnesota, 11.0 percent for NSP Wisconsin and 10.5 percent for PSCo. Wholesale Energy Market Regulation In April 2005, a Day 2 wholesale energy market operated by MISO was implemented to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. MISO now centrally issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin. NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin expect to recover MISO charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital Expenditure Regulation Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC and MPUC approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants, lower emissions and increased transmission. These rate riders are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. Future Cost Recovery Regulated public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods, and to record as regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. In contrast, other companies would expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period. If restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur, Xcel Energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment, and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet. This could have a material effect on Xcel Energys results of operations in the period the write off is recorded. At Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately $1.2 billion and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.4 billion that would be recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation. In addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities, restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals. 53 Tax Matters Interest Expense Deductibility In April 2004, Xcel Energy filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to establish its right to deduct the interest expense that had accrued during tax years 1993 and 1994 on policy loans related to the COLI policies. After Xcel Energy filed this suit, the IRS sent two statutory notices of deficiency of tax, penalty and interest for 1995 through 1999. Xcel Energy has filed U.S. Tax Court petitions challenging those notices. Xcel Energy anticipates the dispute relating to its interest expense deductions will be resolved in the refund suit that is pending in the Minnesota Federal District Court and the Tax Court petitions will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the refund litigation. In the third quarter of 2006, Xcel Energy also received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS for tax years 2000 through 2002 and timely filed a Tax Court petition challenging the denial of the COLI interest expense deductions for those years. On Oct. 12, 2005, the district court denied Xcel Energys motion for summary judgment on the grounds that there were disputed issues of material fact that required a trial for resolution. At the same time, the district court denied the governments motion for summary judgment that was based on its contention that PSCo had lacked an insurable interest in the lives of the employees insured under the COLI policies. However, the district court granted Xcel Energys motion for partial summary judgment on the grounds that PSCo did have the requisite insurable interest. On May 5, 2006, Xcel Energy filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Aug. 18, 2006, the U.S. government filed a second motion for summary judgment. On Feb. 14, 2007, the Magistrate Judge issued his Report and Recommendation (R&R) to the Judge concerning both motions. In his R&R the Magistrate Judge recommends both motions be denied due to fact issues in dispute. Both parties will have an opportunity to file objections by March 5, 2007 to the Magistrate Judges recommendations. The Judge will then have broad authority to, among other things, accept or reject the recommendations in whole or in part. If both sides motions are ultimately denied, a trial is set to begin on July 24, 2007. Xcel Energy believes that the tax deduction for interest expense on the COLI policy loans is in full compliance with the tax law. Accordingly, PSRI has not recorded any provision for income tax or related interest or penalties, and has continued to take deductions for interest expense on policy loans on its income tax returns for subsequent years. The litigation could require several years to reach final resolution. Defense of Xcel Energys position may require significant cash outlays, which may or may not be recoverable in a court proceeding. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on Xcel Energys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Should the IRS ultimately prevail on this issue, tax and interest payable through Dec. 31, 2006, would reduce earnings by an estimated $421 million. Xcel Energy has received formal notification that the IRS will seek penalties. If penalties (plus associated interest) also are included, the total exposure through Dec. 31, 2006, is approximately $499 million. In addition, Xcel Energys annual earnings for 2007 would be reduced by approximately $49 million, after tax, or 11 cents per share, if COLI interest expense deductions were no longer available. COLI Dow Chemical Court Decision On Jan. 23, 2006, the 6th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an opinion in a federal income tax case involving the interest deductions for a COLI program at Dow Chemical Company. The 6th Circuit denied the tax deductions and reversed the decision of the trial court in the case. Xcel Energy has analyzed the impact of the Dow decision on its pending COLI litigation and concluded there are significant factual differences between its case and the Dow case. The courts opinion in the Dow case outlined three indicators of potential economic benefits to be examined in a COLI case and noted that the outcome of COLI cases is very fact determinative. These indicators are: Positive pre deduction cash flows; Mortality gains; and The buildup of cash values. In a split decision, the 6th Circuit found that the Dow COLI plans possessed none of these indicators of economic substance. However, in Xcel Energys COLI case, the plans were projected to have sizeable pre deduction cash flows, based upon the relevant assumptions when purchased. Moreover, the plans presented the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively. Xcel Energys COLI plans had no provision for giving back any mortality gains that it might realize. In addition, Xcel Energys plans had large cash value increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the policies. Consequently, Xcel Energy believes that the facts and circumstances of its case are stronger than Dows case and continues to believe its case has strong merits. 54 Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately: $152 million in 2006; $147 million in 2005; and $133 million in 2004. Xcel Energy expects to expense an average of approximately $176 million per year from 2007 through 2011 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain. Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $571.2 million in 2006; $327.7 million in 2005; and $57.6 million in 2004. Xcel Energy expects to incur approximately $323 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in 2007, and approximately $575 million of related expenditures from 2008 through 2011. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Approximately $213 million and $232 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of NSP Minnesotas generating plants pursuant to the MERP. Expected expenditures related to environmental modifications on Comanche Units 1 and 2 are approximately $41 million in 2007 and $26 million from 2008 through 2011. The remaining expected capital expenditures relate to various other environmental projects. In addition, NSP Minnesota has proposed a $905 million upgrade at the Sherburne County (Sherco) coal fired power plant. The project will increase capacity and reduce emissions. The MPUC is expected to rule on the project in 2008. If approved, construction would start in late 2008 and be completed in 2012. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. The EPAs CAIR impacts Xcel Energy generating facilities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Texas. The MPCA and WDNR are working on drafting rules that will require more stringent emission reductions than required by the federal program in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Currently, there is litigation concerning whether the EPA should reconsider the inclusion of West Texas in CAIR. The outcome of this litigation will impact compliance options for the Texas generating facilities. States throughout the Xcel Energy territory are implementing the federal mercury rule in various ways. In Minnesota mercury emissions from A.S. King and Sherburne County generating facilities will be regulated by the Minnesota Mercury Legislation, while the remaining Minnesota generating facilities will be regulated by the CAMR. In Colorado the Air Pollution Control Commission recently passed a mercury emissions rule. Texas implemented the EPAs CAMR. The EPA requires states to develop implementation plans to comply with the BART/Regional amendments by December 2007. The MPCA has not responded to NSP Minnesotas BART alternatives analysis submittal. In response to the BART regulations promulgated by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, PSCo submitted its BART alternatives analysis. PSCo is discussing its BART alternatives analysis with the CAPCD. The TCEQ has determined that compliance with CAIR is a substitute for BART for NOx and SO2. In January NSP Minnesota made a filing to the MPUC concerning an emissions reduction project at the Sherco generating facility. The improvement project would include generating capacity upgrades for all three units; additional SO2 emission reductions on Units 1 and 2 to improve mercury emission controls; and the installation of additional NOx controls. 55 The issue of global climate change is receiving increased attention. There is considerable debate regarding the public policy approach that the United States should follow to address the issue. Several members of Congress have also proposed legislation to regulate carbon dioxide, and several states are developing their own programs to address climate change. While it is not possible to know the eventual outcome, Xcel Energy is taking prudent steps to address the risk of potential climate regulation. Xcel Energys initiatives to prepare for potential carbon dioxide regulation include the following: Xcel Energy is participating in a voluntary carbon management program and has established goals to reduce its volume of carbon dioxide emissions by 12 million tons by 2009, and to reduce carbon intensity by 7 percent by 2012. In certain regulatory jurisdictions, Xcel Energy uses an evaluation process for future generating resources that incorporates the risk of future carbon limits through the use of a carbon cost adder or externality costs. PSCo is in the process of developing an IGCC plant that generates electricity using gasified coal and will be the first plant of its kind to capture and sequester a portion of the carbon dioxide generated by the plant. Xcel Energy is the largest retail provider of wind generated energy in the nation and continues to grow its wind portfolio. Xcel Energy is involved in initiatives to manage carbon dioxide, including the use of biosequestration and the study of geological sequestration. Xcel Energy continues to develop and expand its customer conservation and demand side management programs. Xcel Energy is working with public policy makers to support the development of a national climate policy to require the deployment of electric generation technology that emits little or no carbon dioxide. Xcel Energy believes that it is well positioned for a variety of possible outcomes. Impact of Nonregulated Investments In the past, Xcel Energys investments in nonregulated operations had a significant impact on its results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have a significant impact on its results. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders. 56 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the Xcel Energy board of directors.

For example: Probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from regulators. The ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their useful operating lives, or such other period designated by Xcel Energys regulators, is assumed. Probable outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities, including appeals and litigation where necessary, are assessed. Projections are made regarding earnings on pension investments, and the salary increases provided to employees over their periods of service. 57 The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2006. For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pending Accounting Changes FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns. FIN 48 requires that only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on its effective date. Initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Following implementation, the ongoing recognition of changes in measurement of uncertain tax positions would be reflected as a component of income tax expense. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2006. Xcel Energy has substantially completed its analysis and does not expect the cumulative effect of the adoption to be material. Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets. Fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its financial condition and results of operations and does not expect the impact of implementation to be material. Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail later. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy related products, and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists, as allowed by regulation. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energys subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of capacity, energy and energy related instruments. These marketing activities have terms of generally less than one year in length. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy. Certain contracts and financial instruments within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (SFAS No. 133). The fair value of the commodity trading contracts as of Dec. 31, 2006, was as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Jan. 1, 2006 $ 3.9 Contracts realized or settled during the year (18.4 ) Fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year 13.3 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2006 $ (1.2 ) 58 As of Dec. 31, 2006, the fair values by source for the commodity trading and hedging net asset or liability balances were as follows: Commodity Trading Contracts Futures/Forwards Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 1 $ (1,284 ) $ $ $ $ (1,284 ) 2 226 100 44 370 PSCo 1 (2,642 ) (2,642 ) 2 4,029 2,405 6,434 SPS* 1 130 130 2 350 160 61 571 Total Futures/Forwards Fair Value $ 809 $ 2,665 $ 105 $ $ 3,579 Options Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 2 $ (435 ) $ $ $ $ (435 ) PSCo 2 (4,412 ) (4,412 ) SPS* 2 93 93 Total Options Fair Value $ (4,754 ) $ $ $ $ (4,754 ) Commodity Hedge Contracts Futures/Forwards Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 1 $ (2,229 ) $ $ $ $ (2,229 ) 2 16,420 16,420 PSCo 1 (166 ) (166 ) NSP Wisconsin 1 (250 ) (250 ) Total Futures/Forwards Fair Value $ 13,775 $ $ $ $ 13,775 Options Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 2 $ 514 $ $ $ $ 514 PSCo 2 3,241 3,241 NSP Wisconsin 2 20 20 Total Options Fair Value $ 3,775 $ $ $ $ 3,775 1 Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. 2 Prices based on models and other valuation methods.

The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model. * SPS conducts an inconsequential amount of commodity trading. Margins from commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to SPS, NSP Minnesota, and PSCo, pursuant to the JOA approved by the FERC. As a result of the JOA, margins received pursuant to the JOA are reflected as part of the fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset or liability balances. Normal purchases and sales transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133 and certain other long term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they are not recorded at fair value as part of commodity trading operations and are not qualifying hedges. At Dec. 31, 2006, a 10 percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.9 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $1.1 million. 59 Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR model employs a 95 percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas. VaR is calculated on a consolidated basis. The VaRs for the commodity trading operations were: During 2006 Year ended Dec. 31, 2006 Average High Low (Millions of Dollars) Commodity trading(a) $ 0.49 $ 1.32 $ 2.60 $ 0.39 During 2005 Year ended Dec. 31, 2005 Average High Low (Millions of Dollars) Commodity trading(a) $ 2.06 $ 1.44 $ 4.43 $ 0.26 (a) Comprises transactions for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. Xcel Energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure. The fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. Reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from Other Comprehensive Income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt instrument, and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt. Hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value of debt instruments. Changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair values of debt instruments. To test the effectiveness of such swaps, a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty valuations, internal valuations and broker quotes. There have been no material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate swaps during the periods presented. At Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $7.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund costs of nuclear decommissioning. These trust funds are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. As of Dec. 31, 2006 and 2005, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities. These funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and 60 termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. At Dec. 31, 2006, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of $8.1 million, while a decrease of 10 percent would have resulted in a decrease of $7.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities Continuing operations $ 1,729 $ 1,131 $ 1,128 Discontinued operations 195 53 (315 ) Total $ 1,924 $ 1,184 $ 813 Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations increased $598 million during 2006. The increase is primarily due to the timing of working capital activity. Specifically, the collection of receivables and the collection of recoverable purchased natural gas and electric energy costs increased in 2006. The increase in cash provided by operations was partially offset by the timing of cash expenditures for accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations increased $150 million during 2006, largely due to the recognition of deferred tax assets related to NRG. Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations was basically unchanged for 2005 and 2004. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations increased $368 million during 2005 compared with 2004. During 2004, Xcel Energy paid $752 million pursuant to the NRG settlement agreement, which was partially offset by tax benefits received. 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities Continuing operations $ (1,601 ) $ (1,362 ) $ (1,268 ) Discontinued operations 51 136 37 Total $ (1,550 ) $ (1,226 ) $ (1,231 ) Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $239 million during 2006, primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of assets. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations decreased $84 million during 2006, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Cheyenne and Seren in 2005. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $94 million during 2005, primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures and restricted cash released in 2004. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations increased $99 million during 2005, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Cheyenne and Seren in 2005. 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Continuing operations $ (422 ) $ 111 $ (111 ) Total $ (422 ) $ 111 $ (111 ) Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations decreased $533 million during 2006 due to increased net repayments of short term borrowings in 2006 compared to 2005. Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased $222 million during 2005 primarily due to increased short term borrowings. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources. 61 Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures and Long Term Debt Obligations The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2007 through 2011 are shown in the tables below. By Segment 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (Millions of Dollars) Electric utility $ 1,723 $ 1,692 $ 1,466 $ 1,623 $ 1,503 Natural gas utility 117 141 165 139 121 Common utility and other 60 67 69 88 76 Total capital expenditures 1,900 1,900 1,700 1,850 1,700 Debt maturities 336 632 558 783 52 Total capital requirements $ 2,236 $ 2,532 $ 2,258 $ 2,633 $ 1,752 By Utility Subsidiary 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota $ 995 $ 1,050 $ 1,000 $ 1,090 $ 995 NSP Wisconsin 75 85 55 60 65 PSCo 690 635 515 580 490 SPS 140 130 130 120 150 Total $ 1,900 $ 1,900 $ 1,700 $ 1,850 $ 1,700 By Project 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 (Millions of Dollars) Base and other capital expenditures $ 955 $ 950 $ 950 $ 1,000 $ 965 MERP 275 170 35 10 Comanche 3 345 275 55 15 Minnesota wind transmission 150 20 50 15 Minnesota wind generation 50 155 CapX 2020 transmission 5 20 110 240 180 BART projects 5 40 65 40 Sherco capacity increases 10 65 200 245 165 Nuclear fuel 90 160 145 105 165 Nuclear capacity increases and life extension 20 80 115 155 185 Total $ 1,900 $ 1,900 $ 1,700 $ 1,850 $ 1,700 Many of the states in which Xcel Energy has operations are considering renewable portfolio standards, which would require significant increases in investment in renewable generation and transmission. Xcel Energy would generally be able to meet these standards by either purchasing renewable power from an independent party or by owning the assets. Therefore, these standards may present Xcel Energy with the opportunity to increase its investment in wind generation and transmission assets. As a result, Xcel Energys capital expenditure forecast, as detailed above, may increase due to the potential increased investments for wind generation, IGCC and transmission assets. The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions and approvals, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energys long term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energys ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future environmental requirements and renewable portfolio standards to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements. 62 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2006. See additional discussion in the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Notes 3, 4, and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years After 5 Years (Thousands of Dollars) Long term debt, principal and interest payments $ 11,883,096 $ 759,539 $ 1,943,750 $ 1,451,972 $ 7,727,835 Capital lease obligations 92,237 6,286 12,123 11,463 62,365 Operating leases(a) 811,899 57,405 106,693 101,485 546,316 Unconditional purchase obligations(b) 13,533,315 2,239,536 3,224,813 2,491,245 5,577,721 Other long term obligations WYCO investment 145,000 47,000 98,000 Other long term obligations 202,045 25,388 47,579 46,116 82,962 Payments to vendors in process 113,183 113,183 Short term debt 626,300 626,300 Total contractual cash obligations(c) $ 27,407,075 $ 3,874,637 $ 5,432,958 $ 4,102,281 $ 13,997,199 (a) Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2006, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $186.1 million. In addition, at the end of the equipment leases terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value or equipment sold to a third party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the unamortized value. (b) Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted based on indices. However, the effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (c) Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately $1.3 billion of goods and services through the year 2021, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures. Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energys objective is to increase the annual dividend in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: Projected cash generation from utility operations; Projected capital investment in the utility businesses; A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and The impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from its utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent. Some utility subsidiaries must comply with bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios. The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energys capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus, divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energys capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2006, was 81 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energys ability to pay dividends. 63 Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock, preferred securities and hybrid securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Short Term Funding Sources Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures and working capital. Another significant short term funding need is the dividend payment. As of Feb. 20, 2007, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: Facility Drawn* Available Cash Liquidity Maturity (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota $ 500 $ 178.5 $ 321.5 $ 1.1 $ 322.6 December 2011 PSCo 700 237.0 463.0 1.3 464.3 December 2011 SPS 250 37.7 212.3 1.1 213.4 December 2011 Xcel Energy holding company 800 133.7 666.3 2.1 668.4 December 2011 Total $ 2,250 $ 586.9 $ 1,663.1 $ 5.6 $ 1,668.7 * Includes outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit. Operating cash flow as a source of short term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather; regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental regulation compliance; changes in the trends for energy prices; and supply and operational uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations Analysis. Short term borrowing as a source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energys short term borrowing arrangements, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moodys, Standard & Poors, and Fitch. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. As of Feb. 20, 2007, the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies: Company Credit Type Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Xcel Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Xcel Energy Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 NSP Minnesota Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB A NSP Minnesota Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ NSP Minnesota Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F1 NSP Wisconsin Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB A NSP Wisconsin Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ PSCo Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ PSCo Senior Secured Debt A3 A A PSCo Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 SPS Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB A SPS Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 Note: Moodys highest credit rating for debt is Aaa and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3. Both Standard & Poors and Fitchs highest credit rating for debt are AAA and lowest investment grade rating is BBB . Moodys prime ratings for commercial paper range from P 1 to P 3. Standard & Poors ratings for commercial paper range from A 1 to A 3. Fitchs ratings for commercial paper range from F1 to F3. In the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings to below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit credit rating requirements in its debt agreements. Money Pool Xcel Energy received SEC and the FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates. 64 The utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to the holding company. NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. Borrowing limits are $250 million, $250 million and $100 million, respectively. No borrowings or loans were outstanding at Dec. 31, 2006. Registration Statements Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy had approximately 407 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energys Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2006, Xcel Energy had approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities: Xcel Energy has $700 million available under its currently effective registration statement. NSP Minnesota has $390 million available under its currently effective registration statement. PSCo has approximately $225 million available under its currently effective registration statement. Future Financing Plans To facilitate potential long term debt issuances at the utility subsidiaries, PSCo intends to file a long term debt shelf registration statement with the SEC in 2007, and NSP Wisconsin may file a long term debt shelf registration for up to $125 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Xcel Energy does not have any off balance sheet arrangements, other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Earnings Guidance Xcel Energys 2007 earnings per share from continuing operations guidance and key assumptions are detailed in the following table. 2007 Diluted Earnings Per Share Range Utility operations $ 1.39 $1.499 COLI tax benefit 0.11 Holding company financing costs and other (0.15 ) Xcel Energy Continuing Operations $ 1.35 $1.455 Key Assumptions for 2007: Normal weather patterns are experienced during the year; Reasonable rate recovery is approved in the SPS Texas electric rate case; No material incremental accruals related to the SPS regulatory proceedings; Reasonable rate recovery in the Minnesota and Colorado natural gas rate cases; Weather adjusted retail electric utility sales grow by approximately 1.7 percent to 2.2 percent; Weather adjusted retail natural gas utility sales decline by approximately 1.0 percent to 2.0 percent; Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins are within a range of $15 million to $25 million; Capacity costs at NSP Minnesota and SPS are projected to increase approximately $35 million.
