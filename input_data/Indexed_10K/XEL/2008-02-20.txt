Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Business Segments and Organizational Overview  Continuing Operations Xcel Energy is a public utility holding company. In 2007, Xcel Energy continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in 8 states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP Minnesota; NSP Wisconsin; PSCo; and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline, these companies comprise the continuing regulated utility operations. Xcel Energys nonregulated subsidiary reported in continuing operations is Eloigne, which invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax credits.  Discontinued Operations See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of discontinued operations.

Managements Strategic Plan Xcel Energys strategy, called Building the Core, has three primary focuses: environmental leadership, achieving financial objectives and optimizing the management of a portfolios of operating utilities. In summary, our objective is to embrace growing customer demand and environmental initiatives by investing in our core utility businesses and earning a reasonable return on our invested capital. Below is a detailed discussion of our three primary focuses and how they support our overall Building the Core strategy. Xcel Energys Environmental Leadership Xcel Energy has adopted environmental leadership as a primary focus, forming the cornerstone of all our strategic initiatives. Xcel Energy believes that our environmental leadership meets customer and policy maker expectations and, in turn, creates significant shareholder value. As a portfolio of regulated utilities, Xcel Energy has an obligation to serve its customers by providing them with reasonably priced, reliable electric and gas services. However, Xcel Energys strategy goes beyond this traditional mission. Under the environmental leadership strategy, Xcel Energy assesses and takes prudent, balanced steps to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment while promoting technological and public policy advancements that will encourage a cleaner electric system. In light of the capital intensive nature of our business, including the long life of 46 Xcel Energys capital investments, Xcel Energy assesses and takes prudent steps to reduce the overall risk associated with potential new environmental mandates. Finally, Xcel Energy seeks to reduce regulatory uncertainty through favorable cost recovery for environmental initiatives provided by public policy makers, including legislatures and public utilities commissions. The foundation for Xcel Energys environmental leadership strategy resides with its environmental policy. Under this policy, the Xcel Energy Board of Directors, acting through the Nuclear, Environmental and Safety Committee, oversees Xcel Energys environmental compliance program and policy initiatives. The policy is available on our website at www.xcelenergy.com. Xcel Energy has created an environmental management system that provides employees with training and documentation of Xcel Energys compliance responsibilities, creates processes designed to minimize the risk of noncompliance and audits Xcel Energys environmental performance. Environmental performance is incorporated into officer and employee job responsibilities and compensation. Xcel Energy pursues environmental leadership through management of environmental policy initiatives. Xcel Energy actively evaluates public policy proposals and promotes environmental initiatives that are designed to create shareholder value, reduce financial risk and provide growth opportunities. These initiatives include the following: Xcel Energy has implemented voluntary emission reduction programs in Minnesota and Colorado. These programs have resulted or will result in substantial emission reductions from existing facilities. They also incorporate enhanced cost recovery mechanisms that provide shareholders with favorable returns for the associated emission reduction investments. Xcel Energy is the nations largest utility wind energy provider. Xcel Energy is pursuing new wind, solar and other renewable energy acquisitions and investments to meet some of the nations most aggressive renewable energy standards in the states in which Xcel Energy operates. Xcel Energy has worked with state policy makers to design these standards to incorporate favorable cost recovery mechanisms and investment opportunities. Xcel Energy is a leader in promoting new, clean energy technologies. Xcel Energy has undertaken small scale projects to study the technical and economic aspects of energy storage and the use of hydrogen. Xcel Energy is a leader in supporting the advancement of solar energy technology. Xcel Energy is also exploring the use of clean coal and is evaluating whether and how to best take advantage of state and federal incentives for clean coal development. Xcel Energy has a number of environmental initiatives focused on our customers. In Colorado, Xcel Energy has the largest customer driven wind program in the nation (WindSource) and a growing customer sited solar program, known as "Solar*Rewards." Xcel Energy also has an increasing portfolio of customer energy efficiency and conservation programs and is working with state commissions to enhance the financial incentives associated with our programs. Xcel Energy is also working to apply intelligence to its electric grid (creating a "SmartGrid") to provide customers with more choice, reliability and control over their energy use. While Xcel Energy is not currently subject to state or federal regulation of its GHG emissions, as one of the nations largest electric generating companies, Xcel Energy is committed to addressing climate change through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions. Xcel Energys current electric generating portfolio includes coal and gas fired plants that are projected to emit approximately 67 million tons of CO2 in 2007. Purchased generation is expected to emit approximately 18 million tons of CO2 in 2007. There has been a combined cumulative reduction of over 18.5 million tons of CO2 since 2003. Xcel Energy is implementing aggressive future resource development and conservation plans that will further reduce the companys CO2 emissions, both in absolute terms and per Kwh of electricity produced. See Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. In 2007, Xcel Energy filed resource plans in Minnesota and Colorado that propose significant new clean energy resources. If the state commissions approve these plans, Xcel Energy would: Increase overall system wind capacity from approximately 2,800 MW by the end of 2007 to approximately 6,000 MW by 2020; Add 225 MW of concentrating solar thermal technology; Reduce retail demand through energy efficiency and conservation programs by 1.1 percent in Minnesota and 0.7 percent in Colorado; Retire and replace approximately 230 MW of coal fired electric generation; 47 Improve the efficiency of and reduce CO2, mercury, SO2 and NOx emissions at several existing fossil plants; and Upgrade the efficiency and capacity of existing nuclear facilities. Xcel Energy has designed these plans so that, depending on fuel, commodity and other assumptions, Xcel Energy would maintain a reasonably priced product and continue to provide reliable power to our customers. At the same time, if approved, the plans would result in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The proposed Minnesota plan would reduce NSP Minnesotas CO2 emissions by 22 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. The proposed Colorado plan would reduce PSCos CO2 emissions by 10 percent below 2005 levels by 2017 and position PSCo to propose additional reductions to achieve a 20 percent reduction by 2020. Our environmental leadership strategy has resulted in numerous environmental awards and recognition. For example, Xcel Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for 2007 2008, the second consecutive year that Xcel Energy has earned this distinction. Xcel Energy strives to provide the public with detailed information regarding environmental performance and risk. Among other things, our utility companies operating in Minnesota, Colorado, and New Mexico use a carbon proxy cost mandated by the state commissions to evaluate the impact of potential future CO2 regulation on its future resource acquisition plans. Xcel Energy publishes a Triple Bottom Line Report annually, which is available on our website, www.xcelenergy.com. The Triple Bottom Line report discloses Xcel Energys environmental, economic and social performance. Xcel Energy also provides detailed information to environmental research organizations, such as Trucost, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the Climate Registry. Achieving Financial Objectives Xcel Energys financial objectives of Building the Core also has three phases: obtaining legislative and regulatory support for large investment initiatives, investing in the utility business and earning a fair return on utility system investments. The first phase, as noted above, is obtaining legislative and regulatory support for large investment initiatives, prior to making the investment. To avoid excessive risk to Xcel Energy, it is critical that Xcel Energy reduce regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments. Xcel Energy has accomplished this for both the MERP in Minnesota and the Comanche 3 coal unit in Colorado. Transmission legislation has been passed in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas and several other jurisdictions where Xcel Energy operates. The second phase is investing in the utility business. In addition to Xcel Energys normal level of capital investment, Xcel Energy expects to have significant investment opportunity, in part attributable to the environmental strategy described above. Those opportunities include the following: Approximately $1 billion through 2010 for MERP, a project to convert an aging coal fired plant to a natural gas plant and to install pollution control at another plant. During 2007, the initial phase of this project was completed with the successful conversion of the Allen S. King plant to a natural gas facility; Approximately $1 billion through 2010 for Comanche 3, a project to build an additional coal unit in Colorado; Approximately $215 million for the planned addition of two gas fired units totaling 300 MW at the Fort St. Vrain generating facility located in Colorado; A proposed $1 billion investment through 2015 to extend the lives and increase the output of two nuclear facilities, Monticello and Prairie Island; A proposed $1.1 billion investment through 2015 to add capacity and reduce emissions at the Sherco coal fired plant; A planned investment by the CapX 2020 coalition of utilities ranging from $1.3 billion to 1.6 billion between 2008 and 2015 to expand the transmission system in the upper Midwest, of which Xcel Energys share of the investment would be approximately $700 million, representing the first phase of CapX 2020; and Several other potential environmental initiatives, including substantial wind generation investment described above and outlined in the recently proposed Colorado and Minnesota resource plans. As a result of these investments, as well as continued investments in the transmission and distribution system, Xcel Energy expects that the rate base, or the amount on which Xcel Energy earns a return, will grow on average annually by more than seven percent from 2006 through 2011. 48 The third phase is earning a fair return on utility system investments. To this end, the regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders as well as general rate cases. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows recovery of certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing a rate case. These riders allow for timely revenue recovery of the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time. As an example, a rider for MERP went into effect in January 2006, allowing Xcel Energy to earn a return on the project, while each of the facilities is being constructed. Xcel Energys regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on utility investments. Xcel Energy believes that the public utility commissions will provide reasonable recovery, and it is important to note that the financial plans include this assumption. Constructive results over the last several years are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and give Xcel Energy confidence that Xcel Energy is pursuing the right strategy. These rate cases, as well others planned for 2008 and beyond, are some of the building blocks of the earnings growth plan. With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. Xcel Energy feels the following financial objectives continue to be both realistic and achievable. Annual earnings per share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent; Annual dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and Senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Successful execution of the Building the Core strategic plan should allow Xcel Energy to achieve the outlined financial objectives, which in turn should provide investors with an attractive total return on a low risk investment. Optimizing the Management of a Portfolio of Operating Utilities Optimizing the management of a portfolio of operating utilities is the third area of focus related to the Building the Core strategy. Even though Xcel Energy ultimately manages the business based on the revenue streams provided by electric and natural gas, Xcel Energy continues to evolve the management of the portfolio of utility investments. While Xcel Energy has four separate operating companies, there are certain similarities and differences that require a new approach to more effectively manage this portfolio. More specifically, Xcel Energys goal is to build on the similarities among the companies, which maximizes efficiencies from centralized management and deployment of common initiatives. Examples include market branding and environmental policy research. From an organizational perspective, examples include corporate center services as well as certain operational functions, such as asset management, environmental compliance and safety. At the same time, Xcel Energy realizes there are unique differences in each of our service territories such as local community focus and priorities, regulatory environment, physical plant infrastructure and age, weather, as well as others that require Xcel Energy to organize / align these utility specific areas to most effectively address these utility distinct characteristics. To that end, Xcel Energy has operating presidents, each located in their respective jurisdiction. The objective of this organizational structure is to optimize Xcel Energys operating efficiency while maximizing accountability.  Financial Review The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements. All note references refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements.  Summary of Financial Results The following table summarizes the earnings contributions of Xcel Energys business segments on the basis of GAAP. Continuing operations consist of the following: Regulated utility subsidiaries, operating in the electric and natural gas segments; and Other nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company, where corporate financing activity occurs. 49 Discontinued operations consist of the following: Quixx Corp., a major portion of which was sold in October 2006; Utility Engineering Corp., which was sold in April 2005; Seren, a portion of which was sold in November 2005 with the remainder sold in January 2006; Cheyenne, which was sold in January 2005; NRG, which emerged from bankruptcy and was divested in late 2003; and Xcel Energy International and e prime Inc. (e prime), which were classified as held for sale in late 2003 based on the decision to divest them. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of discontinued operations.

Included in All Other segment results in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were higher than in 2006. The increase in 2007 earnings were primarily attributed to higher electric and gas margins, reflecting various rate increases, weather normalized retail sales growth, higher rider recovery, and the impact of favorable temperatures, which also increased sales. Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher operating and maintenance expense, increased interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Earnings from continuing operations for 2006 were higher than in 2005. The increase in 2006 earnings was primarily due to stronger base electric utility margin. The higher margin reflects electric rate increases in various jurisdictions, weather adjusted retail electric sales growth and revenue associated with investments in MERP. In addition, earnings increased due to the recognition of income tax benefits. Partially offsetting these positive factors were expected increases in expenses for operations, maintenance and depreciation and lower short term wholesale margins. 50 During 2007, Xcel Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS related to a dispute associated with its COLI program. Excluding this settlement, along with the earnings associated with this insurance program, Xcel Energys ongoing 2007 earnings were $612 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with 2006 ongoing earnings of $548 million or $1.30 per share. The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings and earnings per share to ongoing earnings and earnings per share for 2007, 2006 and 2005. 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Ongoing earnings $ 612.0 $ 548.2 $ 480.4 PSRI earnings 23.4 20.5 18.7 Interest, penalties and tax related to IRS COLI settlement (59.5 ) Total continuing operations 575.9 568.7 499.1 Discontinued operations 1.4 3.1 13.9 Total GAAP earnings $ 577.3 $ 571.8 $ 513.0 2007 2006 2005 Ongoing earnings per share $ 1.43 $ 1.30 $ 1.15 PSRI earnings 0.05 0.05 0.05 Interest, penalties and tax related to IRS COLI settlement (0.13 ) Earnings per share continuing operations 1.35 1.35 1.20 Discontinued operations 0.01 0.03 Total GAAP earnings per share $ 1.35 $ 1.36 $ 1.23 As a result of the termination of the COLI program, Xcel Energys management believes that ongoing earnings provide a more meaningful comparison of earnings results between different periods in which the COLI program was in place and is more representative of Xcel Energys fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energys management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 includes the positive impact of a $17 million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of Xcel Energys divested interest in NRG. This was partially offset by Serens operating losses during 2005. Contribution to earnings 2007 2006 2005 Earnings Contribution by Company NSP Minnesota 45.9 % 47.4 % 46.6 % PSCo 51.0 41.5 41.7 SPS 5.7 8.1 12.5 NSP Wisconsin 6.5 7.4 5.0 Total regulated utility contribution 109.1 104.4 105.8 Holding company and other subsidiaries (9.1 ) (4.4 ) (5.8 ) Total earnings contributions 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Weather Xcel Energys earnings can be significantly affected by weather. Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, but also can increase expenses. Unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales, but may not reduce expenses. The impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. The following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy due to temperature variations from historical averages: Weather in 2007 increased earnings by an estimated 6 cents per share; Weather in 2006 increased earnings by an estimated 2 cents per share; and Weather in 2005 decreased earnings by an estimated 3 cents per share. 51  Statement of Operations Analysis Continuing Operations The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income.  Electric Utility, Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margins Electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and cost changes in fuel and purchased power. Due to fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms for customers in most states, the fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect electric utility margin. Xcel Energy has two distinct forms of wholesale sales: short term wholesale and commodity trading. Short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity, and the use of financial instruments associated with the fuel required for, and energy produced from, Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Commodity trading is not associated with Xcel Energys generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load. Short term wholesale and commodity trading activities are considered part of the electric utility segment. Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of regulatory sharing of margins, if applicable. Commodity trading revenues are reported net of related costs (i.e., on a margin basis) in the consolidated statements of income. Commodity trading costs include purchased power, transmission, broker fees and other related costs. The following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility, short term wholesale and commodity trading activities: Base Electric Utility Short Term Wholesale Commodity Trading Consolidated Totals (Millions of Dollars) 2007 Electric utility revenues (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,611 $ 227 $ $ 7,838 Electric fuel and purchased power utility (3,930 ) (207 ) (4,137 ) Commodity trading revenues 289 289 Commodity trading expenses (279 ) (279 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,681 $ 20 $ 10 $ 3,711 Margin as a percentage of revenues 48.4 % 8.8 % 3.5 % 45.7 % 2006 Electric utility revenues (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,387 $ 201 $ $ 7,588 Electric fuel and purchased power utility (3,925 ) (178 ) (4,103 ) Commodity trading revenues 610 610 Commodity trading expenses (590 ) (590 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,462 $ 23 $ 20 $ 3,505 Margin as a percentage of revenues 46.9 % 11.4 % 3.3 % 42.8 % 2005 Electric utility revenues (excluding commodity trading) $ 7,038 $ 196 $ $ 7,234 Electric fuel and purchased power utility (3,802 ) (120 ) (3,922 ) Commodity trading revenues 730 730 Commodity trading expenses (720 ) (720 ) Gross margin before operating expenses $ 3,236 $ 76 $ 10 $ 3,322 Margin as a percentage of revenues 46.0 % 38.8 % 1.4 % 41.7 % 52 The following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenues and base electric utility margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Base Electric Utility Revenues 2007 vs. 2006 (Millions of Dollars) PSCo electric retail rate increase $ 112 Retail sales growth (excluding weather impact) 49 Transmission revenues 32 MERP rider 29 Conservation and non fuel riders (partially offset in O&M expense) 26 Miscellaneous revenues (partially offset in O&M expense) 17 Estimated impact of weather 16 Firm wholesale 15 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery (66 ) Other (6 ) Total increase in base electric utility revenues $ 224 2007 Comparison with 2006 Base electric utility revenues increased due to a PSCo electric retail rate increase, weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.7 percent, higher transmission revenues, higher recovery from the MERP rider, which recovers financing and other costs related the MERP construction projects and higher conservation and non fuel rider recovery, mostly from the RESA and DSM riders at PSCo. Lower fuel and purchased power costs, largely recovered from customers, partially offset the positive variances. 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota electric rate changes $ 129 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 61 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 45 NSP Wisconsin rate case 41 MERP rider 38 Conservation and non fuel riders (partially offset in O&M expense) 24 Quality of service obligations 12 SPS Texas surcharge decision (8 ) SPS FERC 206 rate refund accrual (8 ) Other 15 Total increase in base electric utility revenues $ 349 2006 Comparison with 2005 Base electric utility revenues increased due to rate increases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, higher fuel and purchased power costs, largely recoverable from customers, weather normalized retail sales growth of approximately 1.8 percent, and the implementation of the MERP rider to recover financing and other costs related the MERP construction projects. Base Electric Utility Margin 2007 vs. 2006 (Millions of Dollars) PSCo electric retail rate increase $ 112 Retail sales growth (excluding weather impact) 49 MERP rider 29 Miscellaneous revenues (partially offset in O&M) 18 Estimated impact of weather 16 Transmission revenues / net of expense 15 Conservation and non fuel riders (partially offset in O&M) 13 Firm wholesale 11 SPS regulatory settlements, including fuel cost recovery 1 Purchased capacity costs (27 ) NSP Wisconsin fuel cost recovery (14 ) Other, including sales mix and other fuel recovery (4 ) Total increase in base electric utility margin $ 219 53 2007 Comparison to 2006 The increase in base electric margin for the year was due to PSCo electric rate increase, the impact of favorable temperatures and weather normalized retail sales growth. These items were partially offset by purchased power costs, NSP Wisconsin fuel cost recovery and other items. 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) NSP Minnesota electric rate changes $ 129 NSP Wisconsin rate changes, including fuel and purchased power cost recovery 41 Sales growth (excluding weather impact) 39 MERP rider 38 Conservation and non fuel rider revenues 24 Firm wholesale 12 Quality of service obligations 12 Transmission fee classification change (26 ) PSCo ECA incentive (20 ) SPS Texas surcharge decision (8 ) SPS FERC 206 rate refund accrual (8 ) Estimated impact of weather (3 ) Other, including certain regulatory reserves (4 ) Total increase in base electric utility margin $ 226 2006 Comparison to 2005 Base electric utility margins, which are primarily derived from retail customer sales, increased due to rate increases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, weather normalized retail sales growth, the implementation of the MERP rider, and higher firm wholesale margins. Partially offsetting the increase, is a transmission fee classification change from other operating and maintenance expenses utility in 2005 to electric utility margin in 2006, which did not impact operating income or net income. The change resulted from an analysis conducted in conjunction with the expiration and renegotiation of certain transmission agreements, resulting in better alignment of reporting such costs consistent with MISO classification. In addition, the ECA incentive earned in Colorado in 2006 resulted in a loss, as compared to a gain in 2005. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Margin 2007 Comparison to 2006 Short term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased approximately $13 million for 2007 compared to 2006. As expected, short term wholesale margins declined due to retail sales growth, which reduced generation available for sale in the wholesale market. 2006 Comparison to 2005 As expected, short term wholesale and commodity trading margins declined by $43 million for 2006 compared with 2005, due to retail sales growth, which reduced surplus generation available for sale in the wholesale market, reductions in the availability of the coal fired King plant due to the MERP project, decreased opportunities to sell due to the MISO centralized dispatch market and the Minnesota rate case settlement agreement to refund to customers the majority of short term wholesale margins attributable to Minnesota jurisdiction customers starting in 2006.  Natural Gas Utility Revenues and Margins The following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenues and margin. The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases. However, due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. See further discussion under Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations. 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Natural gas utility revenues $ 2,112 $ 2,156 $ 2,307 Cost of natural gas purchased and transported (1,548 ) (1,645 ) (1,823 ) Natural gas utility margin $ 564 $ 511 $ 484 54  The following summarizes the components of the changes in natural gas revenues and margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Natural Gas Revenues 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Purchased natural gas cost recovery $ (128 ) $ (147 ) Estimated impact of weather 46 (33 ) Base rate changes all jurisdictions 21 32 Transportation 6 8 Sales growth (decline) (excluding weather impact) 2 (8 ) Other, including late payment fees 9 (3 ) Total decrease in natural gas revenues $ (44 ) $ (151 ) 2007 Comparison to 2006 Natural gas revenues decreased primarily due to lower natural gas costs in 2007, which are recovered from customers. Interim rate increases were effective for Minnesota in January 2007 and base rates increased for Colorado and North Dakota customers in July 2007. 2006 Comparison to 2005 Natural gas revenues decreased primarily due to lower natural gas costs in 2006, which are recovered from customers. Retail natural gas weather normalized sales declined when compared to 2005, largely due to declining use per customer. Natural Gas Margin 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Base rate changes all jurisdictions $ 21 $ 32 Estimated impact of weather 16 (4 ) Transportation 6 8 Sales growth (decline), excluding weather impact 2 (7 ) Other 8 (2 ) Total increase in natural gas margin $ 53 $ 27 2007 Comparison to 2006 Natural gas margins increased due to interim rate increases, which were effective for Minnesota in January 2007, and base rate increases for Colorado and North Dakota customers in July 2007. 2006 Comparison to 2005 Natural gas margins increased in 2006 due to rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Base rate changes include a full year of new rates for Minnesota in 2006 as compared to two months of increase in 2005.  Non Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses 2007 vs. 2006 (Millions of Dollars) Higher combustion/hydro plant costs $ 33 Higher nuclear plant operation costs 19 Recording of private fuel storage regulatory asset in 2006 17 Higher labor costs 16 Higher conservation incentive programs (offset in electric margins) 13 Lower gains/losses on sale or disposal of assets, net 10 Higher contractor costs 10 Higher donations, including low income contributions (offset in revenues) 10 Higher material costs 5 Lower employee benefit costs (32 ) Lower nuclear plant outage costs (10 ) Lower uncollectible receivable costs (1 ) Other, including licenses and permits 6 Total increase in other operating and maintenance expenses $ 96 55 2007 Comparison to 2006 The increase in operating and maintenance expenses for 2007 was largely driven by recording a $17 million regulatory asset for private nuclear fuel storage costs which had been previously expensed and higher net gains on sales of assets in 2006. Also, higher combustion/hydro and nuclear plant costs increased operating and maintenance expense. Offsetting these increases in operating and maintenance expenses were lower performance based incentive plan expense as well as lower healthcare expense. Also partially offsetting the increased operating and maintenance expenses were lower nuclear plant outage costs, due to two refueling outages in 2006 versus only one outage in 2007. 2006 vs. 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Transmission fees classification change $ (26 ) Private Fuel Storage regulatory asset (17 ) Gains on sale or disposal of assets, net (9 ) Lower nuclear plant outage costs (4 ) Higher employee benefit costs, primarily performance based 38 Higher combustion/hydro plant costs 24 Higher nuclear plant operating costs 22 Higher uncollectible receivable costs 15 Higher consulting costs 8 Higher conservation incentive programs (offset in electric margins) 4 Other, including fleet transportation and facilities costs 11 Total increase in other operating and maintenance expenses $ 66 2006 Comparison to 2005 Other operating and maintenance expenses for 2006 increased $66 million, or 3.9 percent, compared with 2005. Higher employee benefit costs, which are primarily performance based, higher nuclear and combustion/hydro plant costs were offset by lower nuclear plant outage costs, the transmission reclassification, gains on sales of assets, and the establishment of the private fuel storage regulatory asset, based on a regulatory decision. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $5 million, or 0.6 percent, for 2007, compared to 2006. Depreciation increased due to capital additions and was largely offset by the MPUC approval of NSP Minnesotas remaining lives depreciation filing, which lengthened the life of the Monticello nuclear plant by 20 years, as well as certain other smaller plant life adjustments and adjustments to depreciable lives from the Texas rate case settlement. Both of these decisions were effective Jan. 1, 2007, and in total reduced depreciation expense by $45 million for the year. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $55 million, or 7.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005. Decommissioning accruals increased $20 million in 2006. Normal plant additions accounted for the remaining increase in depreciation expense for 2006 over 2005. AFDC AFDC increased in total by $16 million for 2007 when compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to large capital projects, including Comanche 3 and a portion of MERP, with long construction periods. AFDC increased in total by approximately $14 million for 2006 when compared to 2005. The increase was due primarily to large capital projects beginning in 2005 and 2006, including MERP and Comanche 3, with long construction periods. The increase was partially offset by the current recovery from customers of the financing costs related to MERP through a MERP rider resulting in a lower recognition of AFDC. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net increased $7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase is due primarily to higher interest income on temporary cash investments and the decrease in insurance policy interest expense related to COLI due to the settlement reached with the U.S. Government. In addition, interest and penalties related to the COLI settlement, increased by $43 million in 2007, due to the settlement reached with the U.S. Government. Interest and other income (expense) net increased $3 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase is due primarily to higher interest income on temporary cash investments, and the deferred fuel assets in Texas. Interest and Financing Costs Interest charges increased by approximately $33 million, or 6.8 percent, for 2007 compared with 2006. The increase is due to higher levels of both short term and long term debt and higher interest rates. 56 Interest charges increased by approximately $24 million, or 5.1 percent, for 2006 compared with 2005. The increase is due to higher levels of both short term and long term debt and higher short term interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $113 million for 2007, compared with 2006. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income (excluding COLI) and $16.1 million of tax expense related to the COLI settlement in 2007 and $29.9 million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized capital loss carry forwards in 2006. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 33.8 percent, compared with 24.2 percent for the same period in 2006. The higher effective tax rate for 2007 was primarily due to the COLI settlement and the lower effective tax rate for 2006 was primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit relating to the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized capital loss carry forwards. Without these charges and benefits, the effective tax rate for 2007 and 2006 would have been 30.3 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively. Income taxes for continuing operations increased by $8 million for 2006, compared with 2005. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24.2 percent for 2006, compared with 25.8 percent for 2005. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by $30 million of tax benefits from the reversal of a regulatory reserve and realized capital loss carry forwards. Without these tax benefits the effective tax rate for 2006 would have been 28.2 percent. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.  Holding Company and Other Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses and holding company results: Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Eloigne $ 2.6 $ 4.6 $ 6.2 Financing costs holding company (71.9 ) (66.1 ) (52.7 ) Holding company, taxes and other results 9.2 24.2 6.2 Total holding company and other loss continuing operations $ (60.1 ) $ (37.3 ) $ (40.3 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys earnings per share 2007 2006 2005 Eloigne $ $ 0.01 $ 0.01 Financing costs and preferred dividends holding company (0.15 ) (0.12 ) (0.09 ) Holding company, taxes and other results 0.03 0.05 0.01 Total holding company and other loss per share continuing operations $ (0.12 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends Holding company and other results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. The earnings per share impact of financing costs and preferred dividends for 2007, 2006 and 2005 included above reflects dilutive securities, as discussed further in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The impact of the dilutive securities, if converted, is a reduction of interest expense resulting in an increase in net income of approximately $10 million in 2007; $15 million in 2006; and $14 million in 2005. 57  Statement of Operations Analysis Discontinued Operations (Net of Tax) A summary of the various components of discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended Dec. 31: 2007 2006 2005 Income (loss) in millions Cheyenne $ $ 3.0 $ 0.2 Regulated utility segments income 3.0 0.2 NRG 0.4 (0.5 ) 16.1 Xcel Energy International 2.4 (0.5 ) 0.1 e prime 0.1 (0.1 ) Seren (2.9 ) 2.1 1.8 Utility Engineering Corp. / Quixx Corp. 1.3 (0.7 ) (4.4 ) Other 0.2 (0.4 ) 0.2 Nonregulated/other income 1.4 0.1 13.7 Total income from discontinued operations $ 1.4 $ 3.1 $ 13.9 Income (loss) per share Cheyenne $ $ 0.01 $ Regulated utility segments income per share 0.01 NRG 0.04 Xcel Energy International 0.01 e prime Seren (0.01 ) Utility Engineering, Corp. / Quixx Corp.

Consequently, Xcel Energy reported Cheyenne results as a component of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The sale was completed in January 2005 and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately $13 million, or 3 cents per share, which was accrued in December 2004. In 2006, the Cheyenne basis study was updated resulting in the recognition of $2.3 million in tax benefits. This plus other Cheyenne related tax benefits totaled $3.3 million or 1 cent per share.  Other and Nonregulated Results Discontinued Operations In April 2005, Zachry Group, Inc. (Zachry) acquired all of the outstanding shares of UE, a nonregulated subsidiary. The majority of Quixx Corp., including Borger Energy Associates and Quixx Power Services, Inc., was sold in October 2006 to affiliates of Energy Investors Funds. In November 2005, Xcel Energy sold Serens California assets to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC. In January 2006, Xcel Energy sold Serens Minnesota assets to Charter Communications. Tax Benefits Related to Investment in NRG Xcel Energy has recognized cumulative tax benefits related to the divestiture of NRG of approximately $1.1 billion. Since these tax benefits are related to Xcel Energys investment in discontinued NRG operations, they are reported primarily in discontinued operations. Based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities, Xcel Energy expects to realize approximately $1.1 billion of savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years due to net operating loss carryforwards. Xcel Energy used $630 million of these deferred tax benefits through 2006, an additional $90 million in 2007, and expects to use approximately $110 million in 2008. The remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years.  Factors Affecting Results of Continuing Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas 58 service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energys ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. Management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates. Sales Growth In addition to the impact of weather, customer sales levels in Xcel Energys utility businesses can vary with economic conditions, energy prices, customer usage patterns and other factors. Weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was 1.7 percent in 2007, and 1.8 percent in 2006. Weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was approximately 0.8 percent in 2007, and (2.8) percent in 2006. Weather normalized sales for 2008 are projected to grow between 1.8 percent and 2.2 percent for retail electric utility customers and 0.0 percent to 1.0 percent for retail natural gas utility customers. Fuel Supply and Costs Coal Deliverability Xcel Energys operating utilities have varying dependence on coal fired generation. Coal fired generation comprises between 54 percent and 80 percent of the total annual generation. Approximately 86 percent of the annual coal requirements are supplied from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which includes changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and post retirement benefits costs may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see "Employee Benefits" under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Regulation PUHCA 2005 The Energy Act significantly changed many federal statutes. The FERC was given authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries, authority to review service company accounting and cost allocations, and more authority over the merger and acquisition of public utilities. State commissions have similar authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries. Customer Rate Regulation The FERC and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are requested infrequently in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, conservation and DSM efforts and the cost of capital. In addition, the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. Wholesale Energy Market Regulation In 2005, a Day 2 wholesale energy market operated by MISO was implemented to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. MISO now centrally issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin. In September 2007, MISO proposed to modify the Day 2 market to establish a regional ASM effective 59 in June 2008. The ASM is intended to provide further efficiencies in generation dispatch by allowing for regional regulation response and contingency reserve services through a bid based market mechanism co optimized with the Day 2 energy market. NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin expect to recover MISO charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Capital Expenditure Regulation Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC and MPUC approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, and increased transmission. These rate riders are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented or proposed to establish formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate increases as transmission investments increase in a manner similar to the rate riders. Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused, and may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately: $173 million in 2007; $152 million in 2006; and $147 million in 2005. Xcel Energy expects to expense an average of approximately $201 million per year from 2008 through 2012 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain. Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $438.6 million in 2007; $571.2 million in 2006; and $327.7 million in 2005. Xcel Energy expects to incur approximately $455 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in 2008, and approximately $269 million of related expenditures from 2009 through 2012. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. Approximately $101 million and $14 million of these expenditures, respectively, are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of NSP Minnesotas generating plants pursuant to the MERP. Expected expenditures related to environmental modifications on Comanche Units 1 and 2 are approximately $156 million in 2008 and $38 million from 2009 through 2012. The remaining expected capital expenditures relate to various other environmental projects. In addition, NSP Minnesota has proposed a $1.1 billion upgrade at the Sherco coal fired power plant. The project will increase capacity and reduce emissions. The MPUC is expected to rule on the project in 2008. If approved, construction would start in late 2008 and be completed in 2012. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. Generating facilities throughout the Xcel Energy territory are subject to state only mercury reduction requirements. In Minnesota mercury emissions from A.S. King and Sherburne County generating facilities will be regulated by the 60 Minnesota Mercury Legislation, and in Colorado, seven units are subject to a mercury emissions rule passed by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. These facilities, as well as other generating units, were also subject to regulation under the federal CAMR; however, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated this rule on Feb. 8, 2008. The EPA requires states to develop implementation plans to comply with the BART/Regional Haze Rules by December 2007. At this time, MPCA is not requiring any BART specific controls that go beyond controls required for CAIR compliance. In response to the BART regulations promulgated by the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, PSCo submitted its BART alternatives analysis, which had been approved by the CAPCD, as well as the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission during a public hearing in December 2007. CAPCDs BART determinations and corresponding provisions of the regional haze state implementation plan will be submitted to the EPA for approval in 2008. The TCEQ has determined that compliance with CAIR is a substitute for BART for NOx and SO2. In January, NSP Minnesota made a filing to the MPUC concerning an emissions reduction project at the Sherco generating facility. The improvement project would include generating capacity upgrades for all three units; additional SO2 emission reductions on Units 1 and 2 to improve mercury emission controls; and the installation of additional NOx controls. Impact of Nonregulated Investments In the past, Xcel Energys investments in nonregulated operations had a significant impact on its results of operations. As a result of the divestiture of NRG and other nonregulated operations, Xcel Energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations to have a significant impact on its results in the future. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most critical to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Xcel Energy Board of Directors.  Regulatory Accounting Xcel Energy is a holding company with rate regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the FASB "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71). SFAS No. 71 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates could be charged and collected. Xcel Energys rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of current and future cash flows. Regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers. Regulatory liabilities represent incurred or accrued credits that have been deferred because they will be returned to customers in future rates. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets would be charged to expense and regulatory liabilities would be recorded as income. As of Dec. 31, 2007 and 2006, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current earnings. However, there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets. In addition, deregulation would be 61 a change that occurs over time, due to legal processes and procedures, which could moderate the impact to Xcel Energys consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 for additional details on regulatory assets and liabilities.  Nuclear Decommissioning NSP Minnesota owns nuclear generation facilities and regulations require NSP Minnesota to decommission its nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service. Xcel Energy records future plant removal obligations as a liability at fair value. This liability will be increased over time by applying the interest method of accretion to the liability. Due to regulation, depreciation expense is recorded to match the recovery of future cost of decommissioning, or retirement, of its nuclear generating plants. This recovery is calculated using an annuity approach designed to provide for full rate recovery of the future decommissioning costs. Amounts recorded for nuclear AROs, in excess of decommissioning expense and investment returns, both realized and unrealized, cumulatively are deferred through the establishment of a regulatory asset for future recovery pursuant to SFAS No. 71. A portion of the rates charged to customers is deposited into an external trust fund, during the facilities operating lives, in order to provide for this obligation. The fair value of external nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments are estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments. Realized investment returns from these investments and recovery to date is used by regulators when determining future decommissioning recovery. NSP Minnesota conducts periodic decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will be incurred to decommission the facilities. The costs are initially presented in amounts prior to inflation adjustments and then inflated to future periods using decommissioning specific cost inflators. Decommissioning of NSP Minnesotas nuclear facilities is planned for the period from cessation of operations through 2050 assuming the prompt dismantlement method. The following key assumptions have a significant effect on these estimates: Escalation Rate The MPUC determines the escalation rate based on various presumptions surrounded by the fact that associated costs will escalate at a certain rate over time. The most recent decommissioning study, completed in 2005, set the escalation rate at 3.61 percent. An escalation rate for the cost of disposing of nuclear fuel waste was set at 6.0 percent. Over the short term, these rates can differ from the set rates and accrual estimates can be significantly affected by small changes in assumed escalation rates. Life Extension Currently, decommissioning recovery periods end in 2020 for Monticello and in 2013 and 2014 for Prairie Islands two facilities. Changes made to decommissioning cost estimates, the escalation rate and the earnings rate can be amplified by these short end of license life periods. With the recent re licensing of Monticello and the preparation for re licensing Prairie Island, any change in license life could have a material effect on the accrual. Under FASB Statement No. 143 Accounting for AROs (SFAS No. 143), current calculations have assumed full life extension, which brings the regulatory recovery period up to 2020. These adjustments reduced the depreciation expense of NSP Minnesota by approximately $41 million for the period ended Dec.31, 2007. In addition, the lengthening of the remaining life for the Monticello nuclear plant decreased the related ARO and related regulatory asset by $121 million in the third quarter of 2007. Prairie Island anticipates filing a similar application in 2008, with final state and federal approvals expected in 2010. Cost Estimate With Spent Fuel Disposal Federal regulations require the DOE to provide a permanent repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel. NSP Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOEs permanent disposal program since 1981. The spent fuel storage assumptions have a significant influence on the decommissioning cost estimate. The manner in which spent nuclear fuel is managed and the assumptions used to develop cost estimates of decommissioning programs have a dramatic impact, which in turn can have a corresponding impact on the resulting accrual. The decommissioning calculation covers all expenses, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The total obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by a portion of the rates charged to customers, as approved by the MPUC. Decommissioning expense recoveries are based upon the same assumptions and methodologies as the fair value obligations are recorded. In addition to these assumptions discussed previously, assumptions related to future earnings of the nuclear decommissioning fund are utilized by the MPUC in determining the recovery of decommissioning costs. Through utilization of the annuity approach, an assumed rate of return on funding is calculated which provides the earnings rate. 62 With a long period of decommissioning and a funding period over the operating lives of each facility, the ability of the fund to sustain the required payments after inflation while assuring the appropriate investment structure is critical in obtaining the best benefit in the accrual. Currently, an assumption that the external funds will earn a return of 5.4 percent, after tax is utilized when setting recovery by the MPUC. Significant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned treatment of spent fuel. Materially different results could be obtained if different assumptions were utilized. Currently, our estimates of future decommissioning costs and the obligation to retire the plants have a significant impact to our financial position. The amounts recorded for AROs and regulatory assets for unrecovered costs are $1,315.1 million and $39.9 million as of December 31, 2007. If different cost estimates, shorter life assumptions or different cost escalation rates were utilized, this ARO and the unrecovered balance in regulatory assets could change materially. If future earnings on the decommissioning fund are lower than that estimated currently, future decommissioning recoveries would need to increase. The significance to our results of operations is reduced due to the fact that we record decommissioning expense based upon recovery amounts approved by our regulators. This treatment reduces the volatility of expense over time. The difference between regulatory funding (including both depreciation expense less returns from the investments fund) and amounts recorded under SFAS No. 143 are deferred as a regulatory asset.  Income Tax Accruals Judgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Effective tax rates (ETR) are also highly impacted by assumptions. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year end tax assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.) by legal entity; adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual estimates being trued up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities have been completed. In accordance with the interim reporting rules under APB 28, a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to eliminate the difference in continuing operations tax expense computed based on the actual year to date ETR and the forecasted annual ETR. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), has impacted the income tax accrual process in that the new accounting rule requires that only tax benefits that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits need to be reasonably estimated based on evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimate of range of reasonably possible changes. At any period end, and as new developments occur, management will use prudent business judgment to unrecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline. As required, Xcel Energy adopted FIN 48 as of Jan. 1, 2007 and the initial derecognition amounts were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the change, which was reported as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings, was not material. As disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved over time, we may need to adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates needed to satisfy tax and interest obligations for the related issues. These adjustments may be favorable or unfavorable, increasing or decreasing earnings. See Note 7 for further details regarding income taxes.  Employee Benefits Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements. 63  Pension costs have been increasing in recent years, but are expected to decrease over the next several years, due to higher than expected investment returns experienced in recent years, as well as voluntary company contributions. While investment returns exceeded the assumed level of 8.75 percent in 2006 and 2005 and 9.0 percent in 2004, investment returns in 2007, 2003 and 2002 were below the assumed level of 8.75, 9.25 and 9.5 percent respectively, and discount rates have increased to 6.00 percent used in 2007. Xcel Energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and, in 2008, expects to maintain the investment return assumption at 8.75 percent and to increase the discount rate assumption to 6.25 percent. The investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period. This gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year, moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost determination process, and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period. Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will decrease from an expense, of $11.4 million in 2007 to income of $6.0 million in 2008 and income of $8.4 million in 2009. Xcel Energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from Moodys. At Dec. 31, 2007, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.56 percent, and the Aaa index rate was 5.41 percent. Accordingly, Xcel Energy increased the discount rate to 6.25 percent as of Dec. 31, 2007. This rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date, and will be used in 2008 pension cost determinations. At Dec. 31, 2006, the annualized Moodys Baa index rate was 6.35 percent and the Aaa index rate was 5.46 percent. The corresponding pension discount rate was 6.00 percent. The Pension Protection Act changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Xcel Energy projects that no cash funding would be required for 2007 or 2008. However, Xcel Energy expects to make voluntary contributions in 2007 and 2008 to maintain a level of funded status that allows for future funding flexibility and reduces cash flow volatility under the Pension Protection Act. These expected contributions are summarized in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future. However, all pension costs are expected to be recoverable in rates. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations, a one percent change would result in the following impact on the estimates recognized by Xcel Energy: Pension Costs +1% 1% (in millions) Effect on Dec. 31, 2007 Benefit Obligations: Rate of Return $ (19.8 ) $ 19.8 Discount Rate (4.9 ) 6.8 Effective Dec. 31, 2007, Xcel Energy reduced its initial medical trend assumption from 9.0 percent to 8.0 percent. The ultimate trend assumption remained unchanged at 5.0 percent. The period until the ultimate rate is reached is six years. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost increases experienced by Xcel Energys retiree medical plan. See Note 10 for additional discussion of Xcel Energys benefit plans. Xcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2007. For a discussion of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  Pending Accounting Changes Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure about the 64 use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets. Fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect the impact of implementation to be material. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159) In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which provides companies with an option to measure, at specified election dates, many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. A company that adopts SFAS No. 159 will report unrealized gains and losses on items, for which the fair value option has been elected, in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after Nov. 15, 2007. Xcel Energy does not expect the implementation of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)) In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins on or after Dec. 15, 2008. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 141R on its consolidated financial statements for any potential business combinations subsequent to Jan. 1, 2009. Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51(SFAS No. 160) In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, which establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity, but separate from the parents equity; the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings; and changes in a parents ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after Dec. 15, 2008. Xcel Energy is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial statements.  Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss or gain that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. These risks, as applicable to Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, are discussed in further detail later. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity and energy and other energy related instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy. 65 The fair value of the commodity trading contracts at Dec. 31, 2007, were as follows: (Millions of Dollars) Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Jan. 1, 2007 $ (1.2 ) Contracts realized or settled during the year (14.8 ) Fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year 22.3 Fair value of trading contracts outstanding at Dec. 31, 2007 $ 6.3 At Dec. 31, 2007, the fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset or liability balances were as follows: Futures/Forwards Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Futures/ Forwards Fair Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 1 $ (2,499 ) $ $ $ $ (2,499 ) 2 3,769 980 4,749 PSCo 1 (657 ) (657 ) 2 3,893 701 4,594 SPS* 1 63 63 2 163 38 201 Total Futures/Forwards Fair Value $ 4,732 $ 1,719 $ $ $ 6,451 Options Source of Fair Value Maturity Less Than 1 Year Maturity 1 to 3 Years Maturity 4 to 5 Years Maturity Greater Than 5 Years Total Options Fair Value (Thousands of Dollars) NSP Minnesota 2 $ (139 ) $ $ $ $ (139 ) SPS* 2 3 3 Total Options Fair Value $ (136 ) $ $ $ $ (136 ) (1) Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. (2) Prices based on models and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model. * SPS conducts an inconsequential amount of commodity trading. Margins from commodity trading activity are partially redistributed to SPS, NSP Minnesota, and PSCo, pursuant to the JOA approved by the FERC. As a result of the JOA, margins received pursuant to the JOA are reflected as part of the fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset or liability balances. Normal purchases and sales transactions, as defined by SFAS No. 133, hedge transactions and certain other long term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they are not recorded at fair value as part of commodity trading operations. At Dec. 31, 2007, a 10 percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for commodity trading contracts would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million. Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as VaR. VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time, with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions. Xcel Energy utilizes the variance/covariance approach in calculating VaR. The VaR model employs a 95 percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement, lognormal price distribution assumption, delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas. 66 VaR is calculated on a consolidated basis. The VaRs for the commodity trading operations were: During 2007 Year ended Dec. 31, 2007 Average High Low (Millions of Dollars) Commodity trading(a) $ 0.26 $ 0.47 $ 1.45 $ 0.09 During 2006 Year ended Dec. 31, 2006 Average High Low (Millions of Dollars) Commodity trading(a) $ 0.49 $ 1.32 $ 2.60 $ 0.39 (a)Comprises transactions for NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS. Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. At Dec. 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $12.7 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund costs of nuclear decommissioning. These trust funds are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. At Dec. 31, 2007, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities. These funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. The credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. At Dec. 31, 2007, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of $19.6 million, while a decrease of 10 percent would have resulted in a decrease of $12.0 million.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by operating activities Continuing operations $ 1,500 $ 1,729 $ 1,131 Discontinued operations 72 195 53 Total $ 1,572 $ 1,924 $ 1,184 Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations decreased $229 million during 2007. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital activity primarily the timing of accounts receivables and unbilled revenues. The decrease in cash provided by operations was partially offset by the collection of recoverable purchased natural gas and electric energy costs. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations decreased $123 million during 2007, largely due to the sale of related assets. Cash provided by operating activities for continuing operations increased $598 million during 2006. The increase is primarily due to the timing of working capital activity. Specifically, the collection of receivables and the collection of recoverable purchased natural gas and electric energy costs increased in 2006. The increase in cash provided by 67 operations was partially offset by the timing of cash expenditures for accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations increased $142 million during 2006, largely due to the realization of deferred tax assets related to NRG. 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities Continuing operations $ (2,023 ) $ (1,601 ) $ (1,362 ) Discontinued operations 51 136 Total $ (2,023 ) $ (1,550 ) $ (1,226 ) Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $422 million during 2007, primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash obtained from the consolidation of NMC and the sale of certain investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. No cash was provided by investing activities for discontinued operations. Cash used in investing activities for continuing operations increased $239 million during 2006, primarily due to increased utility capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash and proceeds from the sale of assets. Cash provided by investing activities for discontinued operations decreased $85 million during 2006, primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of Cheyenne and Seren in 2005. 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of Dollars) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Continuing operations $ 483 $ (422 ) $ 111 Total $ 483 $ (422 ) $ 111 Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations increased $905 million during 2007 due to increased short term borrowings as well as a decrease in the repayments of long term debt. Cash flow from financing activities related to continuing operations decreased $533 million during 2006 due to increased net repayments of short term borrowings in 2006 compared to 2005. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources.  Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures and Long Term Debt Obligations The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2008 through 2011 are shown in the tables below. By Segment 2008 2009 2010 2011 Electric utility $ 1,880 $ 1,375 $ 1,465 $ 1,775 Natural gas utility 145 160 160 150 Common utility and other 75 65 75 75 Total capital expenditures 2,100 1,600 1,700 2,000 Debt maturities 638 558 542 52 Total capital requirements $ 2,738 $ 2,158 $ 2,242 $ 2,052 By Utility Subsidiary 2008 2009 2010 2011 NSP Minnesota $ 1,005 $ 805 $ 910 $ 1,190 NSP Wisconsin 100 90 80 80 PSCo 825 505 530 590 SPS 170 200 180 140 Total $ 2,100 $ 1,600 $ 1,700 $ 2,000 68 By Project 2008 2009 2010 2011 Base and other capital expenditures $ 1,095 $ 1,135 $ 1,170 $ 1,170 MERP 170 25 10 Comanche 3 330 60 10 Minnesota wind/CapX 2020 transmission 40 65 115 300 Sherco capacity increases 5 20 75 230 Minnesota wind generation 135 Nuclear capacity increases and life extension 75 120 180 200 Nuclear fuel 150 150 140 100 Fort St. Vrain CT 100 25 Total committed capital expenditures $ 2,100 $ 1,600 $ 1,700 $ 2,000 Potential projects 0 100 200 400 200 400 200 500 Range $ 2,100 2,200 $ 1,800 2,000 $ 1,900 2,100 $ 2,200 2,500 Many of the states in which Xcel Energy operates have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which would require significant increases in investment in renewable generation and transmission. Xcel Energy would generally be able to meet these standards by either purchasing renewable power from an independent party or by owning the assets. Therefore, these standards may present Xcel Energy with the opportunity to increase its investment in wind generation and transmission assets. As a result, Xcel Energys capital expenditure forecast, as detailed above, may increase due to the potential increased investments for renewable generation and transmission assets. The other potential projects included in the table above represent wind generation, natural gas generation and transmission projects that may result from the Colorado and Minnesota resource plans that were filed in the fourth quarter of 2007. These potential projects will require commission approval. The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions and approvals, the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power, as well as alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energys long term energy needs. In addition, Xcel Energys ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements, compliance with future environmental requirements and renewable portfolio standards to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2007. See additional discussion in the consolidated statements of capitalization and Notes 4, 5, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years After 5 Years (Thousands of Dollars) Long term debt, principal and interest payments $ 12,599,312 $ 1,065,530 $ 1,849,818 $ 1,760,489 $ 7,923,475 Capital lease obligations 85,951 6,139 11,794 11,139 56,879 Operating leases(a), (b) 1,439,346 104,557 200,000 161,743 973,046 Unconditional purchase obligations 12,047,364 2,448,155 3,321,234 2,247,977 4,029,998 Other long term obligations WYCO investment 121,000 108,000 13,000 Other long term obligations(c) 165,847 31,589 42,775 38,964 52,519 Payments to vendors in process 145,059 145,059 Short term debt 1,088,560 1,088,560 Total contractual cash obligations(d) $ 27,692,439 $ 4,997,589 $ 5,438,621 $ 4,220,312 $ 13,035,917 (a)Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2006, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $176.8 million. In addition, at the end of the equipment leases terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value or equipment sold to a third party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the unamortized value. 69 (b)Included in operating lease payments are $76.6 million, $151.7 million, $124.5 million and $916.6 million, for the less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 4 5 years and after 5 years categories, respectively, pertaining to five purchase power agreements that were accounted for as operating leases. (c)Included in other long term obligations are tax, penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded according to FIN 48. (d)Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted based on indices. The effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (e)Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately $1.6 billion of goods and services through the year 2050, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures. Xcel Energy has also executed five additional purchase power agreements that are conditional upon achievement of certain conditions, including becoming operational. Estimated payments under these conditional obligations are $52.8 million, $165.7 million, $177.9 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, for the less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 4 5 years and after 5 years categories. Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy board of directors. Xcel Energys objective is to increase the annual dividend in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: Projected cash generation from utility operations; Projected capital investment in the utility businesses; A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and The impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The cash to pay dividends to Xcel Energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from its utility subsidiaries. The utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company. The limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from 30 percent to 60 percent. Some utility subsidiaries must comply with bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios. The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energys capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus, divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energys capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2007, was 85 percent. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energys ability to pay dividends.  Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock, preferred securities and hybrid securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Short Term Funding Sources Historically, Xcel Energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments. 70 As of Feb. 15, 2008, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: Facility Drawn* Available Cash Liquidity Maturity (Million of Dollars) NSP Minnesota $ 500 $ 323.4 $ 176.6 $ 8.7 $ 185.3 December 2011 PSCo 700 184.2 515.8 125.9 641.7 December 2011 SPS 250 103.0 147.0 0.3 147.3 December 2011 Xcel Energy holding company 800 179.8 620.2 4.6 624.8 December 2011 Total $ 2,250 $ 790.4 $ 1,459.6 $ 139.5 $ 1,599.1 *Includes outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit. Operating cash flow as a source of short term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather; regulatory requirements, including rate recovery of costs; environmental regulation compliance; changes in the trends for energy prices; supply and operational uncertainties and other changes in working capital, all of which are difficult to predict. See further discussion of such factors under Statement of Operations Analysis. Short term borrowing as a source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital markets. For additional information on Xcel Energys short term borrowing arrangements, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews and ratings. The following ratings reflect the views of Moodys, Standard & Poors, and Fitch. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. As of Feb. 15, 2008, the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various Xcel Energy companies: Company Credit Type Moodys Standard & Poors Fitch Xcel Energy Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB BBB+ Xcel Energy Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 NSP Minnesota Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB A NSP Minnesota Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ NSP Minnesota Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F1 NSP Wisconsin Senior Unsecured Debt A3 BBB+ A NSP Wisconsin Senior Secured Debt A2 A A+ PSCo Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB A PSCo Senior Secured Debt A3 A A PSCo Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 SPS Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ SPS Commercial Paper P 2 A 2 F2 Note: Moodys highest credit rating for debt is Aaa and lowest investment grade rating is Baa3. Both Standard & Poors and Fitchs highest credit rating for debt are AAA and lowest investment grade rating is BBB . Moodys prime ratings for commercial paper range from P 1 to P 3. Standard & Poors ratings for commercial paper range from A 1 to A 3. Fitchs ratings for commercial paper range from F1 to F3. In the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings to below investment grade, Xcel Energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral, letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees outstanding. See a list of guarantees at Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Xcel Energy has no explicit credit rating requirements in its debt agreements. Money Pool Xcel Energy received FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates. The utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to the holding company. NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. 71 The borrowings or loans outstanding at Dec. 31, 2007, and the SEC approved short term borrowing limits from the money pool are as follows (millions): Borrowings (Loans) Total Borrowing Limits NSP Minnesota $ (95.1 ) $ 250 PSCo 100.6 250 SPS (5.5 ) 100 Registration Statements Xcel Energys articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2007, Xcel Energy had approximately 429 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, Xcel Energys articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 7 million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. On Dec. 31, 2007, Xcel Energy had approximately 1 million shares of preferred stock outstanding. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities: Xcel Energy has an effective automatic shelf registration statement that does not contain a limit on issuance capacity; however, Xcel Energys ability to issue securities is limited by authority granted by the Board of Directors, which authority currently authorizes the issuance of up to an additional $1.1 billion of debt securities. NSP Minnesota has $1.5 billion of debt securities available under its current effective registration statement. PSCo has approximately $850 million of debt securities available under its currently effective registration statement.  Future Financing Plans Xcel Energy generally expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through internally generated funds. Xcel Energy expects to convert the $57.5 million principal balance of its Senior Convertible Notes due Nov. 21, 2008, to common equity by the maturity date of the notes. Xcel Energy plans to issue commercial paper to meet short term working capital requirements. During 2008, Xcel Energy plans to issue debt securities at several of its operating companies. These financing plans are subject to change, depending on capital expenditures, internal cash generation, market conditions and other factors. Current debt financing plans include the following: NSP Minnesota plans to issue between $400 $500 million of long term senior debt securities to refinance outstanding commercial paper, to fund utility capital expenditures and to provide funds for general corporate purposes. NSP Minnesota plans to issue commercial paper to meet short term working capital requirements, including funding for inter company loans to NSP Wisconsin. PSCo plans to issue between $500 $600 million of long term senior debt securities to refinance a $300 million long term debt maturity, to refinance outstanding commercial paper, to fund utility capital expenditures and to provide funds for general corporate purposes. PSCo plans to issue commercial paper to meet short term working capital requirements. NSP Wisconsin plans to issue up to $250 million of long term senior debt securities to refinance an $80 million long term debt maturity, to repay outstanding short term debt, to fund utility capital expenditures and to provide funds for general corporate purposes. NSP Wisconsin plans to issue inter company notes to NSP Minnesota to meet short term working capital requirements.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Xcel Energy does not have any off balance sheet arrangements, other than those currently disclosed, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 72  Earnings Guidance Xcel Energys 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations guidance and key assumptions are detailed in the following table. 2008 Diluted Earnings Per Share Range Utility operations $ 1.61 $1.71 Holding company financing costs and other (0.16 ) Xcel Energy Continuing Operations $ 1.45 $1.55 Key Assumptions for 2008: Normal weather patterns are experienced during the year. Regulatory approval of various riders associated with MERP, Minnesota and Colorado transmission and Minnesota renewable energy, which are expected to increase revenue by approximately $60 million to $70 million over the projected 2007 levels.
