Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments and Organizational Overview Continuing Operations Xcel Energy is a public utility holding company. In 2010, Xcel Energys continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in eight states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WYCO, a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipeline, storage, and compression facilities, and WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise the continuing regulated utility operations. Xcel Energys nonregulated subsidiary reported in continuing operations is Eloigne, which invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax credits.

Managements Strategic Plans Xcel Energys corporate strategy focuses on three core objectives 1) cost effective environmental leadership 2) achieving our financial objectives and 3) optimizing the management of our operating utilities. Our objective is to provide value to our customers and execute environmental initiatives by investing in our core utility businesses and earning a reasonable return on our invested capital. Below is a detailed discussion of our three primary objectives and how they support our overall strategy. Xcel Energys Environmental Leadership Overview Xcel Energys proactive environmental initiatives form one of three key strategic objectives. Xcel Energy believes that our environmental leadership initiatives have been successful in meeting customer and policy maker environmental expectations, while appropriately managing customer costs and hedging future environmental risk. This in turn, creates shareholder value. As a portfolio of regulated utilities, Xcel Energy has an obligation to serve its customers by providing them with reasonably priced, reliable electric and gas services. However, Xcel Energys strategy goes beyond this traditional mission. Under our environmental strategy, Xcel Energy takes prudent, balanced steps to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment while promoting technological and public policy advancements that will support a cleaner electric system at a reasonable price to customers: We continue to increase our use of efficient renewable resources. We provide our customers with energy efficiency options at the lowest cost available while reducing emissions and saving natural resources. We work with policy makers to undertake balanced, cost effective and proactive initiatives to reduce the emissions and environmental impact associated with our operations. Xcel Energy looks to advanced technology and business innovation to find cost effective means to meet, and where appropriate, exceed new environmental mandates. Finally, Xcel Energy seeks to reduce regulatory uncertainty through constructive cost recovery for environmental initiatives. As a result, we are well positioned to meet the challenges of potential climate change and other environmental regulation and comply with state and federal renewable energy, efficiency and other clean energy mandates. We believe that our leadership strategy has resulted in more efficient compliance with environmental mandates, by avoiding the cost and uncertainty of traditional, piecemeal environmental regulation. Our leadership strategy has positioned Xcel Energy with a diverse portfolio of energy resources, prevents excessive reliance on one form of energy production, and allows for more efficient, lower cost planning. Moreover, our strategy has allowed us to take advantage of favorable market conditions. For example, our acquisition of wind resources has not only positioned us to meet the requirements of state renewable energy mandates but our wind portfolio has been delivered to customers at prices that are competitive with energy that could have been provided by new fossil fired generating units. As a wh ole, our balanced environmental leadership strategy has provided our customers with both environmental and financial benefits. 49 Index The foundation for Xcel Energys environmental strategy resides within its environmental policy. Under this policy, the Xcel Energy Board of Directors, acting through the Nuclear, Environmental and Safety Committee, establishes environmental performance goals and oversees Xcel Energys environmental compliance program and policy initiatives. The policy is available on our website at www.xcelenergy.com. Pursuant to that policy, we have established a highly effective environmental compliance program and have produced an excellent compliance record. Xcel Energy has created an environmental management system that provides employees with training and documentation of Xcel Energys compliance responsibilities, creates processes designed to minimize the risk of noncompliance and audits Xcel Energys environmental performance.&# 160; Environmental performance goals, which include the goal of carbon reduction, consistent with our overall strategy, are incorporated into officer and employee job responsibilities and compensation. Our environmental leadership strategy resulted in numerous environmental awards and recognition. For example, Xcel Energy was named to the 2010 2011 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America leading index of companies considered best in class for corporate economic, environmental and social performance. This is the fourth year Xcel Energy received this distinction. Xcel Energy was named to the Carbon Disclosure Projects newly formed Carbon Performance Index for efforts to reduce GHGs. The American Wind Energy Association ranked Xcel Energy the nations number one wind energy provider for the past six years, and the Solar Electric Power Association ranked Xcel Energy number five among U.S. utilities for solar capacity for the past three years. Xcel Energy has achieved these ra nkings while at the same time maintaining a balanced strategy and providing our customers with energy at reasonable rates. As indicated above, in some circumstances our renewable energy initiatives have resulted in lower customer costs than a traditional, fossil only strategy. Xcel Energy strives to provide the public with detailed information regarding environmental performance and risk. Among other things, our utility companies operating in Minnesota, Colorado, and New Mexico use a carbon proxy cost mandated by the state commissions as part of its evaluation of the impact of potential GHG regulation on its future resource acquisition plans. Xcel Energy publishes a Corporate Responsibility Report annually, which is available on our website, www.xcelenergy.com. Current Clean Energy, Renewable Energy, Conservation and Transmission Initiatives Promoting Clean Energy In December 2010, the CPUC approved PSCos Plan, required by the CACJA, to reduce annual emissions of NOx, SO2 and mercury from five coal fired power plants in Colorado by more than 80 percent from 2008 levels by 2017. Xcel Energy, with approval from the CPUC, established the Innovative Clean Technology Program, an initiative to test promising new technologies with the potential to lower GHG emissions and result in other environmental improvements. Renewable Energy As noted above, Xcel Energy is the nations largest utility wind energy provider, holding this ranking for the last six years. In 2009 Xcel Energy had 3,176 MW of wind energy on our system. In 2010, this has grown to 3,432 MW. Xcel Energy plans continue to grow this to between 4,500 MW and 5,000 MW by 2015. Wind energy accounted for approximately 8 percent of our energy mix and by 2020, we project it will be approximately 16 percent of our energy. Xcel Energy has a number of environmental initiatives focused on our customers. Xcel Energy has the third largest customer driven wind program in the nation called WindSource. In 2010, NSP Minnesota completed the new 201 MW Nobles Wind Project in southern Minnesota. NSP Minnesota is also investing approximately $400 million for the 150 MW Merricourt Wind project located in southeastern North Dakota, expected to be operational by the end of 2011. Xcel Energy is the nations fifth largest utility solar energy provider, holding this ranking for the last three years. In Colorado, Minnesota and New Mexico, Xcel Energy manages a growing customer sited solar program, known as Solar*Rewards. In 2010, PSCo completed a solar demonstration project under the Innovative Clean Technology Program described above. That project tested the use of solar thermal energy to supplement a coal plant steam cycle and reduce the plants fuel consumption and emissions. Hydro provides 4 percent of Xcel Energys electric generation. Xcel Energy operates 27 hydroelectric power plants in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colorado, which can generate more than 500 MW and purchases large amounts of emissions free, reasonably priced hydro generated electricity from Manitoba Hydro. 50 Index Conservation Xcel Energys efficiency programs saved approximately 698 GWh of electric energy in 2010, and Xcel Energy is allowed a performance incentive in Minnesota, Colorado and New Mexico. Xcel Energy is also working to apply intelligence to its electric grid, creating a smart grid, to provide customers with more choice, reliability and control over their energy use. To that end, Xcel Energy has completed the nations first fully integrated SmartGridCity in Boulder, Colo., and is testing its potential to help manage energy consumption, improve service and reduce environmental impacts. Transmission In conjunction with its significant position in wind and currently with ownership with over 18,100 line miles, Xcel Energy is the fourth largest investor owned transmission system. Further we expect to invest an additional $3.8 billion in transmission through 2015. Xcel Energy is participating in a project called CapX2020 which is a joint initiative of 11 transmission owning utilities in the upper Midwest to expand the electric transmission grid by approximately 700 miles. The estimated cost of this initiative is $1.9 billion, consisting of four major transmission projects, with the goal of providing continued reliable and affordable electric service. NSP Minnesotas and NSP Wisconsins percentage ownership varies by project and its projected share of the investment is approximately $1 billion. Under Senate Bill 100 in Colorado, PSCo has proposed to build approximately 1,000 miles of transmission in the state, including the San Luis Valley Calumet Comanche project, where utilities commission approval is pending. PSCo is partnering with Tri State on the San Luis Valley Calumet Comanche Transmission Project, with an overall sharing percentage of approximately 60 percent to PSCo and 40 percent to Tri State. As of December 2010, partnerships and sharing percentages have not been determined for any other projects. In pursuing its environmental initiatives, Xcel Energy actively evaluates public policy proposals and promotes environmental initiatives that are designed to be reasonably priced, to assure compliance with state policies and programs, to manage long term customer costs and, where appropriate, to provide growth opportunities. GHG Emissions Xcel Energy is committed to addressing climate change and the threat of climate change regulation through efforts to reduce its GHG emissions in a balanced, cost effective manner. Xcel Energy adopted a methodology for calculating CO2 emissions based on the recently issued reporting protocols of The Climate Registry. Xcel Energy is a founding reporter under The Climate Registry. As third party CO2 reporting protocols continue to evolve, Xcel Energy expects additional changes in reporting methodology and reported CO2 emissions. Starting in 2011, Xcel Energy will also report GHG emissions to the EPA under the agencys newly adopted GHG reporting rule. Certain REC transactions include a transfer of environmental attributes. It is no t clear whether future GHG reporting regulations could require reporting of CO2 emissions for such REC transfers; current rules for EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program do not address REC transactions. Based on The Climate Registrys current reporting protocol, Xcel Energy estimated that its current electric generating portfolio, which includes coal and gas fired plants, emitted approximately 60.2 million and 60.1 million tons of CO2 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Xcel Energy also estimated emissions associated with electricity purchased for resale to Xcel Energy customers from generation facilities owned by third parties. Xcel Energy estimates that these third party facilities emitted approximately 20.3 million tons of CO2 in 2010. Estimated total CO2 emissions, associated with service to Xcel Energy electric customers, increased by 0.7 million tons in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in emissions was associated with an increase of 1.5 million MWh of generation. However Xcel Energys total emissions have a cumulative decrease of 55.0 million tons since 2003. In 2010, Xcel Energy completed the acquisition of the Blue Spruce Energy Center and Rocky Mountain Energy Center. Since Xcel Energy previously purchased the energy from these facilities, the combined CO2 emissions from owned and purchased generation will not change. The CO2 emissions from these facilities will now be included in emissions of owned assets. In 2010, Xcel Energys ownership share of Comanche Unit 3 resulted in CO2 emissions of approximately 2.1 million tons, and we estimate that Comanche Unit 3s 2011 emissions will be approximately 3.0 million tons. X cel Energy plans to implement clean resource development and conservation plans that will result in overall reductions in Xcel Energys CO2 emissions, including PSCos plan under the CACJA, both in absolute terms and per KWh of electricity produced. 51 Index State Resource Plans As a result of our resource plans, Xcel Energy would: Increase overall system wind capacity from approximately 3,432 MW at the end of 2010 to over 5,000 MW by 2015; Extend power purchases and exchange agreements with Manitoba Hydro through 2025 for NSP Minnesota; Continue expansion of our customer energy efficiency and conservation programs; Retire and replace several existing coal fired electric generation facilities with natural gas or combined cycle generation units at PSCo and NSP Minnesota; Install several SCRs for controlling NOx emissions and a scrubber for controlling SO2 emissions on specified units at PSCo; Improve the efficiency and reduction of CO2, mercury, SO2 and NOx emissions at several existing fossil plants at NSP Minnesota and PSCo; and Upgrade the capacity of existing nuclear facilities at NSP Minnesota. These plans are designed so that, depending on fuel, commodity and other assumptions, Xcel Energy would maintain a reasonably priced product and continue to provide reliable power to our customers. At the same time, the plans would result in a significant reduction in GHG emissions. Overall, Xcel Energy estimates that, by implementing these plans, we would achieve a GHG reduction of 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. Achieving Financial Objectives Xcel Energys financial objectives have three phases 1) obtaining legislative and regulatory support for large investment initiatives, 2) investing in the utility business and 3) earning a fair return on utility system investments. Obtaining Legislative and Regulatory Support The first phase is obtaining legislative and regulatory support for large investment initiatives, prior to making the investment. To avoid excessive risk, it is critical that Xcel Energy reduce regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments. Xcel Energy accomplished this through both the Minnesota and Colorado resource plans. The CPUC provided for recovery on CWIP in rate base in each rate case and deferred accounting of accelerated depreciation costs related to the CACJA. Xcel Energy obtained approval for several transmission lines through CONS in 2009 and 2010 for NSP Minnesota, and expects to file an application for SPS in March 2011. In addition, various jurisdictions adopted legislation allowing for rider recovery of investments in renewable energy. Investing in Our Utilities The second phase is investing in our utilities. Xcel Energy is projected to spend approximately $13 billion in capital investment from 2011 through 2015, as disclosed in more detail in the Capital Requirements section and in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition to Xcel Energys normal level of capital investment, Xcel Energy expects to have significant investment opportunity, in part attributable to the environmental strategy described above. As a result of these investments, as well as continued investments in the transmission and distribution system, Xcel Energy expects that the rate base, or the amount on which Xcel Energy earns a return, will grow annually, on average, by more than 7 percent from 2011 through 2015. Earning a Fair Return The third phase is earning a fair return on utility system investments. To this end, the regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders and DSM incentives, as well as general rate cases. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows recovery of certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing a rate case. These riders allow for timely revenue recovery of the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time. DSM incentives which exist in Colorado and New Mexico, and CIP incentives in Minnesota, allow Xcel Energy to earn from helping our customers reduce consumption. The incentive plans are designed to reward Xcel Energy for achieving performance at or above the approved savings goals. 52 Index Xcel Energys regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on utility investments. Xcel Energy believes that the public utility commissions will provide reasonable recovery, and it is important to note that the financial plans include this assumption. Constructive results over the last several years are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and give Xcel Energy confidence that Xcel Energy is pursuing the right strategy. With any strategic plan, there are goals and objectives. Xcel Energy feels the following financial objectives continue to be achievable: A long term annual earnings per share growth rate target of 5 percent to 7 percent; Annual dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and Senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. Successful execution of the corporate strategic plan should allow Xcel Energy to achieve the outlined financial objectives, which in turn, should provide investors with an attractive total return on a low risk investment. Optimizing a Portfolio of Operating Utilities Optimizing the management of a portfolio of operating utilities is the third area of focus related to the corporate strategy. Even though Xcel Energy ultimately manages the business based on the revenue streams provided by electricity and natural gas, Xcel Energy continues to evolve the management of the portfolio of utility investments. While Xcel Energy has four separate operating companies, there are certain similarities and differences that require us to effectively manage this portfolio. More specifically, Xcel Energys goal is to build on the similarities among the companies, which maximizes efficiencies from centralized management and deployment of common initiatives, such as market branding and environmental policy research. From an organizational perspective, examples of similarit ies include corporate center services as well as certain operational functions, such as management of the generation fleet, transmission systems, environmental compliance, government and legislative compliance, NERC and FERC compliance and safety programs. At the same time, Xcel Energy realizes there are unique differences in each of our service territories such as local community focus and priorities, regulatory environment, physical plant infrastructure and age, weather, as well as others that require Xcel Energy to organize and align these utility specific areas to most effectively address these utility distinct characteristics. To that end, Xcel Energy has operating company presidents, each located in their respective jurisdiction. The objective of this organizational structure is to optimize Xcel Energys operating efficiency while maximizing accountability. Financial Review The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements. 53 Index RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes the diluted earnings per share for Xcel Energy: Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 2010 2009 2008 PSCo $ 0.86 $ 0.72 $ 0.76 NSP Minnesota 0.60 0.64 0.65 SPS 0.17 0.15 0.07 NSP Wisconsin 0.09 0.10 0.10 Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 0.04 0.03 0.01 Regulated utility continuing operations 1.76 1.64 1.59 Holding company and other costs (0.14 ) (0.14 ) (0.14 ) Ongoing diluted earnings per share 1.62 1.50 1.45 COLI settlement, PSRI and Medicare Part D (0.01 ) (0.01 ) 0.01 Earnings per share from continuing operations 1.61 1.49 1.46 Earnings (loss) per diluted share from discontinued operations 0.01 (0.01 ) GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.62 $ 1.48 $ 1.46 Ongoing earnings exclude adjustments for certain items. For 2010, these adjustments are related to the COLI program, PSRI and to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicare Part D. For 2009 and 2008 these adjustments are related to the COLI program. See below under Adjustments to GAAP Earnings and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Xcel Energys management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energys fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energys management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Ongoing earnings for 2010, which exclude adjustments for certain items, were $1.62 per share, compared with $1.50 per share in 2009. Higher 2010 ongoing earnings were primarily due to improved electric margins as a result of new rates in various jurisdictions and warmer summer temperatures, which were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and property taxes. Ongoing earnings for 2009 were $1.50 per diluted share, compared with $1.45 per diluted share in 2008. Higher 2009 ongoing earnings were primarily due to improved electric margins as a result of constructive rate case outcomes in Minnesota, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, which were partially mitigated by the negative impact of weather, lower sales and higher purchase capacity power costs. Offsetting stronger electric margins were higher operating and maintenance expenses, resulting from increased employee benefit costs as well as higher nuclear expenses, and dilution from the issuance of equity to fund the capital investment program. Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings) 2010 Comparison with 2009 PSCo PSCo earnings increased by $0.14 per share for 2010. The increase is due to higher electric margin resulting from the full effect of two general rate increases, and warmer temperatures, which increased electric sales. The rate increases reflect the significant capital investments that PSCo has made in its utility operations. In addition, PSCos electric operations substantially under earned its authorized return in 2009. The higher electric margin was partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher property tax expense and depreciation expense. NSP Minnesota NSP Minnesota earnings decreased by $0.04 per share for 2010. The decrease is primarily due to higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense partially offset by the positive impact of warmer temperatures, higher earned incentives on energy efficiency and conservation programs and modest normalized sales growth. SPS SPS earnings increased by $0.02 per share in 2010. The increase is primarily due to electric sales growth, particularly in the commercial and industrial customer class, the reversal of previously established fuel reserves following the regulatory approval of certain settlement agreements and lower interest expense, which was partially offset by higher O&M expenses. 54 Index NSP Wisconsin NSP Wisconsin earnings decreased by $0.01 per share for 2010. The decrease is primarily due to fuel recovery and higher O&M expenses, partially offset by warmer temperatures which increased electric sales, as well as new electric rates, that were effective in January 2010. Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries The increase is primarily related to increased earnings from the equity investment in WYCO related to a natural gas storage facility that began operating in mid 2009. 2009 Comparison with 2008 PSCo Earnings at PSCo decreased by $0.04 per share for 2009. The 2009 decrease is largely due to the negative impact of weather and rising costs, partially offset by new electric rates that went into effect in July 2009. NSP Minnesota Earnings at NSP Minnesota decreased by $0.01 per share for 2009. The 2009 decrease is mainly due to the negative impact of weather and timing of nuclear outage expenses. The decrease was partially mitigated by a $91 million electric rate increase that went into effect in January 2009. SPS Earnings at SPS increased by $0.08 per share for 2009. The 2009 increase was primarily due to electric rate increases in Texas (effective in February 2009) and New Mexico (effective in July 2009) and the 2008 resolution of certain fuel cost allocation issues, which were partially offset by higher purchased capacity costs. NSP Wisconsin Earnings at NSP Wisconsin were flat for 2009. The 2009 earnings reflect increased costs, which were offset by improved fuel recovery and new rates which were effective in January 2009. Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by $0.02 per share for 2009 due to our investment in WYCO, which owns a natural gas pipeline in Colorado that began operations in late 2008 as well as a gas storage facility that commenced operations in July 2009. Adjustments to GAAP Earnings 2010 Comparison with 2009 COLI Settlement In July 2010, Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI entered into a settlement agreement with Provident related to all claims asserted by Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI against Provident in a lawsuit associated with the discontinued COLI program. Under the terms of the settlement, Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI were paid $25 million by Provident and Reassure America Life Insurance Company resulting in approximately $0.05 of non recurring earnings per share, in the third quarter of 2010. The $25 million proceeds were not subject to income taxes. PSRI In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, Xcel Energy recorded a non recurring tax and interest charge of approximately $10 million, or $0.02 per share, due to an agreement in principle reached with the IRS following the completion of a financial reconciliation of Xcel Energys statement of account dating back to tax year 1993, related to the COLI program. During the third quarter of 2010, Xcel Energy and the IRS came to final agreement on the applicable interest netting computations related to these tax years. Accordingly, PSRI recorded a reduction to expense of $0.6 million, net of tax, during the third qua rter of 2010. Impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicare Part D During the first quarter of 2010, Xcel Energy recorded non recurring tax expense of approximately $17 million, or $0.04 per share, of tax benefits previously recognized in income related to Medicare Part D subsidies due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in March 2010. Under GAAP, Xcel Energy was required to reverse these previously recorded tax benefits in the period of enactment of the new legislation. 2009 Comparison with 2008 PSRI PSRI is a wholly owned subsidiary of PSCo. During 2007, Xcel Energy resolved a dispute with the IRS regarding its COLI program. The 2009 impact is primarily related to legal costs associated with company claims against the insurance provider and broker of the COLI policies. Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations increased by one cent over 2009 primarily related to an increase in tax related expenses and legal accruals for previously divested businesses. 55 Index Changes in Diluted Earnings Per Share The following tables summarize significant components contributing to the changes in the diluted earnings per share compared with prior periods, which are discussed in more detail later.

Included in all other segment results in Note 17. 57 Index Statement of Income Analysis The following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of income. Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales while, conversely, mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energys financial performance. Degree day or Temperature Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each days average temperature and humidity. Heating degree days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65 Fahrenheit, and cooling degree days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree day. In Xcel Energys more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, wh ich adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energys residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less weather sensitive. Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20 year or 30 year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction based on the time period used by the regulator in establishing estimated volumes in the rate setting process. The percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are provided in the following table: 2010 vs. Normal 2009 vs. Normal 2010 vs. 2009 2008 vs. Normal 2009 vs. 2008 HDD (4.7 ) % 0.4 % (5.0 ) % 4.5 % (3.9 ) % CDD 10.8 (10.5 ) 23.8 1.0 (11.4 ) THI 27.8 (34.5 ) 95.1 (15.5 ) (22.5 ) Weather The following table summarizes the estimated impact on earnings per share of temperature variations compared with sales under normal weather conditions. 2010 vs. Normal 2009 vs. Normal 2010 vs. 2009 2008 vs. Normal 2009 vs. 2008 Retail electric $ 0.04 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.09 $ (0.01 ) $ (0.04 ) Firm natural gas (0.01 ) (0.01 ) 0.01 (0.01 ) Total $ 0.03 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.08 $ $ (0.05 ) Sales Growth (Decline) The following table summarizes Xcel Energys regulated sales growth (decline) for actual and weather normalized energy sales for the years ended Dec. 31, compared with the previous year. Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2009 Weather Weather Normalized Weather Actual Normalized Lubbock (a) Actual Normalized Electric residential 4.6 % 0.7 % 0.9 % (1.4 ) % 0.7 % Electric commercial and industrial 2.6 1.4 1.6 (3.3 ) (2.7 ) Total retail electric sales 3.1 1.2 1.4 (2.7 ) (1.8 ) Firm natural gas sales (2.9 ) (0.2 ) N/A (2.6 ) 0.1 (a) Adjusted for the October 2010 sale of SPS electric distribution assets to the city of Lubbock, Texas. During 2009, we experienced lower than anticipated actual electric residential sales, and a decline in electric commercial and industrial sales on a weather adjusted basis, which we believe was driven by overall economic conditions and to a lesser degree, increased conservation efforts. Sales in 2010 for the commercial and industrial class have shown signs of recovery. We anticipate that sales in the future will grow at a slower rate than historical levels, due in part to increased conservation activities. 58 Index Weather normalized sales for 2011 are projected to grow approximately 1.0 to 1.3 percent for retail electric customers and to remain relatively flat for retail firm natural gas customers. Electric Revenues and Margin Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses these price fluctuations have little impact on electric margin. The following tables detail the electric revenues and margin: (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Electric revenues $ 8,452 $ 7,705 $ 8,683 Electric fuel and purchased power (4,011 ) (3,672 ) (4,948 ) Electric margin $ 4,441 $ 4,033 $ 3,735 The following tables summarize the components of the changes in electric revenues and electric margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Electric Revenues (Millions of Dollars) 2010 vs. 2009 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery $ 288 Retail rate increases, including seasonal rates (Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico) 228 Conservation and DSM revenue and incentive (partially offset by expenses) 72 Estimated impact of weather 65 Retail sales increase (excluding weather impact) 18 Sales mix and demand revenues 16 Non fuel riders 15 Transmission revenue 14 Trading 2 Firm wholesale (11 ) Other, net 40 Total increase in electric revenue $ 747 2010 Comparison with 2009 Electric revenues increased due to higher fuel and purchased power costs, retail rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, higher conservation revenue and incentives and warmer than normal summer weather, primarily at NSP Minnesota. Electric Margin (Millions of Dollars) 2010 vs. 2009 Retail rate increases, including seasonal rates (Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico) $ 228 Conservation and DSM revenue and incentive (partially offset by expenses) 72 Estimated impact of weather 65 Retail sales increase (excluding weather impact) 18 Sales mix and demand revenue 16 Non fuel riders 15 Firm wholesale 9 Trading (7 ) Other, net (8 ) Total increase in electric margin $ 408 2010 Comparison to 2009 The increase in electric margin was due to retail rate increases in Colorado, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico, warmer than normal summer weather, primarily at NSP Minnesota and higher conservation revenue and incentives. 59 Index Electric Revenues (Millions of Dollars) 2009 vs. 2008 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery $ (1,237 ) Trading (73 ) Estimated impact of weather (26 ) Retail sales decline (excluding weather impact) (22 ) Retail rate increases (Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin) 218 Conservation and DSM revenue and incentive (partially offset by expenses) 74 Non fuel riders 22 MERP rider 17 2008 refund of nuclear refueling outage revenues due to change in recovery method 16 Transmission revenue 14 Sales mix and demand revenues 4 Other, net 15 Total decrease in electric revenue $ (978 ) 2009 Comparison with 2008 Electric revenues decreased due to lower fuel and purchased power costs, largely due to lower customer usage and lower commodity prices, lower trading and weather. This was partially offset by retail rate increases in Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, higher conservation and non fuel rider recovery, mostly from the RESA rider at PSCo and the TCRF rider at SPS. Electric Margin (Millions of Dollars) 2009 vs. 2008 Retail rate increases (Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin) $ 218 Conservation and DSM revenue and incentive (partially offset by expenses) 74 Non fuel riders 22 MERP rider 17 2008 refund of nuclear refueling outage revenues due to change in recovery method 16 NSP Wisconsin fuel recovery 14 SPS 2008 fuel cost allocation regulatory accruals 12 Firm wholesale 11 Sales mix and demand revenues 4 Purchased capacity costs (44 ) Estimated impact of weather (26 ) Retail sales decline (excluding weather impact) (22 ) Other, net 2 Total increase in electric margin $ 298 2009 Comparison to 2008 The increase in electric margin was due to electric rate increases in Colorado, Minnesota, Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, higher conservation and DSM revenue and non fuel riders. This was partially offset by higher purchase capacity costs and a negative impact of weather. 60 Index Natural Gas Revenues and Margin The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin. The following tables detail natural gas revenues and margin: (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Natural gas revenues $ 1,783 $ 1,866 $ 2,443 Cost of natural gas sold and transported (1,163 ) (1,266 ) (1,833 ) Natural gas margin $ 620 $ 600 $ 610 Natural Gas Revenues The following tables summarize the components of the changes in natural gas revenues and margin for the years ended Dec. 31: (Millions of Dollars) 2010 vs. 2009 Purchased natural gas adjustment clause recovery $ (100 ) Estimated impact of weather (8 ) Retail sales decrease (excluding weather impact) (2 ) Conservation and DSM revenue and incentive 18 Rate increase (Minnesota) 6 Other (including sales mix), net 3 Total decrease in natural gas revenues $ (83 ) 2010 Comparison to 2009 Natural gas revenues decreased primarily due to lower natural gas costs in 2010, partially offset by higher conservation and DSM rates.

Non Fuel Operating Expenses and Other Items O&M Expenses O&M expenses increased by approximately $149.2 million, or 7.8 percent, for 2010 compared with 2009, and by $130.2 million, or 7.3 percent, for 2009 compared with 2008. (Millions of Dollars) 2010 vs. 2009 Higher plant generation costs $ 47 Higher labor costs 24 Higher nuclear plant operation costs 20 Higher contract labor costs 18 Higher employee benefit expense 15 Higher nuclear outage costs, net of deferral 10 Other, net 15 Total increase in operating and maintenance expenses $ 149 2010 Comparison to 2009 The increase in O&M expenses for 2010 was largely driven by the following: Higher plant generation costs are primarily attributable to the timing of planned maintenance and overhaul work as well as incremental operating costs associated with new generation facilities placed in service in 2010. Higher contract labor is primarily related to maintenance on our distribution facilities. Higher nuclear plant operation costs are mainly due to increased labor and security expenses. Higher labor costs are primarily due to higher overtime for storm restoration work and a shift in labor resources from capital to O&M projects. Higher nuclear outage costs are due to the timing and higher cost of nuclear refueling outages. Higher employee benefit costs for the year are primarily due to increased pension costs partially offset by lower health care costs. (Millions of Dollars) 2009 vs. 2008 Higher employee benefit expense $ 90 Nuclear outage costs, net of deferral 30 Higher nuclear plant operation costs 21 Higher plant generation costs 9 Higher labor costs 6 Lower consulting costs (18 ) Other, net (8 ) Total increase in operating and maintenance expenses $ 130 62 Index 2009 Comparison to 2008 The increase in O&M expenses for 2009 was largely driven by the following: Higher employee benefits costs are primarily attributable to 2009 employee performance based incentive compensation expenses, higher pension expenses and increased medical expenses. In 2008, no employee performance based incentive benefits were earned. The increase in nuclear outage costs is due to the commissions approval of the change in the nuclear refueling outage recovery method from the direct expense method to the deferral and amortization method in 2008. The increase in nuclear plant operation costs is driven primarily by an increase in security costs and regulatory fees, resulting from new NRC requirements. Lower consulting costs are primarily the result of cost management initiatives achieved throughout 2009. Lower uncollectible receivable costs are mainly due to improved collections and a decrease in natural gas prices. Conservation and DSM Program Expenses Conservation and DSM program expenses increased by approximately $57.7 million for 2010 compared with 2009, and by approximately $64.4 million for 2009 compared with 2008. The higher expense is attributable to the continued expansion of programs and regulatory commitments. Conservation and DSM program expenses are generally recovered in our major jurisdictions concurrently through riders and base rates. Overall, the programs are designed to encourage the operating companies and their retail customers to conserve energy or change energy usage patterns in order to reduce peak demand on the gas or electric system. This, in turn, reduces the need for additional plant capacity, reduces emissions, serves to achieve other environmental goals as well as reduces energy costs to participating customers. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by approximately $40.8 million, or 5.0 percent, for 2010 compared with 2009. The change in depreciation expense is primarily due to Comanche Unit 3 going into service and normal system expansion. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $10.3 million, or 1.2 percent, for 2009 when compared with 2008. In 2009, NSP Minnesota began recognizing a 10 year life extension of the Prairie Island nuclear plant for purposes of determining depreciation, as a result of the MPUC decision in the Minnesota electric rate case. In addition, in 2009, the MPUC extended the recovery period of decommissioning expense by 10 years for the Prairie Island and the Monticello nuclear plants. These decisions reduced depreciation and decommissioning expense in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by normal system expansion. Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes) Taxes (other than income taxes) increased by approximately $25.5 million, or 8.3 percent, for 2010 compared with 2009. The increase is primarily due to an increase in property taxes in Colorado and Minnesota. Taxes (other than income taxes) increased by approximately $19.9 million, or 6.9 percent, for 2009 compared with 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased property taxes across our jurisdictions. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased by $21.4 million for 2010 compared with 2009. The 2010 increase is primarily due to the COLI settlement in July 2010. Other income (expense), net decreased by $30.6 million for 2009 compared with 2008. The net decline was mainly due to changes in non qualified benefit plan liabilities related to market activity, lower interest on under recovered deferred fuel balances and a decrease in interest received from WYCO for construction deposits. Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by approximately $5.3 million for 2010 compared with 2009. The annual increase is primarily related to increased earnings from the equity investment in WYCO related to a natural gas storage facility that began operating in mid 2009. Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by approximately $21.1 million for 2009, compared with 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased earnings from the equity investment in WYCO, as a result of the High Plains natural gas pipeline, located in Colorado, which commenced operations in late 2008 as well as a gas storage facility that began operations in mid 2009. AFUDC AFUDC decreased by approximately $30.7 million, for 2010 compared with 2009. The decrease is partially due to Comanche Unit 3 going into service in May 2010, as well as lower interest rates. AFUDC increased by approximately $12.9 million, or 12.6 percent, for 2009 compared with 2008. The increase was due primarily to the construction of Comanche Unit 3, as well as other construction projects. 63 Index Interest Charges Interest charges increased by approximately $15.6 million, or 2.8 percent, for 2010 compared with 2009. The increase is due to higher long term debt levels to fund investments in utility operations, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest charges increased by $8.7 million, or 1.6 percent, for 2009 compared with 2008. The increase was primarily the result of increased debt levels to fund new capital investments, partially offset by lower interest rates on short term debt. Income Taxes Income tax expense for continuing operations increased by $65.3 million for 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, and one time adjustments for a write off of tax benefit previously recorded for Medicare Part D subsidies and an adjustment related to the COLI Tax Court proceedings. This was partially offset by a reversal of a valuation allowance for certain state tax credit carryovers. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 36.7 percent for 2010 compared with 35.1 percent for 2009. The higher effective tax rate for 2010 was primarily due to the adjustments referenced above. The effective tax rate for ongoing earnings for 2010 was 35.3 percent. Income tax expense for continuing operations increased by $32.6 million for 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income. The ETR for continuing operations was 35.1 percent for 2009, compared with 34.4 percent for 2008. The higher ETR for 2009 was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state tax credit carryovers that are now expected to expire prior to full utilization. Excluding this item, the ETR for 2009 would have been 34.6 percent. Holding Company and Other Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energys nonregulated businesses and Holding Company results: Contribution to Xcel Energys Earnings (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Financing costs and preferred dividends Holding Company $ (72.9 ) $ (65.6 ) $ (69.7 ) Eloigne 5.4 (4.7 ) 1.5 Holding Company, taxes and other results 3.0 7.8 5.3 Total Holding Company and other loss continuing operations $ (64.5 ) $ (62.5 ) $ (62.9 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys Earnings per Share (Earnings per Share) 2010 2009 2008 Financing costs and preferred dividends Holding Company $ (0.16 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.15 ) Eloigne 0.01 (0.01 ) Holding Company, taxes and other results 0.01 0.01 0.01 Total Holding Company and other loss per share continuing operations $ (0.14 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.14 ) Financing Costs and Preferred Dividends Holding Company and other results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at the Xcel Energy and intermediate holding company levels, and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. Eloigne Eloigne contributed income of $5.4 million in 2010, and a loss of approximately $4.7 million in 2009, both of which are primarily attributed to the sale of property. Factors Affecting Results Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energys ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below. 64 Index General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. Management cannot predict the impact of a prolonged economic recession, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates. Fuel Supply and Costs Xcel Energys operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. Changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. However, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs. Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see Employee Benefits under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Regulation FERC and State Regulation The FERC and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are not requested annually in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, which is affected by overall economic conditions, conservation and DSM efforts and the cost of capital. &#16 0;In addition, the ROE authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. Wholesale Energy Market Regulation Wholesale energy markets in the Midwest are operated by MISO to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. MISO centrally issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin. In January 2009, MISO implemented modifications to the original market to establish a regional ASM. The ASM provides further efficiencies in generation dispatch by allowing for region al regulation response and contingency reserve services through a bid based market mechanism co optimized with the original energy market. NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin expect to recover MISO charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Capital Expenditure Regulation Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC, MPUC, SDPUC and PUCT approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, and or increase transmiss ion investment cost. These non fuel rate riders are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented or proposed to establish formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission investments increase in a manner similar to the rate riders. 65 Index Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to Xcel Energys air emissions. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately: $256 million in 2010; $225 million in 2009; and $213 million in 2008. Xcel Energy expects to expense an average of approximately $298 million per year from 2011 through 2015 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate. Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $473 million in 2010; $89 million in 2009; and $230 million in 2008. Xcel Energy expects to incur approximately $141 million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in 2011, and ranging from approximately $144 million to $301 million of related expenditures throughout the years from 2012 through 2015. Included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of generating plants in Minnesota and Colorado. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. Air Emissions Xcel Energys operations are subject to the CAA and similar state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate air emissions from various sources, including electrical generating units, and impose certain monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that Xcel Energy obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects that increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits that contain emission and operational limitations or mandate the installation and operation of expensive pollution control equipment at facilities. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements. Generating facilities throughout the Xcel Energy territory currently are subject to mercury reduction requirements only at the state level. In Minnesota, mercury emissions from two generating facilities, A.S. King and Sherco, are regulated by the Minnesota Mercury Legislation, which was promulgated in 2006 to provide a process for plans, implementation and cost recovery for utility efforts to curb mercury emissions at certain power plants. In Colorado, eight units are subject to a mercury emissions rule passed by the AQCC. Of those eight units, Xcel Energy only expects to install mercury emission controls on Pawnee Unit 1 by the end of 2011. The Pawnee mercury emission controls are included in the CACJA plan. During 2008 through 2010, NSP Minnesota completed sorbent control systems to reduce emissions at the Sherco Unit 3 and A.S. King generating plants. Following MPUC approval, such project costs were collected through the MCR rider. In December 2009, NSP Minnesota filed the plans for mercury control at Sherco Units 1 and 2 with the MPUC and the MPCA. In October 2010, the MPUC approved the plan, which will require installation of mercury controls on Sherco Units 1 and 2 by the end of 2014. 66 Index PSCo In April 2010, the Colorado Legislature passed the CACJA. This legislation required PSCo to submit a plan to the CPUC to reduce NOx emissions by 70 to 80 percent from at least 900 MW of existing coal fired generation by 2017. The purpose of the legislation was to develop a coordinated plan of emission reductions for utility boilers to comply with current and reasonably foreseeable CAA requirements such as regional haze, ozone nonattainment in the Denver, Colo. metropolitan area, control of hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases along with the reduction of GHG from power plant operations. In December 2010, the CPUC approved an emission reduction plan that included the retirement of several units, the conversion from coal to natural gas for two units and the addition of emission co ntrols for NOx and SO2 on three other units. The plan also includes the installation of two new natural gas combined cycle units to replace the retired coal fired boilers. Costs associated with implementing the plan are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion and are expected to be recovered through future rates with the plan fully implemented by the end of 2017. See further discussion in Public Utility Regulation. The EPA has required states to develop SIPs to comply with regional haze BART requirements, which included identification of facilities that will have to reduce SO2, NOx and particulate matter emissions under BART and then set BART emissions limits for those facilities. The AQCC promulgated BART regulations requiring certain major stationary sources to evaluate and install, operate and maintain emission controls meeting BART to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national visibility goal. The combination of plant retirements and the installation of emission controls resulting from the approved CACJA emission control plan noted above will be incorporated into the regional haze SIP for Colorado as a BART alternative. As discuss ed above, the state of Colorado will submit the final regional haze SIP to the EPA for its review in early 2011. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders. However, potential future inflation resulting from the economic and monetary stimulus policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect on the operation of the business and on the results reported even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policie s that are most critical to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Xcel Energy Board of Directors. Regulatory Accounting Xcel Energy is a holding company with rate regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates could be charged and collected. Xcel Energys rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of current and future cash flows. Regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued cost s that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets would be charged to expense and regulatory liabilities would be recorded as income. 67 Index As of Dec. 31, 2010 and 2009, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of approximately $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current earnings. While there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets, if the SEC should mandate the use of international financial accounting standards (IFRS) the lack of an accounting standard for rate regulated entities under IFRS could require us to charge incurred regulatory assets to earnings and regulatory liabilities to income. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities. Income Tax Accruals Judgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the ETR. ETRs are also highly impacted by assumptions. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year end tax assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.) by legal entity; adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual estimates being trued up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities have been completed. In accordance with the interim reporting guidance, a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to eliminate the difference in continuing operations tax expense computed based on the actual year to date ETR and the forecasted annual ETR. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes. At any period end, and as new developments occur, management will use prudent business judgment to unrecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline. As disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved over time, we may need to adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates needed to satisfy tax and interest obligations for the related issues. These adjustments may be favorable or unfavorable, increasing or decreasing earnings. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Employee Benefits Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations. Pension costs and funding requirements are expected to increase in the next few years. While investment returns exceeded the assumed levels from 2004 2006 and during 2009 2010, investment returns in 2007 and 2008 were significantly below the assumed levels. The investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises and are recognized over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees. Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will increase from an expense of $12.9 million in 2009 and an expense of $47.8 million in 2010 to an expe nse of approximately $79.2 million in 2011 and expense of approximately $113.1 million in 2012. The expected increase in the 2011 expense is due to the continued phase in of unrecognized plan losses primarily resulting from the market decline in 2008. 68 Index Xcel Energy set the discount rate used to value the Dec. 31, 2010 pension and postretirement health care obligations at 5.5 percent, which is a 50 basis point decrease from Dec. 31, 2009. Xcel Energy uses multiple reference points in determining the discount rate, including Citigroup Pension Liability Discount Curve, the Citigroup Above Median Curve and bond matching studies. At Dec. 31, 2010, the above reference points supported the selected rate. In addition to the reference points utilized above, Xcel Energy also reviews general survey data provided by our actuaries to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected. The Pension Protection Act changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. Xcel Energy accelerated its planned 2010 contribution of $100 million based on available liquidity, bringing its total pension contributions to $200 million during 2009. In 2010, Xcel Energy voluntarily contributed $34 million to one of its pension plans. In January 2011, Xcel Energy contributed $134 million, allocated across three of its pension plans. The January 2011 contribution raised the overall funded status from 84 percent at Dec. 31, 2010 to 88 percent with all other pension assumptions remaining constant. At this time, no additional contributions are planned for 2011. Projected pension funding contributions for 2012, which will be dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate, IRS and legislative initiatives as well as other actuarial assumptions, are estimated to range between $150 million to $175 million. For future years, we anticipate contributions will be made to avoid benefit restrictions and at risk status. These expected contributions are summarized in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future. However, all pension costs are expected to be recoverable in rates. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions at Dec. 31, 2010, a one percent change would result in the following impact on pension expense: Pension Costs (Millions of Dollars) +1% 1% Rate of return $ (30.2 ) $ 30.6 Discount rate (13.8 ) 14.4 Effective Dec. 31, 2010, Xcel Energy reduced its initial medical trend assumption from 6.8 percent to 6.5 percent. The ultimate trend assumption remained unchanged at 5.0 percent. The period until the ultimate rate is reached increased from three years to eight years. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost increases experienced by Xcel Energys retiree medical plan. Xcel Energy contributed $62.2 million and $48.4 million during 2009 and 2010, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $40.5 million during 2011. Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its regulated utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below. NSP Minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on expense as calculated using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method. Differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated under accounting guidance are deferred as a regulatory liability. Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions allow the recovery of other post retirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. The company has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 69 Index Nuclear Decommissioning NSP Minnesota owns nuclear generation facilities and regulations require NSP Minnesota to decommission its nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service. Xcel Energy records future plant removal obligations as a liability at fair value. This liability will be increased over time by applying the interest method of accretion to the liability. Due to regulation, depreciation expense is recorded to match the recovery of the future cost of decommissioning, or retirement, of its nuclear generating plants. This recovery is calculated using an annuity approach designed to provide for full rate recovery of the future decommissioning costs. Amounts recorded for nuclear AROs, in excess of decommissioning expense and investment returns, both realized and unrealized, cumulatively are deferred through the establishment of a regulatory asset for future recovery. A portion of the rates charged to customers is deposited into an external trust fund, during the facilities operating lives, in order to provide for this obligation. The fair value of external nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for those or similar investments. The fair values for commingled funds and international equity funds within the nuclear decommissioning fund take into consideration the value of underlying fund investments. Realized investment returns from these investments and recovery to date is used by regulators when determining future decommissioning recovery. NSP Minnesota conducts periodic decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will be incurred to decommission the facilities. The costs are initially presented in amounts prior to inflation adjustments and then inflated to future periods using decommissioning specific cost inflators. Decommissioning of NSP Minnesotas nuclear facilities is planned for the period from cessation of operations through 2067 assuming the prompt dismantlement method. The following key assumptions have a significant effect on these estimates: Escalation Rate The MPUC determines the escalation rate based on various presumptions surrounded by the fact that associated costs will escalate at a certain rate over time. The most recent decommissioning study set the escalation rate at 2.89 percent. An escalation rate for the cost of disposing of nuclear fuel waste was set at 6.0 percent. Over the short term, these rates can differ from the set rates and accrual estimates can be significantly affected by small changes in assumed escalation rates. Life Extension Currently, decommissioning recovery periods end in 2030 for Monticello and in 2023 and 2024 for Prairie Islands two facilities. Changes made to decommissioning cost estimates, the escalation rate and the earnings rate can be affected by changes to these life periods. With the recent re licensing of Monticello and the application for the re licensing of Prairie Island, any change in license life could have a material effect on the accrual. Current decommissioning cost calculations for Monticello have assumed full life extension, which brings the regulatory recovery period up to 2030. An application to extend the operating licenses for both reactors at Prairie Island by 20 years was submitted to the NRC in 2008. The NRC is expected to decide on the application in 2011. Prairie Islands operating license would be extended to 2033 and 2034 if life extension is approved. In the interim, the MPUC has extended the recovery period for Prairie Island Unit 1 to 2023 and Unit 2 to 2024. These changes were effective Jan. 1, 2009. Cost Estimate with Spent Fuel Disposal Federal regulations require the DOE to provide a permanent repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel. NSP Minnesota has funded its portion of the DOEs permanent disposal program since 1981. The spent fuel storage assumptions have a significant influence on the decommissioning cost estimate. The manner in which spent nuclear fuel is managed and the assumptions used to develop cost estimates of decommissioning programs have a dramatic impact, which in turn can have a corresponding impact on the resulting accrual. The decommissioning calculation covers all expenses, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material, and extends over the estimated lives of the plants. The total obligation for decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by a portion of the rates charged to customers, as approved by the MPUC and other commissions. Decommissioning expense recoveries are based upon the same assumptions and methodologies as the fair value obligations are recorded. In addition to these assumptions discussed previously, assumptions related to future earnings of the nuclear decommissioning fund are utilized by the MPUC in determining the recovery of decommissioning costs. Through utilization of the annuity approach, an assumed rate of return on funding is calculated which provides the earnings rate. With a long period of decommissioning and a funding period over the operating lives of each facility, the ability of the fund to sustain the required payments after inflation while assuring the appropriate investment structure is critical for meeting future decommissioning obligations. Currently, an assumption that the external funds will earn a return of 6.3 percent, after tax, is utilized when setting recovery by the MPUC. 70 Index Significant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned treatment of spent fuel. Materially different results could be obtained if different assumptions were utilized. Currently, our estimates of future decommissioning costs and the obligation to retire the plants have a significant impact to our financial position. The amounts recorded for AROs and regulatory assets for unrecovered costs are $969.3 million and $150.9 million, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2010, and $881.5 million and $207.0 million, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2009. If different cost estimates, shorter life assumptions or different cost escalation rates were utilized, this ARO and the unrecovered bala nce in regulatory assets could change materially. If future earnings on the decommissioning fund are lower than those estimated currently, future decommissioning recoveries would need to increase. The significance to our results of operations is reduced due to the fact that we record decommissioning expense based upon recovery amounts approved by our regulators. This treatment reduces the volatility of expense over time. The difference between regulatory funding (including both depreciation expense less returns from the investments fund) and amounts recorded under current accounting guidance are deferred as a regulatory asset. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Xcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2010. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Recent and Pending Accounting Changes Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. The guidance affects various elements of consolidation, including the determination of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether an enterprise is a variable interest entitys primary beneficiary. These updates to the ASC were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after Nov. 15, 2009. Xcel Energy implemented the guidance on Jan. 1, 2010, and the implementation did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. &#16 0;See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and required disclosures regarding variable interest entities. Fair Value Measurement Disclosures In January 2010, the FASB issued Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (ASU No. 2010 06), which updates the Codification to require new disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The requirements include expanded disclosure of valuation methodologies for fair value measurements, transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, and gross rather than net presentation of certain changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. The updates to the Codification contained in ASU No. 2010 06 were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2009, except for requirements related to gross presentation of certain changes in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2010. Xcel Energy implemented the portions of the guidance required on Jan. 1, 2010, and the implementation did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and required disclosures. Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss or gain that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of market risks associated with derivatives. Xcel Energy is exposed to the impact of changes in price for energy and energy related products, which is partially mitigated by Xcel Energys use of commodity derivatives. Though no material non performance risk currently exists with the counterparties to Xcel Energys commodity derivative contracts, distress in the financial markets may in the future impact that risk to the extent it impacts those counterparties. Distress in the financial markets may also impact the fair value of the debt and equity securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension trust, as well as Xcel Energys ability to earn a return on short term investments of excess cash. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists. 71 Index Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energys utility subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy. Changes in the fair value of commodity trading contracts before the impacts of margin sharing mechanisms for the years ended Dec. 31, were as follows: (Thousands of Dollars) 2010 2009 Fair value of commodity trading net contract assets outstanding at Jan. 1 $ 9,628 $ 4,169 Contracts realized or settled during the period (4,449 ) (21,740 ) Commodity trading contract additions and changes during period 15,070 27,199 Fair value of commodity trading net contract assets outstanding at Dec. 31 $ 20,249 $ 9,628 At Dec. 31, 2010, the fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset balance were as follows: Futures / Forwards Maturity Maturity Total Futures/ Source of Less Than Maturity Maturity Greater Than Forwards (Thousands of Dollars) Fair Value 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years 5 Years Fair Value NSP Minnesota 1 $ 5,914 $ 11,523 $ 976 $ $ 18,413 PSCo 1 573 1,245 1,818 $ 6,487 $ 12,768 $ 976 $ $ 20,231 Options Maturity Maturity Source of Less Than Maturity Maturity Greater Than Total Options (Thousands of Dollars) Fair Value 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years 5 Years Fair Value NSP Minnesota 2 $ 18 $ $ $ $ 18 $ 18 $ $ $ $ 18 1 Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. 2 Prices based on models and other valuation methods. These represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available. Internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms. The models reflect managements estimates, taking into account observable market prices, estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices, the risk free market discount rate, volatility factors, estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes. Market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the models. Normal purchases and sales transactions, as defined by the accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging, hedge transactions and certain other long term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they are not recorded at fair value as part of commodity trading operations. At Dec. 31, 2010, a 10 percent increase in market prices over the next 12 months for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.1 million. Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, using an industry standard methodology known as Value at Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions. The VaRs for the NSP Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, calculated on a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, were as follows: Year Ended (Millions of Dollars) Dec. 31 VaR Limit Average High Low 2010 $ 0.15 $ 3.00 $ 0.22 $ 0.64 $ 0.03 2009 0.50 5.00 0.44 2.02 0.06 72 Index Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. At Dec. 31, 2010, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $4.7 million annually. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries interest rate derivatives. Xcel Energy also maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. At Dec. 31, 2010, the fund was invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities, and other funds. These funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties nonperformance on their contractual obligations. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. At Dec. 31, 2010, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $72.4 million, while a decrease of 10 percent in prices would have resulted in a decrease in credit exposure of $0.1 million. Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase Xcel Energys credit risk. Fair Value Measurements Xcel Energy follows accounting and disclosure guidance on fair value measurements that contains a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value and generally requires that the most observable inputs available be used for fair value measurements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the amounts of assets and liabilities measured at fair value that have been assigned to Level 3. Commodity Derivatives Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterpartys ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts. Given this assessment and the typically short duration of these contracts, the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2010. Adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues when necessary. Credit risk adju stments for other commodity derivative instruments are deferred as OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. Xcel Energy also assesses the impact of its own credit risk when determining the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities. The impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities at Dec. 31, 2010. Commodity derivative assets and liabilities assigned to Level 3 consist primarily of FTRs, as well as forwards and options that are either long term in nature or related to commodities and delivery points with limited observability. Level 3 commodity derivative assets represent an immaterial percentage of total assets measured at fair value at Dec. 31, 2010. Level 3 commodity derivative liabilities represent 2.3 percent of total liabilities measured at fair value at Dec. 31, 2010. Determining the fair value of FTRs requires numerous management forecasts that vary in observability, including various forward commodity prices, retail and wholesale demand, generation and resulting transmission system congestion. Given the limited observability of managements forecasts for several of these inputs, these instruments have been assigned a Level 3. Level 3 commodity derivatives assets and liabilities include $3.6 million and $1.2 million of estimated fair values, respectively, for FTRs held at Dec. 31, 2010. Determining the fair value of certain commodity forwards and options can require management to make use of subjective forward price and volatility forecasts for commodities and delivery locations with limited observability, or subjective forecasts which extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges or quoted by brokers. When less observable forward price and volatility forecasts are significant to determining the value of commodity forwards and options, these instruments are assigned to Level 3. 73 Index There were no Level 3 commodity forwards or options held at Dec. 31, 2010. Nuclear Decommissioning Fund Nuclear decommissioning fund assets assigned to Level 3 consist of asset backed and mortgage backed securities. To the extent appropriate, observable market inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of these securities; however, less observable and subjective inputs are often significant to these valuations, including risk based adjustments to the interest rate used to discount expected future cash flows, which include estimated prepayments of principal. Therefore, estimated fair values for all asset backed and mortgage backed securities totaling $105.8 million in the nuclear decommissioning fund at Dec. 31, 2010 (approximately 7.6 percent of total assets measured at fair value), are assigned to Level 3. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning fund investments are deferred as a component of a regulatory asset for nuclear decommissioning. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,894 $ 1,913 $ 1,688 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $19 million for 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income and lower pension contributions made in 2010. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $225 million for 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income, changes in working capital due to the timing of accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory as a result of natural gas prices and an increase in plant related deferred income taxes. The increase was partially offset by increased pension contributions made in 2009 and higher AFUDC due primarily to the construction of Comanche Unit 3, a power facility located in Colorado. (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Cash used in investing activities $ (2,807 ) $ (1,735 ) $ (2,157 ) Cash used in investing activities increased by $1.1 billion during 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of two natural gas fired generation facilities and increased investment in utility operations primarily at PSCo, including the completion of Comanche Unit 3. Cash used in investing activities decreased by $422 million during 2009, primarily due to reduced capital expenditures; a withdrawal of funds, to refund customers, from the external decommissioning fund as approved by the MPUC; as well as reduced investment in the WYCO natural gas pipeline and storage project. No cash was provided by investing activities for discontinued operations. (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 906 $ (322 ) $ 671 Cash provided by financing activities increased by $1.2 billion during 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and common stock. Cash used in financing activities increased by $993 million during 2009, primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuances of long term debt and common stock and an increase in dividends, partially offset by lower repayments of short term borrowings. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources. 74 Index Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2011 through 2015 are shown in the tables below.

Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, reserve margins, the availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting Xcel Energys long term energy needs, compliance with future environmental requirements and RPS to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements. 75 Index Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2010. See the Statements of Capitalization and additional discussion in Notes 4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 to 3 4 to 5 After 5 (Thousands of Dollars) Total Year Years Years Years Long term debt, principal and interest payments $ 18,195,520 $ 598,011 $ 2,283,166 $ 1,400,650 $ 13,913,693 Capital lease obligations 417,166 18,523 34,989 33,412 330,242 Operating leases (a)(b) 3,150,020 177,327 379,375 406,600 2,186,718 Unconditional purchase obligations 10,010,629 1,860,084 2,311,469 1,676,557 4,162,519 Other long term obligations (c) 139,823 31,431 53,916 46,359 8,117 Payments to vendors in process 97,168 97,168 Short term debt 466,400 466,400 Total contractual cash obligations (d) (e) (f) (g) $ 32,476,726 $ 3,248,944 $ 5,062,915 $ 3,563,578 $ 20,601,289 (a) Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2010, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $99.0 million. In addition, at the end of the equipment lease terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value of equipment sold to a third party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the unamortized value. (b) Included in operating lease payments are $148.9 million, $332.4 million, $362.6 million and $2.1 billion, for the less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 4 5 years and after 5 years categories, respectively, pertaining to PPAs that were accounted for as operating leases. (c) Included in other long term obligations are tax and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as required by accounting guidance. (d) Xcel Energy and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted on indices. The effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (e) Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately $2.1 billion of goods and services through the year 2050, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures. (f) In January 2011, Xcel Energy contributed $134 million, allocated across three of its pension plans. At this time, no additional contributions are planned for 2011. Projected pension funding contributions for 2010, which will be dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate, IRS and legislative initiatives as well as other actuarial assumptions, are estimated to range between $150 million to $175 million. (g) Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $40.5 million to the postretirement health care plans during 2011. Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy Board of Directors. Xcel Energys objective is to increase the annual dividend in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent per year. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: Projected cash generation from utility operations; Projected capital investment in the utility businesses; A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and The impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries dividends may be limited indirectly or directly by state regulatory commissions, bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios. 76 Index The Articles of Incorporation of Xcel Energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Under the provisions, dividend payments may be restricted if Xcel Energys capitalization ratio (on a holding company basis only, not on a consolidated basis) is less than 25 percent. For these purposes, the capitalization ratio is equal to (i) common stock plus surplus divided by (ii) the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt. Based on this definition, Xcel Energys holding company capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2010 and 2009 was 84 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Therefore, the restrictions do not place any effective limit on Xcel Energys ability to pay dividends. Regulation of Derivatives In July 2010, President Obama signed financial reform legislation which will regulate derivative transactions amongst other provisions. Provisions within the bill provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC with expanded regulatory authority over derivative and swap transactions. This legislation could preclude or impede some types of over the counter energy commodity transactions and or require clearing through regulated central counterparties, which could negatively impact the market for these transa ctions as well as result in extensive margin and fee requirements. Additionally there may be material increased reporting requirements. The bill contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end users from much of the clearing and margining requirements. However, the CFTC is still developing the appropriate regulatory rules under the act and, at this time, it is not clear whether Xcel Energy will qualify for the exemption. If Xcel Energy does not meet the end user exception, the margin requirements could be significant. Xcel Energy expects the various definitions and rulemakings to be completed during 2011. The full implications for Xcel Energy can not be determined until that time. Pension Fund Xcel Energys pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, shortterm to long duration fixed income securities, and alternative investments, including, private equity, real estate and commodity index investments. Xcel Energy accelerated its planned 2010 contribution of $100 million, based on available liquidity, bringing its total 2009 pension contributions to $200 million. In 2010, Xcel Energy voluntarily contributed $34 million to one of its p ension plans. In January 2011, Xcel Energy contributed $134 million, allocated across three of its pension plans. The January 2011 contribution raised the overall funded status from 84 percent at Dec. 31, 2010 to 88 percent with all other pension assumptions remaining constant. At this time, no additional contributions are planned for 2011. Projected pension funding contributions for 2012, which will be dependent on several factors including realized asset performance, future discount rate, IRS and legislative initiatives as well as other actuarial assumptions, are estimated to range between $150 million to $175 million. The funded status and pension assumptions are summarized in the following tables: (Millions of Dollars) Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2009 Fair value of pension assets $ 2,541 $ 2,449 Projected pension obligation (a) 3,030 2,830 Funded status $ (489 ) $ (381 ) (a) Excludes non qualified plan of $47 million and $46 million at Dec. 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Pension Assumptions 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.50 % 6.00 % Expected long term rate of return 7.50 7.79 Long Term Contracts In response to the CACJA passed in Colorado, PSCo entered into a 10 year physical gas supply contract from January 2012 through 2021 for gas fired generation. Pricing is based on a formula and given current input assumptions; the notional value of the deal over the duration of the contract is in excess of $700 million. The contact was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2010 after receiving required approval from the CPUC. Acquisition of Generation Assets In December 2010, PSCo purchased the Blue Spruce Energy Center and Rocky Mountain Energy Center from subsidiaries of Calpine Corporation for $739 million plus an additional $3 million for working capital adjustments. The Blue Spruce Energy Center is a 310 MW simple cycle natural gas fired power plant that began commercial operations in 2003. The Rocky Mountain Energy Center is a 652 MW combined cycle natural gas fired power plant that began commercial operations in 2004. Both power plants previously provided energy and capacity to PSCo under purchased power agreements, which were set to expire in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 77 Index Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock, preferred securities and hybrid securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Settlement with Provident In July 2010, Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI entered into a settlement agreement with Provident related to all claims asserted by Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI against Provident in a lawsuit associated with the discontinued COLI program. Under the terms of the settlement, Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI were paid $25 million by Provident and Reassure America Life Insurance Company. Xcel Energy, PSCo and PSRI recorded this settlement of $25 million, or approximately $0.05 of non recurring earnings per share, in the third quarter of 2010. The $25 million proceeds were not subject to income taxes. Tax Law Changes On Sept. 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which contains a tax incentive package that includes a one year extension through 2010 of 50 percent bonus depreciation for businesses of all sizes. It extends for one additional year the 50 percent bonus depreciation provision enacted in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and subsequently renewed in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The provision had expired at the end of 2009. Under the bonus depreciation provision, 50 percent of the basis of qualified property may be deducted in the year the property is pla ced in service and the remaining 50 percent recovered under normal depreciation rules. The accounting impacts of the provision, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2010 were reflected in the third quarter of 2010. On Dec. 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, which retroactively extends the research credit for 2010 and 2011. Additionally, this Act extends the 50 percent bonus depreciation provision through 2012 and expands the deduction to 100 percent for qualified property placed in service after Sept. 8, 2010 through 2011. Sale of Lubbock Electric Distribution Assets In October 2010, SPS sold its electric distribution system assets within the city limits of Lubbock, Texas to LP&L for approximately $87 million. The sale and related transactions eliminate the inefficiencies of maintaining duplicate distribution systems, one by SPS and the other by the city owned LP&L. Short Term Funding Sources Xcel Energy uses a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments. Short Term Investments Xcel Energy, NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS maintain cash operating accounts with Wells Fargo Bank. At Dec. 31, 2010, approximately $45.7 million of cash was held in these liquid operating accounts. Commercial Paper Xcel Energy, NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS each have individual commercial paper programs. The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2010 was $653 million. The weighted average interest rate for Xcel Energys commercial paper during 2010 was 0.36 percent. In an order dated Feb. 4, 2011, NSP Wisconsin received regulatory approval to initiate a commercial paper program beginning in 2011. The authorized levels for these commercial paper programs are: $800 million for Xcel Energy; $500 million for NSP Minnesota; $700 million for PSCo; $250 million for SPS; and $150 million for NSP Wisconsin. 78 Index Credit Facilities As of Feb. 14, 2011, Xcel Energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: (Millions of Dollars) Facility (c) Drawn (a) Available Cash Liquidity NSP Minnesota $ 482.2 $ 5.3 $ 476.9 $ 31.9 $ 508.8 PSCo 675.1 152.0 523.1 18.0 541.1 SPS 247.9 43.0 204.9 0.4 205.3 Xcel Energy Holding Company 771.6 343.1 428.5 2.0 430.5 NSP Wisconsin(b) 0.3 0.3 Total $ 2,176.8 $ 543.4 $ 1,633.4 $ 52.6 $ 1,686.0 (a) Includes direct borrowings, outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit. (b) NSP Wisconsin does not currently have a specific credit facility; however, it does have a borrowing agreement with NSP Minnesota.

Xcel Energy plans to syndicate new credit agreements at the Holding Company, NSP Minnesota, PSCo, SPS and NSP Wisconsin during the first quarter of 2011 to replace the existing agreements. The total anticipated size of the new credit facilities will be approximately $2.45 billion. Money Pool Xcel Energy received FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short term investments in and borrowings from the utility subsidiaries and investments from the Holding Company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates. The money pool balances are eliminated during consolidation. The utility money pool arrangement does not allow the Holding Company to borrow from the utility subsidiaries. NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. NSP Wisconsin does not participate in the money pool. Equity Forward Instruments In August 2010, Xcel Energy entered into equity forward agreements in connection with a public offering of 21.85 million shares of Xcel Energy common stock. Under the forward agreements, Xcel Energy agreed to issue to the banking counterparty 21.85 million shares of its common stock. On Nov. 29, 2010, Xcel Energy settled the forward agreements by physically delivering 21.85 million shares of common equity and receiving cash proceeds of $449.8 million. The price used to determine cash proceeds was calculated based on the August 2010 public offering price of Xcel Energys common stock, adjusted for underwriting fees, as well as a daily adjustment based on the federal funds rate less a spread of 0.50 percent, and a decrease to reflect the dividend paid on Xcel Energys common stock in October 2010. Registration Statements Xcel Energys articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of 1 billion shares of $2.50 par value common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2010 and 2009, Xcel Energy had approximately 482 million shares and 458 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. In addition, Xcel Energys articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of seven million shares of $100 par value preferred stock.
